She was married. He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman’s body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals.Ryan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally.Three days after the video’s release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOP’s majority in the House.So, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.She claimed: Ryan is still endorsing Trump.Ryan’s dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip.At the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indiana’s primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump.Yet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time.Then in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying:It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.Early on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly.Clinton’s campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him.Other news accounts on the conference call were similar.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump, and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is no update in his position on Trump at this time.The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement.As for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clinton’s claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: There is no update in his position at this time.Clinton says Ryan is still endorsing Trump.As of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryan’s endorsement of Trump for president remained in place.",http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/after-donald-trumps-campaign-missteps-does-paul-ry/,

The post quoted another tweet, this one from POLITICO’s Jake Sherman, relaying the news that “@SpeakerRyan tells house republicans he won't defend trump and will focus the next 29 days on keeping the house majority.” Ryan’s decision to distance himself even further from Trump comes after a weekend in which the Manhattan billionaire’s campaign entered, and then seemingly pulled itself out of, its most recent death spiral. That most recent controversy began Friday when The Washington Post published clips from 2005 of Trump making incredibly vulgar remarks about women into a hot microphone, bragging that he “did try and fuck” a married woman and describing how his celebrity status allowed him to sexually assault women with impunity. At Sunday night's debate, Trump said that the 2005 comments were just ""words"" and that he had never actually carried out the actions he described. That statement that he had never committed such actions only came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked Trump three times if he had done them. In response, Ryan canceled a scheduled campaign appearance Saturday in the speaker’s Wisconsin home district. Rumors swirled for much of the weekend that vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, a devout evangelical Christian, was considering leaving the GOP ticket over the bombshell remarks, although Pence denied those rumors Monday morning. Ryan’s relationship with Trump has been far from warm throughout the presidential campaign. The House speaker was initially hesitant to endorse Trump and refused to do so even after the Manhattan billionaire assumed the title of presumptive nominee. But Ryan ultimately relented, endorsing Trump in an op-ed published in his hometown newspaper. That hasn’t kept the Wisconsin congressman from locking horns at times with his party’s bombastic nominee, including one instance over the summer when Ryan called Trump’s suggestion that a Hispanic judge could not rule fairly against him the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”",https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/paul-ryan-still-endorsing-trump-229544,

Paul Ryan’s view on this has long been “no comment,” and it sounds like after this morning’s big conference call with members of the House Republican caucus, that’s still his approach.Ryan says that he won’t defend Trump and he won’t work for his election, but he is still endorsing Trump and presumably will vote for him and hope he wins the election.As for his caucus as a whole, Ryan says that members of Congress should ignore questions of morality and the national interest and focus instead on short-term political expediency.Public policy has not really been at the center of the 2016 campaign, but under the heading of A Better Way, Ryan and his House GOP leadership team have hammered out a policy agenda that they expect a Trump administration would sign into law. Its centerpiece is a large tax cut whose benefits would almost entirely accrue to the wealthiest Americans. It is financed through a series of cutbacks to the social welfare state, with low-income Americans receiving less assistance in buying health care services, food, and other such things.In addition, the Ryan/Trump policy agenda would broadly push for less regulation of financial institutions and allow fossil fuel extractors to generate more air pollution.This agenda is distinct from Trump’s main agenda of deportations, police impunity, and trade protectionism but broadly compatible with it, and Trump has, at various times, signaled his alignment with Ryan’s priorities. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, would not really go along with any of Ryan’s main Better Way ideas.Under the circumstances, you can see why Ryan would want to see Trump elected even if he also doesn’t feel like putting himself out there as a defender of all the various things Trump has said and done and will continue to say and do.",https://www.vox.com/2016/10/10/13227444/paul-ryan-trump-endorse,

Ryan will not campaign with Donald Trump and told House GOP lawmakers to make their own decisions on whether to support the presidential nominee.The speaker has long said his priority was to save the House majority, but his explicit refusal to defend Trump at a crucial time was a stunning acknowledgement of the potential electoral loss.Trump chastised the speaker for his comments. Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,'' Trump tweeted.Ryan's approach also elicited protests from rank-and-file Republican lawmakers who said that fighting for Trump was the best way to stop Democrat Hillary Clinton's agenda.You all need to do what's best for you in your district, Ryan told Republicans, according to someone on the morning conference call granted anonymity to discuss the private session.Ryan reiterated his position that he would work to ensure Clinton does not get a blank check  with a Democrat-controlled Congress.But Ryan stopped short of yanking his endorsement of Trump, and told members he would not defend the presidential nominee or campaign with him for the remainder of the election.Congress is on recess but Republican leaders arranged the call to help lawmakers navigate the fallout from the tape of Trump's sexually aggressive comments about women.About a dozen members spoke up on the call, and most disagreed with Ryan's approach, according to sources on the call.One Trump supporter, Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, expressed his frustration that the party and its leaders were not unifying around Trump.The best way to ensure a Republican majority in the House is to make Donald Trump the most successful candidate we can make him, Cramer said. The idea that running from him strengthens that, I don’t buy that strategy.Even though Republicans are not expected to lose control of the House in November barring a major upset, Ryan needs to stem GOP losses to provide a cushion as he leads a majority hampered by infighting.According to a person on the call, Ryan will spend all his time and energy preserving the House majority, rather than campaigning with Trump.Ryan has had a difficult time with Trump's candidacy, first refusing to endorsee the nominee him, then reluctantly coming on board despite their many differences in style and substance.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-campaign-2016-updates-morning-1476114008-htmlstory.html,

The source said Ryan would spend his entire energy making sure Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with congressional majorities.The House speaker has campaign events for members of Congress scheduled in 17 states and 42 cities in October.Trump responded to the news by taking a shot at Ryan on Twitter:Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, added on Twitter that nothing's changed.Mr. Trump's campaign has always been powered by a grassroots movement, not Washington, he said.A firestorm was ignited Friday when a 2005 audio tape leaked in which Trump boasted about kissing and groping women.Trump apologized for the remarks in a video published just after midnight on Saturday, but many congressional Republicans are worried the comments and Trump's high negatives could put their own races in jeopardy.An avalanche of prominent Republicans condemned Trump's comments in the video, and some, including John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican, have gone as far as to call on the billionaire to step down as the nominee and hand the ticket over to his running mate, Mike Pence.Trump has refused to obey such calls. Instead, he doubled down during Sunday night's presidential debate, deflecting criticism over his lewd comments in part by pointing to former President Bill Clinton's history with women.The relationship between Trump and Ryan has been lukewarm throughout the election.Ryan shocked the political world when he initially refused to offer Trump his endorsement after the real-estate tycoon had secured the GOP nomination.

That's as it should be. That is what it is. I think something should be said about respecting those voters, Ryan said. He won it fair and square.Ryan brushed off Trump's comment from earlier this week in which Trump said he's not quite there yet as far as endorsing Ryan for reelection. Ryan said he's only interested in endorsements from employers in his congressional district. Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, told CBS This Morning on Thursday that Trump plans to support Ryan.He's going to support Paul Ryan, he does support Paul Ryan, he said he's going to work with Paul Ryan. There's no issue about that. He didn't take a position in the primary, he didn't take a position in many primaries. That's not the news. The news is the two of them working together to elect a Republican Congress and a Republican president, and I think you're going to see that, Manafort said.Since Ryan endorsed Trump in June, he said Thursday that he has not shied away from calling Trump out if it's warranted and will continue to do so.I said at that time, 'If I see a situation where our conservative principles are being distorted, I'm going to stand up for those conservative principles,' Ryan said. I'm not going to sit by and say nothing. That's what I said I would do, and that's what I'm continuing to do.Asked again if there ever would be a point at which Trump could go too far, Ryan said, Of course there is. That's with any situation like this.He also said that Trump has had a pretty strange run since the convention in Cleveland last month and that it's a shame that Republicans aren't focusing on Hillary Clinton.It is distressing that that's not what we're talking about these days, Ryan said.Ryan praised Trump's vice presidential nominee Mike Pence for being part of the conservative movement while serving in the House and how he fought against the earmark machine with him and supported his early budget blueprints.We were part of the original insurgent movement in Congress, Ryan said.Ryan also slammed his primary opponent Paul Nehlen, saying that he's been making stuff up and hoping it will stick with voters in Wisconsin.He's running this sort of make-it-up-as-you-go campaign, Ryan said.Trump will hold a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Friday afternoon and the state's three top Republicans -- Ryan, Gov.

He did, however, stop short of formally withdrawing his support for Mr Trump.",Open warfare breaks out between Trump and Paul Ryan following unprecedented announcement,"Open warfare has broken out between Donald Trump and the senior leadership of the Republicans after the party’s most senior elected official said he would not campaign for the presidential nominee. Reports said he implied it was all but certain that the Democrats were poised to win the White House.In a development that left political historians struggling to find a precedent, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that he would focus on helping members of the Congress get reelected rather than putting his efforts into helping the presidential candidate. He did, however, stop short of formally withdrawing his support for Mr Trump.Mr Ryan made his comments during an emergency meeting of Republican politicians in Washington, where he said he would neither defend him or campaign with him. Mr Ryan told his members that “you all need to do what’s best for you in your district”, according to a report by Politico.Mr Trump was quick to hit back on Twitter. “Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,” he said.The Republicans’ Dana Rohrabacher of California said party members distancing themselves from Mr Trump were “cowards”.Meanwhile the Representative for Arizona, Trent Franks, said the move would clear the way for Hillary Clinton to enter the White House, and referencing her stance on abortion, said it would end with foetuses being torn “limb from limb”.The relationship between Mr Trump and Mr Ryan and other senior Republicans has never been anything but cold. The Republican establishment was desperate to nominate any candidate other than Mr Trump, who tore up Republican orthodoxies, vowed to shake up Washington and was not afraid to criticise Republican officials.After Mr Trump became the de facto Republican candidate when all other candidate dropped out, Mr Ryan said he was still not ready to endorse the new York tycoon. He eventually did so by means of an op-ed article in his local paper.Mr Trump has similarly not hidden his disdain for Mr Ryan and other senior elected Republicans. At various times during his campaign, he has asked that they be quiet if they are not prepared to help him.Mr Ryan was one of many senior officials who denounced comments by Mr Trump that were published last week and in which boasted about sexually assaulting women. The comments were recorded in 2005 while filming a segment for Access Hollywood.Mr Trump has grudgingly apologised for the comments. But he has also said they pale in comparison to the real sexual history of Bill Clinton, who over the years had been accused of sexual assault by a series of women. He said Ms Clinton was guilty of attacking many of those women who had claimed they had been assaulted.Reuters said that in his conversation with fellow Republicans on Monday,Mr Ryan said that he would spend the remainder of the election campaign making sure that if Ms Clinton wins in November, she does not get a “blank check” in the form of Democrat-controlled Congress. Republicans currently control both the House and Senate.Republican members of Congress are worried that Mr Trump’s campaign could ruin their chances of holding their majorities in the elections and inflict long-term damage on the party.Nearly half of all 332 incumbent Republican senators, congress members and governors have condemned Mr Trump's remarks, and roughly 1 in 10 have called on him to drop out of the race, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage.But any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot this close to Election Day would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.A defiant Mr Trump went on the offensive in a vicious presidential debate on Sunday, saying Ms Clinton would go to jail if he were president and attacking her husband, Mr Clinton, for his treatment of women.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/paul-ryan-says-he-will-not-support-speaker-donald-trump-as-open-warfare-breaks-out-among-republicans-a7354796.html,

But by declining to immediately withdraw his endorsement of the Republican presidential nominee, the House speaker missed a chance to take a principled stand.Ryan has worked to brand himself as a compassionate conservative—a lawmaker who has put forward an agenda to improve the lives of everyday Americans while promoting conservative values. After failing to fully withdraw support for Trump in the wake of his comments—which degrade women and seem to glorify sexual assault—it will be far more difficult for Ryan to credibly promote himself that way. Especially when other Republicans, like senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte, have used this latest controversy as an opportunity to jump ship and pull their support from the GOP nominee.Despite assertions to the contrary, Ryan has not abandoned Trump so long as he continues to endorse him. An endorsement is, after all, an implicit approval of what a candidate says and does. So far, Trump’s campaign has included attacks on a Gold Star family, accusations of ethnic bias against a judge, and threats to jail Hillary Clinton. Ryan can condemn Trump’s remarks all he likes. But if he maintains his endorsement going forward, he’ll be asked to answer for Trump all the same. The Clinton campaign is certainly trying to tie Ryan to Trump over the endorsement, as the Republican nominee’s standing in the polls slips and Democrats attempt to retake the House.For his part, Ryan has tried hard in recent days to distance himself from Trump. After criticizing the taped remarks, Ryan announced that Trump would no longer attend an event in Wisconsin where the two had been slated to appear. That wasn’t all: “Ryan told House Republicans on a conference call Monday morning that he’s done defending Donald Trump and will focus on maintaining his party’s increasingly imperiled House majority,” Politico reported. Crucially, though, the story noted that “Ryan stopped short of formally rescinding his endorsement of Trump.” On Tuesday, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, confirmed that “there is no update” on the endorsement when asked if it still stands, though she added: “The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities.”Ryan’s actions aren’t without risk, even if he hasn’t entirely denounced Trump. Ever since he announced his endorsement in June, the speaker has gambled that voters won’t view his decision to support his party’s nominee—a man whom he has criticized many times—as evidence that he is willing to sell out his principles for politics. His latest attempt to distance himself will inevitably incite backlash from some conservative voters who feel the Republican Party hasn’t adequately supported Trump. It already appears to have incensed the GOP nominee. “Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.The House speaker faces a difficult political calculus, and one that is different from most Republican elected officials. As the top-ranking House Republican, Ryan faces far more pressure to show loyalty to his party’s nominee than rank-and-file congressional Republicans. Now that Trump is openly feuding with Ryan, a rescinded endorsement would escalate tensions within the party—between Trump loyalists and critics, and among those worried about the future of the GOP. The ensuing chaos could depress Republican voter turnout and hurt down-ballot candidates. Yet even for that pressure, Ryan may be anxious that continuing to support Trump will imperil his reputation as a principled conservative, and along with it his political future.",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/paul-ryan-donald-trump-endorsement/503657/,

A moment earlier, Ryan had talked about getting “beneath the personality question.” But, as the subject switched to Trump, he answered with what sounded like eager anticipation. “Yes—I’ve spoken to him a number of times and he does support our agenda,” Ryan said. “So I do know we have common cause on the big, critical foundational issues of the day.”Earlier in the weekend, Ryan was in Nevada, campaigning for two congressional candidates there. As he talked about a letter that James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., had sent to congressional leaders about a new cache of e-mails possibly related to Hillary Clinton’s private server, he said, “For the young people here who didn’t live in the ’90s, like we did, this is what life is like with the Clintons,” according to the Las Vegas Sun . “It’s scandal after scandal after scandal. Right around the corner, another investigation, you don’t know what’s coming next, playing by a different set of rules, using the system to help themselves, not to help us. Good grief. Do we want four years of this?”It was an easy shot. But, even before the Comey news broke, Ryan had called on James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, to bar Clinton from getting the classified briefings that both Presidential candidates receive on the grounds that she couldn’t be trusted with classified information. He was, apparently, fine with Trump getting his.This was the Paul Ryan who, in the popular imagination, is nearly crippled by his dismay at the unfitness and the amoralism of Donald Trump. After the revelation of outtakes from “Access Hollywood,” in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, Ryan let it be known that he would no longer “defend” Trump—because Ryan, as he wanted people to understand, was not that sort of guy. He was an ideas man; all he cared about were conservative principles and holding the House by any means necessary. One of his ideas, though, was that he would still endorse Trump. That detail is one that people on both sides of the political spectrum tend to overlook. Some Democrats, hungrily looking for evidence of Trump’s isolation, saw Ryan as a man who simply couldn’t sully himself by spending a minute more in the demagogue’s camp.At the same time, the endorsement wasn’t quite enough for the more radical Republicans in the House’s Freedom Caucus, who are threatening to bring down Ryan because, among other reasons, they do not view him as sufficiently pro-Trump. But it is a measure of the irrationality of some in the caucus that they don’t appreciate everything that Ryan has been doing for Trump. Earlier in the interview with KETV, he said, of the election, “We need to win the whole thing so we can get our ideas into law.” On Tuesday morning, on “ Fox & Friends ,” Ryan said that he had already cast his vote for “our nominee” in early voting in Wisconsin, adding, “We need to support our entire Republican ticket.” Then he started talking about Clinton scandals. (“They live beyond the rules.”) Asked how much his proposals on Obamacare had in common with Trump’s, Ryan said they were “virtually at one and the same. We’ve talked with Donald all year long on these things . . . same with rebuilding national security, securing the border.” In other words, his job was not just keeping the House to provide a divided-government bulwark against the Democrats in an election against Hillary Clinton; his job was to beat her.Perhaps there is no practical alternative: he is one of his party’s leaders. But could we, then, put aside the idea that there is something remarkable and almost touching about his dilemma? The “ideas” that he always wishes he could make this election about are on the far-conservative end of the Republican Party spectrum. (Stripping away the social safety net, defunding Planned Parenthood.) He has said that one of the reasons he is eager to see Trump elected is that he believes he’d like the look of a Trump Supreme Court. Ryan had, even before the “Access Hollywood” video emerged, avoided talking too much about Trump, at least in his most visible speeches. But he has counterbalanced that, and done what he can to placate conservatives, by demonizing Hillary Clinton. Hours after Comey’s announcement, he put out a statement that began, “Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation’s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.” Comey’s move, he said, was “long overdue.” There was an accompanying tweet of the “nobody but herself to blame” line, with a photo of a frustrated-looking Clinton with her hand to her head. More tweets on the subject followed. (“Do we really want four more years of this?”)If Clinton does win, and Ryan remains the House Speaker, how much support he gives his caucus in its search for scandals will matter. And if campaign rhetoric is any indication, the House will become a baroque tableau of hearings and investigations. That may be a requirement for him to keep his job; it may also be what he wants himself.The same day Ryan campaigned in Nebraska, “ This American Life ” did a segment in which Ira Glass, the host, spoke about the supposed tragedy of Paul Ryan. “He exercises and he’s careful about his diet and he’s a policy nerd and he’s polite and he’s kind of proper,” and yet his voters were going for someone, Trump, with the opposite qualities. Some of them, though, are likely doing so because Ryan is endorsing Trump. In some states where Republican leaders refused to do so or renounced their endorsement—notably, Utah—it seems to have made a difference. It is possible that political leadership and courage still matter more than political theatre. “This American Life” commissioned a song, performed by Neal Patrick Harris, in which a sad Paul Ryan articulated what he’d tell Republican voters if he dared: “It hurt to see you running to him / I hope in time you’ll see right through him / And I’ll be there when the nightmare has ended.” On the awkward point of the endorsement: “It’s only for your sake that I endorsed / I’m sure you could tell it was completely forced.”Not really. Paul Ryan does seem to be conflicted. But, on the basis of the evidence, the conflict is not between his principles and his partisan obligations but between his intellectual vanity and his opportunism. He is not emblematic of a party that got hijacked but of one that hoped to simultaneously achieve a radical agenda, play to its base’s worst fears, and still be celebrated in polite society. And that is not, in the end, a very interesting study in character. Paul Ryan may just be a very ordinary politician.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-on-the-road-for-donald-trump,

On Monday, Trump said he may endorse the House speaker in his primary on Tuesday, but he’s “just not quite there yet.” Then he took to Twitter to thank Ryan’s challenger Paul Nehlen — who’s been described as a “mini-Trump” — for his “kind words.”But Trump also let his running mate Mike Pence endorse Ryan (both men made it clear that the governor had to ask his permission), and tried to downplay the conflict, which outraged many Republican lawmakers. The New York Times reports that during a rally in Maine on Thursday, Trump called Ryan a “good guy” and urged his supporters to stop when they booed the speaker.Meanwhile, Ryan stuck with his awkward strategy of endorsing the nominee while condemning his actions. In an interview with WTAQ radio in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Ryan reiterated the obvious point that politicians should not insult the families of service members killed in action, and even called Trump’s last week on the campaign trail a “pretty strange run.” He explained that he’s still supporting Trump because “grassroots Republican primary voter selects our nominee,” and their will should be respected. But when asked if there could come a point when he would abandon the GOP presidential ticket, Ryan said, “None of these things are ever blank checks.”Ryan went on to use the phrase “blank check” several times, including in a fundraising appeal that went out Thursday evening. “If we fail to protect our majority in Congress, we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check,” it said. Aside from the implication that Ryan has little faith that Trump will win the election, the Washington Post notes that “blank check” is a loaded term for Republicans:If Republican leaders are planning to distance themselves from the nominee to save their majorities in Congress, Sean Hannity won’t let them get away with it. In a rant on Wednesday’s edition of his talk-radio show, he vowed to hold Ryan and those of his ilk responsible in the event of a Trump loss:“If in 96 days Trump loses this election, I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain,” Hannity said. “I have watched these Republicans be more harsh toward Donald Trump than they’ve ever been in standing up to Barack Obama and his radical agenda.”Then on Thursday night, he let loose on The Wall Street Journal’s Bret Stephens, who wrote a column earlier this week calling on Republicans to abandon Trump:Well, if Trump loses and Democrats take Congress, at least Republicans will still have each other.",http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/ryan-is-endorsing-trump-anticipating-president-clinton.html,

Trump has doubled and tripled down on the attacks—and has ordered his surrogates to do the same—even though he has no support inside the Republican Party on the issue. Many of Trump’s closest allies, including Newt Gingrich, have condemned his remarks, which means that Capitol Hill Republicans—many of whom will be up for reelection in the fall—are beside themselves. The Democrats are taking this controversy national, revealing a strategy to saddle every Republican across the country with Trump’s antics. Politico reports that Trump’s attacks on the judge “are sapping any goodwill [Trump] had accumulated in private meetings and phone calls with congressional Republicans.” Which brings us back to Paul Ryan. If Ryan hadn’t endorsed Trump literally the day before he began his racist rampage, he would have had some leverage in getting him to stop. But Ryan wasted all his political capital by tying his fate to Trump’s. When Ryan finally spoke out against Trump’s comments, he just sounded tired: “[H]e clearly says and does things I don’t agree with, and I’ve had to speak up on time to time when that has occurred, and I’ll continue to do that if it’s necessary.

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, and former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush also did not attend the convention.Trump has had a running dispute with Khizr and Ghazala Khan since they took the stage at last week’s Democratic convention to cite their son’s sacrifice and criticize Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.The uproar has led many Republicans to distance themselves from Trump and voice support for the Khan family.Trump, mirroring the language Ryan used about supporting the nominee before his eventual endorsement, told the newspaper he was “not quite there yet” on endorsing Ryan in next Tuesday’s Wisconsin primary, and that he had “never been there” with McCain, who will be on the ballot in primary elections in Arizona later this month.McCain had a “very friendly” meeting with Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, on Tuesday in Arizona, where Pence was visiting, a McCain spokeswoman said.Trump said Ryan had sought his endorsement, but that as of now he is only “giving it very serious consideration.”Ryan’s campaign office quickly responded that “neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump’s endorsement.”“And we are confident in a victory next week regardless,” campaign spokesman Zack Roday said in a statement.Ryan is favored to win against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, who Trump praised as running “a very good campaign.” In a mid-July survey by Harper Polling, Ryan was ahead of Nehlen by nearly 50 points.Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting style, and controversial policies, including the proposed ban on Muslims and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants.President Barack Obama on Tuesday blasted Trump as unfit to be president and questioned why any Republican would support the New York businessman, who is seeking his first public office.“The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable: Why are you still endorsing him?” Obama, a Democrat, said at a White House news conference with Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.The chorus of complaints against Trump grew on Tuesday.Representative Richard Hanna of New York became the first Republican in Congress to endorse Democratic nominee Hillary, although several other Republicans in Congress have said they will not support Trump.Hanna, who is retiring from the House of Representatives rather than seek re-election, said his decision was prompted by Trump’s attacks on the Khan family. He called Trump “deeply flawed in endless ways,” “unrepentant” and “self-involved.”New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump ally once viewed by Trump as a potential running mate, called criticisms of the Khan family “inappropriate.”Trump’s son Eric told CBS News on Tuesday that his father’s comments about the Khans have been “blown hugely out of proportion.”Trump has fallen behind Clinton in opinion polls made public since the parties held their nominating conventions last month.Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 8 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from 6 points on Friday. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked “other.”Trump also has trailed Clinton in fundraising. Clinton reported raising nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors.Interviewed on the Fox Business television network, Trump brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s blistering critique of his business acumen.Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trump’s 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying the business lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trump’s company.Trump, who has said his business success qualifies him to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey.“I had great timing. I got out,” after seven years, he told the network on Tuesday. “I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what I‘m supposed to do. I‘m a businessperson.”",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN10D1M3,

John McCain on Friday, moving to mend an intra-party rift that has put the Republican presidential nominee at odds with its highest-ranking elected official.Trump's endorsements came at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin.We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory. And very importantly, toward real change, Trump said, reading off a prepared statement. So in our shared mission, to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.Trump earlier in the week had declined to endorse Ryan and McCain, as well as New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election, said Trump, before backing Ayotte.The real estate mogul's campaign immediately sent out a list-building email to supporters, writing, It's time to unite our Party and deny a third term of Obama. I have officially endorsed Paul Ryan -- and together, we will fight for YOU, and together we will Make America Great Again!Trump's endorsements came more than 10 minutes after he began reading his statement, cutting in several times to offer tangential remarks -- from again rehashing an incident involving a crying baby at a recent rally to touting the strength of his fundraising.Trump heavily emphasized his outsider status in the lead-up to delivering his endorsements of three incumbent Republicans with a combined tenure in Congress of more than a half century.It's time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders and to replace it with a government that serves the people, Trump said.But then, Trump pointed out that he owes his success to his ability to put together a really fantastic team and stressed that he would need a Republican House and Senate to accomplish his agenda as president.And while he did not shy away from the disagreements he has had with Ryan, McCain and Ayotte -- all of whom have not hesitated to criticize Trump at times -- the Republican nominee leaned on a GOP icon to massage his endorsement.My 80% friend is not my 20% enemy, Trump said, quoting President Ronald Reagan. We are going to be the big tent party.The move comes just days ahead of Ryan's Tuesday primary matchup with challenger Paul Nehlen, who had played up Trump's refusal to back the speaker -- as well as Ryan's tepid support for Trump.It's not clear that Ryan is keen to receive Trump's endorsement. He repeatedly told Wisconsin radio stations in recent days that he's only seeking endorsements from the voters in his district, and a Ryan aide said he hadn't received word as of early Friday afternoon of Trump's plans.After the endorsement, another Ryan aide said the speaker appreciates the gesture and is going to continue to focus on earning the endorsement of the voters in Southern Wisconsin.Nehlen, who was at the rally, told CNN Friday night that Trump's endorsement was for party unity and not a statement of support for Ryan's policies.Mr. Trump did this for party unity and I applaud him for that, Nehlen said. That is the mark of a true leader.Nehlen insisted it wasn't awkward to stand in a sea of people cheering and applauding as Trump announced his endorsement of the House speaker.I fully expected it, said Nehlen, who added that he did not speak with or meet with Trump in recent days beyond their public exchange on Twitter.'I'm not quite there yet'I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country. We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet, Trump said in the Post interview.I strongly support Paul Ryan, strongly endorse his re-election, Pence, a longtime congressional colleague of Ryan's, said in a phone interview with Fox News. He is a longtime friend. He's a strong conservative leader. I believe we need Paul Ryan in leadership in the Congress of the United States.Ryan told WTMJ's Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin talk radio host, on Friday morning that he hadn't spoken with Trump since the Republican convention ended last month.Ryan, who withheld his own endorsement of Trump for weeks after Trump had clinched the party's nomination, deflected Sykes' questions about whether he might withdraw that support.I'm not going to get into any hypotheticals, he said. I see no purpose in doing this tit for tat petty back and forth with Donald Trump cause it serves no good purpose in my mind.Ryan had dismissed the importance of a Trump endorsement Friday morning in another local radio interview with WISN's Jay Weber.I'm not going to try and psychoanalyze this stuff, the House speaker told Weber. Honestly, the endorsement, personally the ones that I care about, are the ones from the people here in Wisconsin, my first congressional district employers. So you know I'm just going to rise above this stuff, and I'm not going to get involved in some sort of petty back and forth, I see no purpose in doing that.",http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/05/politics/donald-trump-endorse-paul-ryan/index.html,

Ryan, the nation’s highest-ranking elected Republican, said Thursday that he was “not ready” to endorse Donald J. Trump for president.",Paul Ryan Says He Is ‘Not Ready’ to Endorse Donald Trump,"“Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people,” he said. “They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!”Mr. Ryan, who made his remarks in an interview with CNN, said Republicans want “a standard-bearer that bears our standards.”“I think conservatives want to know: Does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?” he said. “There’s a lot of questions that conservatives, I think, are going to want answers to.”Mr. Ryan’s ambivalence toward Mr. Trump adds another layer of division in a party torn by the billionaire developer’s ascent, placing him at odds with his fellow Wisconsinite, Reince Priebus, the party chairman, who pronounced Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee and said Republicans should fall in line. Mr. Priebus was not aware Mr. Ryan was going to make the statement, his spokesman, Sean Spicer, told CNN.Although Mr. Ryan said he had expected the race to run at least a few more weeks, he had spent the last day honing his position, aides said, even as others, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, voiced unequivocal if not effusive support for Mr. Trump. While Mr. Ryan’s defiance put him in line with a number of other prominent Republicans, Mr. Trump has defied convention throughout the campaign, so the long-term effect was at best uncertain.In a campaign that has delivered a daily dose of head-shaking moments of awe, Mr. Trump on Thursday continued the trend, in a manner that made some Republicans cringe. In honor of Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Trump posted a photo on Twitter of himself digging into a taco bowl — made in the Trump Tower food court, of course — and included in the caption “I love Hispanics.”A party nominee has never failed to gain the support of a House speaker or majority leader from his party in modern times. In 1896, Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed ran against William McKinley and made it be known he would not serve as vice president, but ended up backing the nominee.In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater had to wait a bit uncomfortably for the endorsement of Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, but Mr. Dirksen gave it and thus ended the stop-Goldwater movement.While Mr. Ryan’s remarks caught Republicans off guard, it also gave them essentially a permission slip to go their own way on Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Had Mr. Ryan issued a forceful endorsement, it would have put pressure on fellow House Republicans to follow his lead, a step many have been unwilling to take.“I’m not there right now,” Mr. Ryan said. “And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party, and I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.”Mr. Trump, who once said Mr. Ryan would “pay a big price” if he did not support him, knows that the speaker and other opponents did not have great sway over primary voters. But Mr. Ryan, who has helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Republicans, may well be a more notable voice in a general election.Outside of Mr. Trump’s remarks about Muslims, Hispanic immigrants, women and other groups — which Mr. Ryan has at times gone out of his way to denounce — his policy positions on many major issues, notably trade and entitlements, stand in stark contrast with Mr. Ryan’s.Mr. Ryan has been signaling a willingness to carve out some terrain to differentiate himself by insisting that House Republicans write their own policy agenda this year, and he has left bread crumbs of ambivalence for months by giving speeches that at times criticized Mr. Trump’s views.After Mr. Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, Mr. Ryan strongly disagreed. “This is not conservatism,” Mr. Ryan said in December. “What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for, and more important, it’s not what this country stands for.”He also criticized Mr. Trump for declining to distance himself from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. “If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,” Mr. Ryan told reporters in early March.“This is fundamental,” Mr. Ryan added at the time. “And if someone wants to be our nominee, they must understand this. I hope this is the last time I need to speak out on this race.”While saying Thursday that “I don’t want to underplay” what Mr. Trump accomplished, Mr. Ryan picked up on those earlier themes, adding, “We hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln and Reaganesque,” someone who “appeals to a wide, vast majority of Americans.”Mr. Trump is expected to be a drag on some Republican candidates running for the House and Senate this November, given his intense unpopularity with key voting groups, including women, Hispanics and voters with college degrees.Even before Mr. Ryan spoke out, Mr. Trump was confronting the prospect of crippling defections within the Republican elite. Both George Bush and George W. Bush, the only two living former Republican presidents, announced on Wednesday that they would not back his candidacy.Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network, a conservative outside spending group, said Mr. Ryan had effectively cleared the way for others in the party to decide for themselves how to handle Mr. Trump. Mr. Shields said that with Mr. Ryan as an example, many candidates could cleave to a message and an issue agenda distinct from Mr. Trump’s.“This is something that every Republican can say at the local level,” Mr. Shields said. “It’s great leadership on Paul Ryan’s part, because it puts them in a place where all these other members can turn around and say the same thing, which is, ‘Look, there are some things that we’ve got to stand for.’ ”In exit polls, big chunks of the Republican electorate said they remained deeply wary of Mr. Trump. In Indiana, the state where he effectively locked up the Republican nomination, about a quarter of Republican voters said they would be scared to see him as the president.Mr. Ryan alluded Thursday to the broad stakes for his party. “I just think you always run like everything is on the line. My focus this fall is, has been and will be the House majority,” Mr. Ryan said. He added, “But I also really love this country, and I want to see us win this election.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/us/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump.html,

Per news reports, Ryan is now trying to distance himself from his party’s presidential nominee but is still standing by his plan to vote for Trump.According to CNN, Ryan gave his blessing to House Republicans to either ditch Trump or to stay behind the GOP candidate, saying “you all need to do what’s best for you and your district.” It sounds as if Ryan has essentially given up hope that Republicans can defeat Hillary Clinton and win back the White House.Ryan has expressed general discomfort with Trump throughout the campaign. After Trump went off against an Indiana judge, saying the judge’s Mexican heritage made him unfit to oversee a case against Trump University, Ryan called Trump’s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” Yet Trump was Ryan’s racist, and the House Speaker campaigned for the GOP nominee.

Ron Johnson, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. That event, which was to be called “Wisconsin Fall Fest,” will no longer feature the Republican presidential candidate after the release of a 2005 tape in which he is heard seeming to describe sexually assaulting women.Ryan responded to those comments by announcing that Trump would not be in attendance and saying that Trump’s remarks “sickened” him.Here’s the thing, though: The rest of that statement implies that even after Trump described how he would “grab [women] by the pussy,” Trump still was not going to lose Ryan’s endorsement.Since Trump claimed enough delegates to knock out his primary rivals and secure the GOP nomination in May, Ryan’s repeated denunciations of Trump have always fallen well short of renouncing his candidacy.Immediately after Trump clinched the nod, Ryan said he was “just not ready” to endorse the billionaire walking grotesquery. As I wrote at the time, Ryan’s statement of doubt was so full of caveats that it seemed obvious he would eventually endorse, which he did less than a month later.Ryan has repeatedly said that his support of Trump is not a “blank check,” but he has never said where exactly he would draw the line, which suggests that check might as well be for a trillion dollars. When Trump said an American judge of Mexican heritage was not fit to adjudicate the Trump University lawsuit because of his ethnicity, Ryan acknowledged that was a case of “textbook racism.” But he explicitly refused to revoke his endorsement. When Trump feuded with the family of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, Ryan sided with the Khans against Trump. He did not take back his endorsement, though, and didn’t even hint at it.Maybe Friday’s video will prove to be the final straw, with revelations that a man who has been publicly accused of committing sexual assault had privately appeared to brag about committing sexual assault forcing Ryan's hand. Maybe he won’t have a choice but to finally say enough is enough.But if you look at the statement he released Friday, Ryan is giving himself plenty of room not to back out now. “I hope that Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves” Ryan says, meaning that if Trump says anything about it that Ryan can point to as “serious,” then he will have nothing to worry about from the Speaker.",http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/pual_ryan_sickened_by_donald_trump_still_supports_donald_trump.html,

And on Monday, he told members of his caucus that he was pulling back everything except his endorsement of Trump’s candidacy.Republican members, only willing to discuss their perceptions without their names attached, said Ryan’s announcement to them on a conference call on Monday that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump was tantamount to pulling his endorsement. At least, that’s the way it would be seen in their districts, the members said.Trump, of course, regarded Ryan’s one-foot-in, one-foot-out support as an act of aggression. The GOP nominee spent Monday and Tuesday repeatedly going after the speaker, even at the risk of turning off Republican voters in the election. Elected Republicans now look apt to go to war after the election, if not before.Some of that rancor will depend on whether Trump is in a position to continue attacking Ryan and other Republicans. His hand weakens with new disclosures, including Wednesday’s New York Times report that Trump sexually assaulted two women, as well as a CBS story saying Trump looked at a 10-year-old girl in 1992 and said, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years.”These members said their impression from talking to GOP colleagues was that their conference would be better off if Ryan had never made such a big deal about his support for Trump. They added that GOP leaders could have handled Monday’s conference call better.One member pointed out that when leaders need to break bad news to the conference, they usually call a meeting, present a plan and have establishment allies line up behind the microphones to flood the conference with positive feedback. “It’s a running joke in the conference,” one member said.That position may have less to do with Trump than with Bridenstine’s opposition to Ryan. Bridenstine twice voted against Ryan’s predecessor as speaker, former Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), though he did support Ryan almost exactly a year ago during his speaker election.Members also suggested that Bridenstine’s a smart enough tactician to see an opening on Ryan and take it, even if that meant aligning himself with Trump. (Bridenstine was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) presidential campaign, writing a Breitbart op-ed in July 2015.)Even if Bridenstine is just using Ryan’s posturing on Trump for his own ends, he instantly worsens the climate for the speaker in many conservative districts, where supporting Ryan could become a litmus test, especially if Trump jumps on the issue after the election and right-wing media casts Ryan as the enemy.If Ryan had refused to endorse Trump, it’s almost certain that the thin-skinned nominee would have been calling on Ryan to resign. And if he had blindly followed Trump without standing up to him at all, he would have cast Republicans as no better than Trump. (There’s an argument that they should be cast that way anyway.)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-endorsement-donald-trump_us_57fe9a84e4b05eff55814419,

Well, we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class.Wait what? the videos continues, before playing the damning sentence in slow motion: We are going to raise taxes on the middle class.Wait, what? was the reaction of the Clinton campaign too. Spokesman Josh Schwerin told us Clinton actually said the exact opposite.He pointed to numerous reporters who agreed and forwarded us a transcript of Clinton’s prepared remarks that reads, We aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class.It’s a classic case of she-heard-he-heard, so we asked experts to arbitrate. They agreed with the Clinton camp and offered some technical evidence to prove it. Get ready for some science.Alan Yu, a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in phonology, ran the audio through a computer program called Praat, which analyzes phonetics.By analyzing the sound waves, we can see that Clinton was saying aren’t, because she definitely pronounced the n, though she didn’t really hit the t.As you can see, the phoneme (unit of sound) highlighted in pink is an n, though there’s not a t. That still suggests she was trying for the word aren’t.It is pretty common for people to not release the final ‘t in word-final -nt clusters and is definitely not likely for someone to release the ‘t’in a three-consonant sequence like ‘ntg’ in ‘aren't going,’ Yu told us. In any case, since she did pronounce the ‘n’ in ‘aren't’, it is clear that she produced the negated form of the copula ‘are.’Edward Flemming, a linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also ran the audio through Praat and came up with the same results. But even if we didn’t have Praat, he said, context alone sways the argument in the Clinton camp’s favor.Also if she was going to say ‘we are going to’, wouldn’t she contract it to ‘we’re’, as she does a few words earlier? Flemming pointed out. To my ears, it is clear that she is saying ‘aren’t’.Clinton’s tax plan, by the way, does not change the tax rates for the middle class and instead targets the wealthy through small reforms.The Trump campaign said, Hillary Clinton says  she wants to, ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’ According to the transcript, numerous reporters, experts and a computer program, Clinton said the exact opposite.We rate this statement Pants on Fire!",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-wants-ra/,

Joined by left-wing Democrat billionaire Warren Buffett, she received applause from those in attendance. “Because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super-rich,” said Clinton. “Well, we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you, right now — we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!”Social media users sharing this video offered it as evidence that Clinton had actually promised to raise taxes on “the middle class but not the rich,” that she had changed her tax platform, and/or that she had let loose with a Freudian slip and accidentally revealed the truth of what she was really thinking.Some viewers defended Clinton by saying that the clip had been edited, but it was not. The footage was taken from a speech Clinton delivered during a campaign stop in Omaha, Nebraska, on 1 August 2016:Given the context of her statement and the audience’s positive reaction to it, it appears that Clinton actually said “we aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class,” but either she didn’t fully enunciate the ending of the word “aren’t” or the word didn’t come through clearly on the audio recording (or both). Worst case, she simply misspoke and said “are” when she meant “aren’t,” because she has not announced any changes to her tax platform or said on any other occasion that she plans to raise taxes on the middle class and not the wealthy.Shortly before the portion of her speech captured in the viral video, Clinton said that raising taxes on the wealthy would serve as the foundation for future investments:“We’re going to use [Warren Buffett] and his ideas about how we’re going to tax the wealthy more as the real foundation of making the investments in America that will help everybody. I’m told that Donald Trump stays glued to the TV set so I hope he heard Warren. You know, there’s always time for a conversion. Because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich. Well, we’re not going there my friends …”That platform of closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and providing tax relief to working families is also outlined on her campaign web site:Restore basic fairness to our tax code. Hillary will implement a “fair share surcharge” on multi-millionaires and billionaires and fight for measures like the Buffett Rule to ensure the wealthiest Americans do not pay a lower tax rate than hardworking middle-class families. She’ll close loopholes that create a private tax system for the most fortunate, and she’ll ensure multi-million-dollar estates are paying their fair share of taxes. Provide tax relief to working families from the rising costs they face. For too many years, middle-class families have been squeezed by rising costs for everything from child care to health care to affording college. Hillary will offer relief from these rising costs, including tax relief for Americans facing excessive out-of-pocket health care costs and for those caring for an ill or elderly family member.A transcript of Clinton’s speech stated that she said “we aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class.”",https://www.snopes.com/2016/08/04/hillary-clinton-raise-taxes/,

What she isn't saying is that every time Washington raises taxes on the ""rich,"" the middle class take a hit, too.","Hillary Will Raise Taxes On The Middle Class, Just Like Bill Did","Revenue: Hillary Clinton says she can pay for her ambitious spending program by only taxing those making more than $250,000. What she isn't saying is that every time Washington raises taxes on the rich, the middle class take a hit, too.Anyone who thinks Hillary will live up to her promise should look at what her husband was saying 24 years ago. Like Hillary today, Bill said he'd make the rich pay their fair share, meaning those making more than $200,000 a year. Middle class families would get a tax cut.Just weeks after setting foot in the White House, Bill abandoned that pledge. In a Feb. 15, 1992, Oval Office address, Clinton said: We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow.President Obama made the same promise in 2008. I can make a firm pledge, he said shortly before the election, under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.Obama's pledge turned out to be just as reliable as Bill's.For daily updates on the presidential race, including the latest tracking poll information and demographic breakdowns of results, follow the IBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll.Within three months Obama signed a law that hiked the notoriously regressive tobacco tax by 150%, prompting the AP to declare Obama tax pledge up in smoke.Less than a year later, he signed ObamaCare into law, which hit the middle class with several new taxes — including the individual mandate tax, limits on various medical tax deductions, a fee on every health plan, and others.What's more, Hillary's pledge isn't a pledge at all, just a goal.When ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asked her last December, Is that a rock-solid promise? Clinton said, Well, it certainly is my goal. Given her massive spending plans, that's a goal she'll quickly abandon.The broader history of tax hikes makes it clear, too, that whenever politicians talk up tax hikes on the rich, the middle class get burned.The original income tax passed in 1913 imposed a 1% tax on incomes below $463,000 (in inflation-adjusted terms), according to the Tax Foundation. The top rate, which applied to incomes over $11 million, was 7%.Within five years, the top rate for these multimillionaires was 77%. But families making as little as $60,000 (in today's dollars) faced a 6% income tax.By 1944, the rich were really getting soaked, with income above $2.6 million facing a 94% tax rate. But the tax burden on the middle class leapt upward as well, with families making as little as $26,000 paying 23%.History shows that the opposite is also true. When taxes get cut for the rich, the middle class sees its taxes go down as well. That's what happened under the JFK, Reagan and Bush tax cuts, and would happen under a Trump tax cut.So next time Hillary says she'll spare the middle class, consider the fact that going where the money is by definition means going after the middle class families. Because that's where most of the money actually is.If You Liked Obamanomics, You'll Love Hillarynomics",http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/hillary-will-raise-taxes-on-the-middle-class-just-like-bill-did/,

Many high-income families benefit from large deductions for things like home mortgage interest and state income tax. Many of these families also have a substantial portion of their income from long-term capital gains, usually taxed at 23.8 percent.What Mr. Trump would do: He would cut the top marginal income tax rate to 33 percent. An analysis by the Tax Foundation of the House Republicans’ tax plan, on which Mr. Trump’s is based, found it would increase after-tax income for the richest 1 percent by 5.3 percent.Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent — and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into “pass-through” business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details.For example, an executive who is paid $1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to “sell” $1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent.What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over $1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low long-term capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent.Current: For a married couple making between $18,551 and $75,300, the official marginal tax rate is 15 percent. But in practice, about 45 percent of American taxpayers pay no individual income tax (they do pay federal payroll taxes), because of various tax credits that particularly favor families with children.What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to lower taxes across the board in line with a proposal earlier in the year by House Republicans, which reduced the 15 percent income tax bracket to 12 percent. The Tax Foundation estimated that plan would raise after-tax income for families in the 20th-to-40th percentiles by 0.5 percent, and for middle-income taxpayers by 0.2 percent.Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details.What Mrs. Clinton would do: Americans in the bottom 95 percent of income would see little or no change to their taxes under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis.She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don’t pay federal income tax.Current: When a person dies, the first $5.45 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, $10.9 million for a married couple. Assets above those levels are generally taxed at 40 percent before being passed on to heirs.What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to eliminate the estate tax, or the “death tax” as he and other Republicans refer to it, allowing even the wealthiest people to pass along their assets to heirs without being taxed.What Mrs. Clinton would do: She would lower the levels of exemptions to $3.5 million for individuals and $7 million for a couple. More families would have to pay, and very wealthy families would pay taxes on a higher portion of their assets. She would also increase the tax rate on affected estates to 45 percent.Current: It’s complicated. The official corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, higher than for most advanced countries. But the United States also offers a complex range of deductions that mean the effective rate — what is actually collected by the government — is much lower. If that combination of a high rate but low tax collections doesn’t sound very good, congratulations: Tax writers in both political parties agree with you.What Mr. Trump would do: He would sharply cut the top tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent. And he would apply that rate to partnerships and other types of businesses that currently pass their profits on to individuals who then are taxed at individual income rates as high as 39.6 percent. He would simultaneously eliminate a wide range of business deductions.With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home.The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation’s estimate.What Mrs. Clinton would do: She seeks a series of tweaks to the corporate tax code to try to dissuade companies from moving operations abroad to save on taxes.One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute “tax inversions,” in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner’s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an “exit tax” on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad.Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes.Current: The United States is on track to have a budget deficit of $534 billion in the current fiscal year and a total of $9.3 trillion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would gradually push the total debt relative to the economy to 86 percent from about 75 percent.What Mr. Trump would do: He just overhauled his tax plan on Monday, and there aren’t detailed estimates available yet. But his earlier plan was estimated to reduce federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. If not offset by either huge spending cuts or a major burst in economic growth, that would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, even before accounting for potentially higher interest rates as a result. His new proposal would probably reduce tax revenues by less than his original did, though exactly how much has not been fully modeled.What Mrs. Clinton would do: Her tax proposals are estimated to increase federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over the decade. She has said she would use that increased revenue to cover the cost of other policy proposals, with the intention of making her overall agenda have a neutral effect on the budget deficit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/upshot/how-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-differ-on-taxes.html,

The change, together with two other new tax proposals, would generate $260 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Clinton’s new plan not only has a top tax rate not seen since 1981, but also introduces three new tax brackets: a 50% rate for estates valued at more than $10 million per person, 55% for estates of more than $50 million, and 65% for estates exceeding $500 million.Read Next: How Many People Actually Pay the Estate Tax?That’s a big departure from the current top tax rate of 40%, and her rival, Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax all together.Despite Clinton’s own proposals, she and husband Bill have created property and insurance trusts as a tax strategy to ensure that, after they die, at least some of their millions of dollars in assets will be shielded from the estate tax. A move Trump’s campaign called “hypocritical.” Read More: Hillary Clinton Has Managed Her Estate the Way She Does Everything ElseIncreased estate taxes aren’t the only major change Clinton wants. The plan would also repeal a feature of the tax code known as the “step-up basis” that dramatically reduces capital gains tax bills heirs pay after inheriting valuable assets.Typically, investors pay capital gains tax on the profit they reap whenever they sell an asset that has appreciated in value. But assets can be passed onto heirs with out paying tax on the appreciation. If and when heirs sell, they do pay the tax. But the size of the heirs’ profits is calculated based on the value of the assets at the time the heirs inherited them, not when they were originally bought by the heirs’ ancestor.Under Clinton’s plan, investors, or rather their estate, would owe the tax when they passed away, according the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. There are some exceptions though exactly what they are is not clear. The campaign did support a variety of exemptions “to prevent the tax from applying to taxpayers making less than $250,000 and to limit its impact on various non-financial assets such as farms, businesses, and real estate,” the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in a statement. Such a change would generate an estimated $150 billion in revenue.Clinton’s final plan change would limit like-kind exchanges, which is a feature of the tax code real estate investors commonly use to defer capital gains taxes.In total, Clinton’s tax code reforms would raise taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, boosting overall tax receipts by about 4%.

We're not going to be fooled. We're going to get back to real tax relief for middle-class families. I'll extend the middle-class tax cuts, give generous tax breaks to help families afford health care, offer up to $1,000 in matching tax cuts to help families save for retirement.

I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class.”",Trump Campaign Circulates Misleading Video Claiming Clinton Promised To Raise Taxes On Middle Class,"On Thursday, Republican nominee Donald Trump’s presidential campaign released a video in which it claimed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton “vows to raise taxes on the middle class.”“Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich,” Clinton starts out saying to loud boos. “Well, we’re not going there my friends. I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class.”The next line is the one the Trump campaign claims is her promise to raise taxes on the middle class. But the audio isn’t clear enough to determine whether she says “We aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class” or “We are.” Watch Trump’s video:Watch the full speech (relevant section begins at about 28:00):Just before the clip that Trump pulled out, Clinton was talking about the “loopholes and special breaks” in the tax code that benefit the rich and worsen income inequality. She brought up the so-called “Buffett rule,” which she says means a wealthy man like Warren Buffett shouldn’t pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. She also promised to tax the wealthy more and use the money to invest in her priorities.No matter what she may have said at the event in Omaha, Nebraska earlier this week, Clinton has consistently promised not to raise taxes on the middle class. She has pledged that those who make less than $250,000 won’t see a tax increase over and over and over again.Clinton has backed those promises up with a detailed tax plan. The conservative Tax Foundation found in its analysis that her proposal would only raise taxes on the the wealthiest 10 percent of the country without raising them on the middle class, while the centrist Tax Policy Center found her plan would very modestly increase taxes on the middle of the income distribution, by $60 over a decade, while the wealthiest fifth of the country would pay $6,739 more. Moody’s Analytics concluded that taken together, Clinton’s economic proposals would increase incomes for the poor and middle class.Trump’s plan looks very different. While all income levels would get a tax break under his plan, the richest get by far the largest benefit: according to the Tax Policy Center, the top fifth would be more than $32,000 richer, while the top one percent would get a $1.78 million boost.Meanwhile, advisers to Trump have said they will at some point release a revamped tax proposal that doesn’t cost the government quite as much revenue, and they have proposed raising rates on the middle class. Moody’s found that the average American household would actually see its income stay flat over his presidency thanks to the detrimental effects of his other economic proposals, such as undoing trade deals and deporting immigrants.",https://thinkprogress.org/trump-campaign-circulates-misleading-video-claiming-clinton-promised-to-raise-taxes-on-middle-class-766c199cdcdc/,

Linguistics professors at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted soundwave analyses for PolitiFact. These tests proved that Clinton said, “ . . . we aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class.” (Emphasis added.) However, she pronounced the “t” almost inaudibly, leading to several days of erroneous accusations and subsequent apologies for these unwittingly inaccurate reports and op-ed pieces, mine among them.This particular story was wrong. However, as the campus Left might say, it nonetheless highlighted a broader truth.If Clinton reportedly had said, “I plan to dismantle Roe v. Wade,” everyone would know instantly that this was either fake news, or Clinton had a much bigger problem, namely a complete and total short circuit inside her head.An eventually inoperative story about Clinton’s envisioning a middle-class tax hike endured for days because she, her running mate, and the man she hopes to succeed all have advocated or enacted middle-class tax hikes — even as America is mired in the economic doldrums.There is never a good time to raise taxes on the middle class, but now is especially bad. America’s economy grew at just 1 percent for the first half of 2016. President Obama’s recovery is the worst since 1949, according to the Wall Street Journal. Today’s barely measurable expansion is the weakest in 67 years.Real median household incomes have slipped under Obama, from $54,925 when he was inaugurated in January 2009 to $53,657 in 2014. The latest Census Bureau data confirm this 2.3 percent slide.This situation is so dire that life expectancy has fallen among white women, from 81.2 years to 81.1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why this abnormal decline? One theory is that — starved for hope and opportunity in a moribund economy — some white females have surrendered to alcohol, drugs, and suicide.Clinton has said she would not boost taxes on anyone earning less than $250,000. But when ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos asked her last December, “Is that a rock-solid promise?” Clinton balked. “Well,” she said, “it certainly is my goal.”Indeed, Clinton has proposed or embraced several new middle-class taxes:Clinton has favored a 25 percent national sales tax on guns since 1993.Asked in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 11 if she would veto a payroll-tax hike on every American, Clinton replied: “No, no.”Clinton told Philadelphia voters in April, “I’m very supportive of the mayor’s proposal to tax soda to get universal preschool for kids.”“Frankly,” Senator Bernie Sanders responded, “I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000.”Clinton also is open to a tax on carbon dioxide, which would boost price tags across the economy and asphyxiate employment prospects for those looking for work and hoping to keep their jobs.“Right now we’ve not proposed a carbon tax,” Clinton campaign chief John Podesta told journalists on July 26. “But if Congress wants to come forward with one, we’ll take a look at it.”Meanwhile, Democrat vice-presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia wanted to take things even further. As governor, High-Tax Tim advocated higher levies on those who aspired to the middle class. He sought to increase his state’s bottom tax rate from 5.75 percent to 6.75 percent. This would have socked families with annual incomes as low as $17,000. Kaine also fought for a 60-cent-per-pack jump in the state cigarette tax and a 2 percent bump in distilled-spirit prices among Virginia’s government-monopoly liquor stores.RELATED: The Rise of the ‘Safe Socialists’Clinton-Kaine’s support for middle-class tax hikes would resemble such tax increases under Obama.Obama told a joint session of Congress in February 2009, “If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: Not one single dime.”Obama’s promise proved to be yet another lie.Also, when Obama hiked cigarette taxes in April 2009, an Associated Press story declared: “Obama Tax Pledge Up in Smoke.”Bottom line: Democrats love tax revenue more than they love the middle class.— Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor with National Review Online.",http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438788/hillary-clintons-tax-plan-middle-class-tax-hikes,

Right now, neither candidate is proposing major tax changes.Tax policy is one of the issues on which the two nominees differ most. Their approaches are likely to draw new attention in the wake of a New York Times report that Trump's nearly $916 million in losses in 1995, according to tax records the paper received anonymously, means he may not have paid federal income taxes for as many as 18 years.On trade, Clinton has backed off her previous support for free trade agreements and, like Trump, now opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact involving the U.S. and 11 other nations.Trump has said he will spend twice as much on building and repairing roads, airports and other infrastructure as Clinton would.On trade and infrastructure spending, Trump has taken a populist approach that jettisons Republican orthodoxy. But on taxes, his proposed tax cuts for individuals and businesses are more in line with previous Republican candidates and elected officials. After two previous tries, he provided more details on his tax plans in a speech in New York last week — although he left one key component unclear.Clinton, for her part, is proposing to raise taxes for the wealthiest households to pay for traditional Democratic proposals such as expanding access to higher education.Here, at least, they fall into very much traditional Democratic and Republican proposals, said William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute.On taxes, the two candidates remain far apart. Here are summaries of their proposals:",http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/03/how-the-trump-and-clinton-tax-plans-would-affect-americans.html,

Three times during the proceedings, Clinton asserted that her economic proposals—which call for about $1.65 trillion in additional spending over the next ten years on infrastructure, health care, education, and other items in the federal budget—wouldn’t “add a penny” to the national debt.Clinton’s words prompted some  dismissive scoffs  from conservative observers, and they sent me searching for independent analyses of her plans. Fortunately, there are at least three of them, and they all indicate that while Clinton is probably exaggerating when she says she won’t “add a penny” to the debt, her campaign has, in fact, gone to great lengths to find ways to pay for her proposals. Most notably, Clinton has proposed a series of tax hikes on the ultra-rich. If all these tax increases were enacted, her economic plan may still increase the national debt, but only by about twenty billion dollars a year—a small fraction of the over-all level of debt, which is about $19.7 trillion.Where Clinton’s plan would have a big impact is on the after-tax incomes of many of the richest people in the country. Here are some numbers from  a newly updated analysis by the Tax Policy Center , a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute:•   About ninety-two per cent of the Clinton tax increase would fall on the richest one per cent of the population—people who earn at least $699,000 a year.•   These high earners would face, on average, a tax increase of $117,760. They would see their after-tax incomes reduced by 7.4 per cent.•   Nearly two-thirds of the Clinton tax increase would fall on the richest 0.1 per cent of the population—people with annual incomes greater than $3.75 million.•   These ultra-high earners would face, on average, a tax increase of about $800,000. They would see their after-tax incomes reduced by 10.8 per cent.Clinton has made no secret of her intention to raise taxes on the rich. Understandably, she has spent little time laying out the details of the increases she is proposing. If she spelled out how much more money the wealthy would be paying to the U.S. Treasury under a Clinton Administration, some of her well-heeled donors might have second thoughts. In any case, there are five main ways in which the Clinton tax plan would hit the very rich:It would limit the amount of tax relief that high-income taxpayers can get from itemized deductions, such as mortgage-interest payments, state and local taxes, and contributions to pension plans. Since people who earn millions of dollars a year tend to arrange their finances so that they are eligible for a lot of deductions, this proposal would have a substantial impact on their tax liabilities. It would enact a version of the “Buffett Rule,” named for Warren Buffett, which states that no household making more than a million dollars a year should pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than middle-class families do. Specifically, Clinton would make wealthy households pay at least thirty per cent of their income in federal taxes, with the provision being phased in so that it doesn’t take full effect until incomes top $2 million. It would impose a new four-per-cent tax surcharge on all households with taxable incomes of more than five million dollars (or $2.5 million for married couples who file separate returns). For many ultra-rich households, this would make their top marginal tax rate 47.4 per cent. The current top rate of income tax is 39.6 per cent. The Affordable Care Act introduced a 3.8-per-cent “Obamacare tax” on investment income. Add Clinton’s proposed four-per-cent surcharge on top of that and you get to 47.4 per cent. That’s much lower than the top rate in the Eisenhower era, which was more than ninety per cent, but it’s much higher than the top rate at the end of the Reagan era, which was twenty-eight per cent. It would broaden the base for the Obamacare tax on investment income, which applies to taxpayers with over-all incomes of more than $200,000 a year. At the moment, some so-called pass-through income, which rich people earn from investment partnerships and other sources, escapes the Obamacare tax. Clinton’s plan would close this loophole. It would expand the estate tax in three significant ways. First, the tax would apply to all bequests larger than $3.5 million ($7 million for married couples), whereas the current system exempts bequests up to $5.45 million ($10.9 million per married couple). In addition, Clinton would eliminate the “step-up in basis” loophole, which allows heirs to avoid paying capital gains tax on assets that have appreciated in value under the ownership of the deceased. And, third, Clinton recently  adopted a proposal  from Bernie Sanders to impose higher tax rates on very large bequests. Right now, the estate tax rate is forty per cent, no matter the size of the bequest. Clinton wants to introduce a graduated rate, which would start at forty-five per cent and rise to sixty-five per cent for estates worth more than $500 million (or a billion dollars for a married couple).How did a candidate who describes herself, at least in her  paid speeches to bankers and corporations , as a moderate pragmatist get to the stage where she has adopted an estate-tax proposal that Sanders supporters should love, and that the editorial board of the _Wall Street Journal _ lambasted  as “Clinton’s 65% Killer Death Tax”? For one thing, she boxed herself in. From the beginning of her campaign, Clinton has followed the playbook that President Obama used in 2008, promising that any household earning less than $250,000 a year won’t face any tax increases. Designed to inoculate Democratic candidates against Republican efforts to portray them as inveterate tax raisers, this pledge means that about ninety-seven per cent of American taxpayers can sleep soundly in the knowledge that a Clinton Administration won’t hit them up them as sources of additional revenue. But as Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, pointed out to me, the pledge also implies something else: “If you want to raise a good amount of revenue”—as Clinton does—“you’ve got to hit the rich pretty hard.”Taken together, the five tax hikes on the rich would bring in about $1.1 trillion over ten years, according to  a recently updated analysis  by the Tax Foundation, an independent research group. The foundation also estimates that higher corporate income taxes and payroll taxes would raise another $300 billion, bringing total new revenues to $1.4 trillion. The Tax Policy Center agrees with these figures. A third independent watchdog, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has produced a slightly higher total revenue figure:  $1.5 trillion . That’s not too far short of the $1.65 trillion estimate for the over-all cost of Clinton’s spending plans, which came from the same organization. (I should point out that these tax-revenue figures are static, or first-round, estimates. Two of the analyses also reported so-called dynamic estimates, which seek to take into account behavioral changes, such as changes in hours worked, that the reforms might spark. Since economists can't agree on how these dynamic estimates should be constructed, I've relied on the static estimates, which have the virtues of being comparable, simpler, and pretty similar in size.)Political arithmetic, however, can’t fully explain Clinton's eagerness—or willingness, at least—to soak the rich. These proposals also reflect a broader leftward shift in the Democratic Party, and in the sort of policies it is willing to countenance. In a  recent essay  at Vox, Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute (and the author of the Rortybomb blog), pointed out that taking positive measures to tackle rising inequality is a central tenet of a “new liberal economics,” to which practically all Democrats now adhere.That includes the Obama Administration, especially the second-term version. Indeed, a number of Clinton’s proposals—the Buffett Rule, for one—were lifted straight from Obama’s recent budget proposals. Other Clinton ideas, such as the four-per-cent tax surcharge on people earning more than $5 million, are unique to her campaign, but they are rooted in the same desire to tilt the economic playing field away from the top one per cent, which in recent decades has captured  more than half of all income growth .Of course, many liberals and Democrats have long supported efforts to ameliorate inequality by raising taxes on the rich. What has changed is that politicians in the center of the party, such as Obama and Clinton, are now publicly rejecting the old argument that this has to be done lightly for fear of reducing the incentives to work hard and make capital investments, which, in turn, could crimp economic growth. Rather than being forced onto the defensive by conservative economic arguments, Democrats in 2016 are making the case that using the tax system fairly aggressively to counteract inequality and boosting G.D.P. can actually be complementary.“We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their share,” Clinton said during  last week’s debate . “And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We’ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We’ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That’s where growth will come from.”Assuming Clinton defeats Trump on November 8th, the results of the Senate and House elections will determine whether her tax plan serves as a starting point for negotiations with Republicans or as an actual blueprint for governing. Either way, though, it has laid down a significant marker.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-plan-to-squeeze-the-ultra-rich,

W. Bush and Ross Perot, Bill Clinton pledged to cut taxes for most Americans, while fighting the deficit.  Once he was in office, however, his plan changed almost entirely to deficit reduction.  In fact, President Clinton's 1993 budget was a massive tax increase (albeit one that contributed to the first surpluses in decades by the time he left office).  The backlash to that budget, along with a failed carbon tax and healthcare reform plan, propelled Republicans to seizing both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years.  Maybe Hillary Clinton would like to avoid repeating that mistake.  Perhaps she, probably accurately, sees that deficit reduction and new spending needs will trump any desire for broad tax relief and doesn't want to get caught up defending a flip-flop in 2018 and 2020.Another possibility, which isn't mutually exclusive from learning from her husband's experiences, is that Hillary Clinton simply isn't all that committed to tax relief.  Rifle-shot tax expenditures that sound good, but don't cost the government that much revenue, have always been among the Clintons' favorite political gambits.  Perhaps that's all Hillary thinks she needs to talk about to win over populists who were backing Sanders or who might be thinking of supporting Donald Trump.If that's the case, then Clinton owes it to voters to make it clear that no new plan is coming.  And voters who believe that actual tax relief is a key part of fighting inequality or increasing take-home income need to look elsewhere.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2016/09/26/hillary-clintons-phantom-tax-relief-plan/,

At a rally in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton made no bones about the fact that her tax platform centers on raising more revenue to pay for billions of dollars in new spending, including her plan to offer free college to virtually all Americans, make one of the largest investments in history in infrastructure, raise the national minimum wage and underwrite other progressive goals. Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, tried to contrast their approach with that of Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans. The Democratic duo painted Mr. Trump as a heartless businessman whose own tax plan would funnel more breaks to his wealthy friends and institute loopholes benefiting corporations, while leaving middle-class families out in the cold. The former first lady also vowed never to raise taxes on the middle class — a reversal from her time in the Senate, when she voted to hike taxes on Americans making just over $40,000 — but made clear the rich will be in her crosshairs if she makes it to the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton’s tax plan would raise taxes on Americans making over $250,000 per year, and she has said she would pursue new taxes on corporations and penalties for companies that move jobs abroad. “We are going to tax the wealthy who have made all of the income gains in the last 15 years: the superwealthy, the corporations, Wall Street. They’re going to have to invest in education, in skills training, in infrastructure, because we have to grow this economy. We do need to have the resources to do that,” she said. “I will not raise taxes on the middle class. The middle class has to catch up to where they were before the Great Recession.” Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump’s tax proposals would allow the rich to find new ways to avoid paying their share. “Under his plans, Donald Trump would pay a lower tax rate than middle-class families,” she said. Mrs. Clinton made just a passing mention to the latest shake-up inside the Trump campaign. She said the Republican billionaire’s platform and economic priorities will not change, no matter who gets hired or fired from his operation. Instead, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine, who was on the trail in the battleground state of Iowa, chose mostly to focus on policy. Mrs. Clinton promised, if she becomes president, to connect every home in the country to broadband internet, create millions of jobs by rebuilding infrastructure across the country, raise the national minimum wage, institute equal pay for women, make child care more affordable and provide debt-free college for most Americans. Mr. Kaine cast those priorities, especially the effort to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to at least $12 an hour, as a moral imperative. “If you work in this country for minimum wage, and a lot of people do, … and you have a dependent or two, you are below the poverty level,” he told a crowd at a community college in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “So what does that mean about what we say? We tell them, ‘Work is really important, we want you to work really hard, but we have policies that if you work hard you’re going to be below the poverty level.’” Mrs. Clinton echoed those sentiments, saying hardworking middle-class Americans need tax breaks and the wealthy, including herself, can and must pay more. “Donald Trump doesn’t need a tax cut. I don’t need a tax cut,” she said. Republicans fired back by saying Mrs. Clinton’s vow not to raise taxes on the middle class doesn’t square with her record in the Senate. The Republican National Committee released a fact sheet pointing to Mrs. Clinton’s votes in 2006 and 2007 to raise the capital gains tax on middle-class Americans and to raise taxes on Americans making over $164,550 a year. The RNC also pointed to Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 vote in favor of a budget resolution that would have raised taxes on individuals with salaries as low as $41,500. “Not only will Hillary Clinton’s tax plan kill jobs, reduce wages and hurt economic growth, her votes in the U.S. Senate to raise taxes on those making as little as $41,500 per year show she can’t be trusted to look out for the middle class,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-pushes-economic-plan-promises-rais/,
The Earth is not warming.,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/barry-smitherman/scientific-consensus-remains-planet-warming/,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Since 1978, global warming has become even more apparent. Over the last 30 years, Hansen’s analysis reveals that Earth warmed another 0.5°C, for a total warming of 0.9°C since 1880.",Earth's Temperature Tracker : Feature Articles,"In 1967 Hansen went to work for NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York City, where he continued his research on planetary problems. Around 1970, some scientists suspected Earth was entering a period of global cooling. Decades prior, the brilliant Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch had explained how our world warms and cools on roughly 100,000-year cycles due to its slowly changing position relative to the Sun. Milankovitch’s theory suggested Earth should be just beginning to head into its next ice age cycle. The surface temperature data gathered by Mitchell seemed to agree; the record showed that Earth experienced a period of cooling (by about 0.3°C) from 1940 through 1970. Of course, Mitchell was only collecting data over a fraction of the Northern Hemisphere—from 20 to 90 degrees North latitude. Still, the result drew public attention and a number of speculative articles about Earth’s coming ice age appeared in newspapers and magazines. The Data and the DetailsBut other scientists forecasted global warming. Russian climatologist Mikhail Budyko had also observed the three-decade cooling trend. Nevertheless, he published a paper in 1967 in which he predicted the cooling would soon switch to warming due to rising human emissions of carbon dioxide. Budyko’s paper and another paper published in 1975 by Veerabhadran Ramanathan caught Hansen’s attention. Ramanathan pointed out that human-made chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) are particularly potent greenhouse gases, with as much as 200 times the heat-retaining capacity of carbon dioxide. Because people were adding CFCs to the lower atmosphere at an increasing rate, Ramanathan expressed concern that these new gases would eventually add to Earth’s greenhouse effect and cause our world to warm. (Because CFCs also erode Earth’s protective ozone layer, their use was mostly abolished in 1989 with the signing of the Montreal Protocol.) The notion that humans could override nature and force the globe to warm intrigued Hansen. “It had been known for more than a century that increasing carbon dioxide could have an effect on global temperature,” Hansen said (referring to the pioneering work of John Tyndall and Svante Arrhenius in the 1800s). But global warming in the near future? That was another matter. Hansen returned his attention to the physics equations he’d played with almost 10 years earlier. Collaborating with Andy Lacis, a colleague at NASA, he built a simple climate model to simulate how changes in the atmosphere cause Earth’s average temperature to change over time. Hansen and Lacis tweaked the inputs to simulate the cumulative influence of all known human-made greenhouse gases except carbon dioxide (including CFCs, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone) to see if their net effect could even be felt on a global scale in the climate system. To their surprise, Hansen’s team found that the warming effect of all those gases added together is comparable to the warming effect of carbon dioxide alone. Initial efforts to observe Earth’s temperature were limited to the Northern Hemisphere, and they showed a cooling trend from 1940 to 1970 (jagged line). Scientists estimated the relative effects of carbon dioxide (warming, top curve) and aerosols (cooling, bottom curve) on climate, but did not have enough data to make precise predictions. (Graph from Mitchell, 1972.)The simple model also allowed Hansen to simulate the climate impact of Mount Agung’s eruption 15 years after the event. The model indicated that loading the atmosphere with volcanic aerosols should have caused a global cooling—a prediction that agreed pretty well with observed temperature data. The model demonstrated that both human and natural activities could force climate to change. But Hansen knew that natural forcings, like volcanic eruptions or changes in the Sun’s activity, tend to go up and down over a long period of time whereas the human forcing from greenhouse gas emissions was steadily increasing. “It became clear that human-produced greenhouse gases should become a dominant forcing and even exceed other climate forcings, such as volcanoes or the Sun, at some point in the future,” Hansen observed. How soon would the human forcing begin to dominate? No one knew. In 1981, NASA scientists predicted the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global temperatures between 1950 and 2100 based on different scenarios for energy growth rates and energy source. If energy use stayed constant at 1980 levels (scenario 3, bottom lines), temperatures were predicted to rise just over 1°C. If energy use grew moderately (scenario 2, middle lines), warming would be 1–2.5 °C. Fast growth (scenario 1, top lines) would cause 3–4°C of warming. In each scenario, the warming was predicted to be less if some of the energy was supplied by non-fossil (renewable) fuels instead of coal-based, synthetic fuels (synfuels). (Graph from Hansen et al., 1981.)To find out, Hansen would need real-world data on a global scale. He requested data tapes from Roy Jenne, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who was widely recognized in the 1970s as having the best weather dataset in the world. Of course, there remained the problem that the weather stations supplying Jenne’s dataset were rather sparse compared to the vastness of Earth’s surface. To test his climate model, Hansen calculated the cooling effect of Mount Agung’s eruption (dotted line) and compared the results with real-world temperature measurements (solid line). Despite its simplicity, the model accurately reflected the dip in tropical temperatures caused by the eruption. (Graph from Hansen et al., 1978.)“The lack of any global temperature analysis [for Earth] did not seem right to me,” Hansen recalled. Drawing from his previous work in estimating the average planetary surface temperature of Venus, he knew that if scientists had measurements from as many places on another planet as were available from Jenne’s dataset they would not hesitate to estimate Earth’s global temperature. He decided to try. At the outset Hansen knew that weather fluctuations would introduce short-term temperature anomalies into the weather station dataset that are not the same thing as climate change. But he reasoned that by taking averages over several years, and appropriately “weighting” the weather stations’ data, it should be possible to determine meaningful temperature changes over longer time periods. In the mid-1970s, he hired Jeremy Barberra, a New York University undergraduate student at the time, to automate the processing of Jenne’s dataset. They decided to process the data to produce average temperature changes, and not absolute temperature. “If you focus your analysis on temperature change, and not on determining absolute temperature values, then the station coverage is adequate,” Hansen explained. “What matters is the long-term mean over large scales, not single measurements from individual stations.” The success of Hansen’s and Barberra’s approach depended on the principle that temperature anomalies have a much larger scale than absolute temperature. Consider a mountain on which it can be much cooler on one side than the other. This example illustrates how absolute temperature patterns can vary sharply over relatively short distances. On the other hand, temperature anomalies are typically large-scale events driven by Rossby Waves. Rossby Waves are slow-moving waves in the ocean or atmosphere, driven from west to east by the force of Earth spinning. We see such waves in the atmosphere as large-scale meanders of the mid-latitude jet stream. Weather stations (red dots) are scattered unevenly across the globe. They are especially sparse in Africa and over the oceans. Before scientists could be confident in global temperature records, Hansen needed to demonstrate that widely spaced observations captured global temperature trends accurately. (NASA map by Robert Simmon, based on data from the National Climatic Data Center.)“If it is an unusually warm winter in New York, it is probably also warm in Washington, D.C., for example,” Hansen explained. “At high- and mid-latitudes Rossby Waves are the dominant cause of short-term temperature variations. And since those are fairly long waves we didn’t think we needed a station at every one degree of separation.” A station at every 1 degree would mean a station roughly every 80 kilometers (at mid-latitudes). But in a 1987 paper appearing in the Hansen and Sergei Lebedeff demonstrated that the temperature readings of weather stations within 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of one another are highly correlated. The close correlation meant they could map global temperature changes over time despite the fact that weather stations are widely spaced and located mainly on continents and islands. Here’s basically how their approach works: For each center point in a global grid of 1-degree boxes they let all weather station data within a 1,200-kilometer radius influence the estimated temperature change at that point. They gave greatest “weight” to the station closest to that point; for all other stations within that radius, they let the weighting fall off linearly with distance, all the way to a weighting of zero for stations 1,200 kilometers away or farther. “Again, our objective was not to determine the precise temperature of individual stations, but to produce a global-scale map of temperature change,” Hansen emphasized. “We were interested in tracking global climate patterns, not local weather variations.” In their 1981 analysis, published in the journal Hansen’s team reported finding that, overall, Earth’s average temperature rose by about 0.4°C for the period from 1880 to 1978. There was roughly 0.1°C of global cooling from 1940-1970. This cooling was less than what Mitchell had found earlier due to the fact that Hansen’s team was now using global data, and not just data from a swath around the Northern Hemisphere. Just as Budyko had predicted, Hansen found that Earth’s cooling trend swung back in the warming direction around 1970 and has been warming ever since. Moreover, Hansen noted, the warming trend observed in real-world data is consistent with his (and others’) global climate model outputs in their 100-year simulations. Absolute temperatures can vary a lot even over short distances, but temperature anomalies usually affect a large region. Most week-to-week temperature variability is driven by Rossby Waves. These waves are easy to see in the looping motions of the jet stream. In this animation, Rossby Waves spiral from left to right toward Europe in the Northern Hemisphere and South Africa in the Southern Hemisphere. The scale of these waves is so large that weather stations separated by 1,000 kilometers or more adequately record the temperature anomalies they produce. (Double-click to pause or replay animation.) (NASA animation by Robert Simmon, based on SEVIRI data copyright EUMETSAT.)“To questions about whether this warming is natural or just a fluctuation, the answer has become clear: the world is getting warmer,” Hansen stated. “This fact agrees so well with what we calculate with our global climate model that I am confident we are looking at warming that is mainly due to increasing human-made greenhouse gases.” Since 1980, global surface temperatures have increased sharply, the Earth’s response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.

That’s why scientists have generally assumed Earth’s ancient skies were much sunnier than they are now. But today, three new studies show how naturally emitted gases from trees can also form the seed particles for clouds. The results not only point to a cloudier past, but they also indicate a potentially cooler future: If Earth’s climate is less sensitive to rising carbon dioxide (CO ) levels, as the study suggests, future temperatures may not rise as quickly as predicted.It's been long thought that sulfuric acid is really the key player [in cloud formation], says atmospheric chemist Chris Cappa of the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the research. The studies “show pretty convincingly that we don't need sulfuric acid around to allow new particles to grow.”Scientists, who agree that CO and other gases from human activities are warming Earth, disagree widely about how sensitive the planet's climate is to these changes. One contentious point is the effect of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that has risen nearly sevenfold in the modern era. Sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen and water to form sulfuric acid, which helps form the aerosol particles that seed cloud droplets. Since clouds reflect sunlight back into space, any extra clouds could have offset a portion of greenhouse gas warming.The new research, however, suggests that the past may have been cloudier than scientists realized. To simulate ancient atmospheric conditions, one research group used CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets), a controlled chamber at CERN, Europe’s particle physics facility near Geneva, Switzerland. Nearly as big as a bus, the chamber was filled with synthetically produced air, allowing precisely controlled chemical conditions. Jasper Kirkby, a CERN particle physicist, and his colleagues introduced a mixture of natural oxidants present in the air and an organic hydrocarbon released by coniferous plants. The hydrocarbon was rapidly oxidized. The only other ingredient allowed in the chamber was cosmic rays, high energy radiation from outer space, which made the molecules clump together into aerosols. Sulfuric acid was not required. In fact, even when the researchers introduced low concentrations of sulfuric acid to the chamber such as might be found in unpolluted air, the aerosol formation rate was unaffected. In a second CLOUD experiment published simultaneously in Nature, researchers showed these same oxidized molecules could rapidly grow the particles to sizes big enough to seed cloud droplets.In search of a pristine atmospheric environment, a second group of researchers made atmospheric measurements of aerosol formation at the Jungfraujoch high altitude research station, 3500 meters up in the Swiss Alps to confirm that this process really occurs in nature. Over the course of a year, they measured the changing concentrations of sulfuric acid and organic molecules in the air. They found more aerosols formed with more organic molecules around, and—crucially—observed formation of organic particles without sulfuric acid. They used exactly the same instruments as at CLOUD to analyze the aerosols: The clusters were formed mainly by organics, says atmospheric chemist Federico Bianchi of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, who led the Jungfraujoch research published today in Science.All the researchers stress sulfuric acid is still a major contributor to cloud formation on Earth today. Today the purely plant-based pathway is much less important than it was preindustrially, Kirkby explains. Crucially, however, the result means climate modelers can't assume that the ancient past was much less cloudy simply because there was less sulfur dioxide. If ancient cloud cover was closer to today’s levels, the increase in the cloud-cooling effect due to human pollution could also be smaller—which means that Earth was not warming up so much in response to increased greenhouse gases alone. In other words, Earth is less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought, and it may warm up less in response to future carbon emissions, says Urs Baltensperger of the Paul Scherrer Institute, who was an author on all three papers. He says that the current best estimates of future temperature rises are still feasible, but the highest values become improbable.  The researchers are currently working toward more precise estimates of how the newly discovered process affects predictions of the Earth's future climate.",http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/earth-s-climate-may-not-warm-quickly-expected-suggest-new-cloud-studies,

The entire planet is accumulating heat due to an energy imbalance. The atmosphere is warming. Oceans are accumulating energy. Land absorbs energy and ice absorbs heat to melt. To get the full picture on global warming, you need to view the Earth's entire heat content.Church et al 2011 extends the analysis of Murphy 2009 which calculated the Earth's total heat content through to 2003. This new research combines measurements of ocean heat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heat through to 2008. Figure 1: Total amount of heat from global warming that has accumulated in Earth's climate system from 1962 to 2008, from Church et al. (2011).  Also see this graphic that shows the ocean heating in two layers, 0-700 meters and 700-2000 meters deep.A look at the Earth's total heat content clearly shows global warming has continued past 1998. So why do surface temperature records show 1998 as the hottest year on record? Figure 1 shows the heat capacity of the land and atmosphere are small compared to the ocean (the tiny brown sliver of land + atmosphere also includes the heat absorbed to melt ice). Hence, relatively small exchanges of heat between the atmosphere and ocean can cause significant changes in surface temperature.In 1998, an abnormally strong El Nino caused heat transfer from the Pacific Ocean to the atmosphere. Consequently, we experienced above-average surface temperatures. Conversely, the last few years have seen moderate La Nina conditions which had a cooling effect on global temperatures. And the last few months have swung back to warmer El Nino conditions. This has coincided with the warmest June-August sea surface temperatures on record. This internal variation where heat is shuffled around our climate is the reason why surface temperature is such a noisy signal.Figure 1 also underscores just how much global warming the planet is experiencing. Since 1970, the Earth's heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 1021 Joules per year. In more meaningful terms, the planet has been accumulating energy at a rate of 190,260 gigawatts. Considering a typical nuclear power plant has an output of 1 gigawatt, imagine 190,000 nuclear power plants pouring their energy output directly into our oceans. Our climate is still accumulating heat. Global warming is still happening.Moreover, even if we focus exclusively on surface and lower atmosphere temperatures, the warming continues.  Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmosphere warming trends have remained very steady in recent years (Figure 3).Figure 2: Five datasets of global surface temperature and lower troposphere temperature are shown before and after removing the short-term effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), solar variability, and volcanic aerosols.  A 12-month running average was applied to each dataset.Figure 3: Average of all five data sets (GISS, NCDC, HadCRU, UAH, and RSS) with the effects of ENSO, solar irradiance, and volcanic emissions removed (Foster and Rahmstorf 2011)Here is a related lecture-video from Denial101x - Making Sense of Climate Science DenialLast updated on 5 July 2015 by pattimer.

Not So Fast,"But the conclusions the study's author drew from that research—that even preventing any further increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could still leave the Earth doomed to a catastrophic temperature rise of up to 7 degrees Celsius (about 13 degrees Fahrenheit)—isn't supported by the data, several top scientists said.The study's author, a former postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, said she wasn't attempting to offer a detailed climate forecast. But she examined the past's tight link between sea-surface temperature changes and natural releases of carbon dioxide and tried to show what that might imply for the future. Her result: an alarming 3 to 7 degree Celsius temperature rise by several thousand years from now, even if fossil fuel emissions were capped today.We do find this close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases that is remarkably stable, and what the study is developing is the coupling factor between the two, said Carolyn Snyder, who now works on climate issues for the Environmental Protection Agency.Other scientists said, however, that Snyder has drastically overstated what that relationship tells us about today's situation because of the way she extrapolates from past ice ages to the very different climate of the modern era.The number she gets is huge, said Eric Steig, an earth sciences professor at the University of Washington. She's making a statement about the future, but I don't find anything in the paper that explains why she thinks she can do that.In reality, NASA's Schmidt said, if greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere stay the same as today, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 degrees Celsius to 1 degree Celsius. Other studies suggest they could hit 2 degrees. But, Schmidt said, no credible evidence suggests they could rise 7 degrees—and nothing in the study changes that.For decades scientists have used ocean sediment cores to reconstruct past sea-surface temperatures at particular times and locations. Snyder cataloged and organized 20,000 such reconstructions from 59 sediment cores. Then she went through the painstaking process of weighting them to build a time line of global average surface temperatures.During the past two million years, Earth has cycled in and out of prolonged ice ages; the most recent one ended 11,000 years ago. Snyder’s new time line reveals that temperatures gradually cooled to a nadir around 1.2 million years ago. She also found that the phenomenon known as polar amplification—the tendency of temperatures at the poles to fluctuate more strongly than the global average—has held steady for the past 800,000 years.It has also been known for a long time, from analysis of ancient air bubbles trapped in Antarctic and Greenland ice cores, that atmospheric levels of CO2 fluctuated naturally during the ice ages—and that they were tightly correlated with local air temperature above the ice. Snyder’s time line confirms that correlation between CO2 and temperature at the global scale and over two million years.Her mistake, the critics said, was in the simplistic way she used that correlation to infer the Earth’s sensitivity to CO2—not only in the past but also in the future. Her conclusions simply didn't make sense, they said. The reason is that much of the variation in temperature during the ice ages was caused by factors other than CO2.Over the past 800,000 years, massive ice sheets have expanded across the northern continents and then retreated again every 100,00 years or so. The cycle is driven by variations in Earth’s orbit about the sun, which determine whether enough sunlight falls on the Northern Hemisphere in summer to melt ice.The presence of ice itself has a dramatic cooling effect on the planet, because it reflects sunlight back to space. Conversely, when ice melts at the end of a glacial period, the increased absorption of sunlight warms the whole planet—triggering feedback effects, including a rise in CO2, that warm it further.Whereas today the rise in CO2 is the prime driver of global warming, during the ice-age period it was merely an important feedback. Snyder insisted she wasn't trying to suggest that greenhouse gases caused all the temperature changes back then. But the paper's critics said her work had in effect done just that, and as a result produced what seems an exaggerated estimate of the current sensitivity to CO2.The question of just how sensitive Earth’s climate will be over the long term to our CO2 emissions remains open. There is evidence that over millennia, once all the feedbacks have had a chance to kick in, the warming could be indeed be substantially larger than in the short term.",https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/global-warming-study-13-degrees-is-wrong-climate-change/,

The Paris climate accord, adopted less than one year ago by nearly 200 nations, resolved to slash global carbon emissions so that we don’t exceed 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming overall. If we’ve already blown that target, not only is humanity’s landmark climate agreement depressingly obsolete, coral reefs, low-lying island nations, and many of our planet’s coastal cities are doomed.Here’s the good news: prominent experts are calling this a load of malarkey. “This is simply wrong,” Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told Gizmodo. “The actual committed warming is only 0.5 to perhaps 1 [degree Celsius]—and nothing in the study changes that.”The new study, which appears today in Nature, is a reconstruction of Earth’s average surface temperature over the past two million years. To produce it, Stanford’s Carolyn Snyder assembled dozens of sea surface temperature records that researchers around the world developed from ocean sediment cores. Doing so was no easy feat: “The communities that produce these data are notoriously cagey about releasing it,” Schmidt said, adding that Snyder “did a big amount of work putting together disparate data” in what will no doubt prove a valuable resource for the climate science community.And yet, “Scientist Compiles Dozens of Datasets to Reconstruct Two Million Years of Global Average Surface Temperatures,” is hardly a sexy headline. The study might have flown under the public radar, except for a section toward the end, where Snyder used her new dataset to estimate the sensitivity of Earth’s surface temperature to levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.When Synder compared her temperature record with a record of atmospheric CO2 over the last two million years, she found a strongly positive, linear relationship between the two. From the slope of that relationship, she determined that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 levels translates to a 9 degree Celsius change in global average surface temperatures, give or take four degrees. Snyder dubbed this amount the “Earth system sensitivity” (ESS).“This research follows previous work in the literature that defined the correlation relationship between global temperature and greenhouse gas radiative forcing changes as ESS or S[ghg] as a way to summarize patterns in the Earth’s past climate,” Snyder told Gizmodo.Here’s where things get hairy. Since humans have increased global CO2 levels roughly 40 percent since the start of the industrial revolution, Snyder decided to use her correlation from the past to project forward in time: “This [Earth system sensitivity] result suggests that stabilization at today’s greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 degrees Celsius,” she writes in the study’s abstract.Using a past relationship to say something about the future is not illogical. The problem lies in the details of the complex relationship between climate and CO2.We know that as atmospheric CO2 levels have risen and fallen throughout Earth’s history, the planet’s temperature has changed. We know that when temperatures change, ice sheets to retreat and advance. Animals and plants flourish and die off; the amount of dust in the atmosphere rises and falls. All of these changes, which climate scientists call “Earth-system feedbacks” trigger more climate change, further altering the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.“You have this chicken and egg situation, where ice changes, which causes CO2 to change, which causes ice to change, and so on and so forth,” Schmidt said. When you do a correlation between a temperature and CO2 over a long enough timescale, all of these feedbacks get smeared together. As Schmidt put it, “you’re mixing the impact of CO2 on climate, and climate on CO2.”In other words, the “Earth system sensitivity” cannot be interpreted as the direct impact of atmospheric CO2 on global temperatures, as some media outlets are now reporting. In principle, CO2 doesn’t have to impact climate at all in order to see a positive correlation.“Simply correlating the temperature with the CO2 level would tell you climate sensitivity only if you knew that CO2 changes explained the vast majority of the temperature changes,” Ken Caldeira, a climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science told Gizmodo. “However, we don’t know that. So, the climate sensitivity numbers reported in this paper should be regarded as an upper bound on possible ‘Earth System’ climate sensitivity. Real ‘Earth System’ climate sensitivity is likely substantially lower.”In all fairness, Snyder said that it was not her intention to make a prediction about how human carbon emissions will impact future climate. “This research cannot and does not provide a forecast or prediction for future climate change,” she said. “All we can say is, if we take the past relationship [between temperature and CO2] and translate it forward, this is what we get.”Unfortunately, the nuances and criticisms I’ve outlined above weren’t made clear enough in the study’s abstract, nor did they make it into a Nature press release issued under embargo last week, which repackaged what was a minor point of the new research into a dramatic punchline.The planet is definitely warming, and human carbon emissions are definitely to blame. But ten degrees or more of guaranteed future heat? We still have time to prevent that.",http://gizmodo.com/dont-worry-the-earth-is-not-locked-into-ten-degrees-of-1787058579,

One-third of Man’s entire influence on climate since the Industrial Revolution has occurred since February 1997. Yet the 225 months since then show no global warming at all (Fig. 1). With this month’s RSS temperature record, the Pause beats last month’s record and now stands at 18 years 9 months.Figure 1. The least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset shows no global warming for 18 years 9 months since February 1997, though one-third of all anthropogenic forcings have occurred during the period of the Pause.The accidental delegate from Burma provoked shrieks of fury from the congregation during the final benediction in Doha three years ago, when he said the Pause had endured for 16 years. Now, almost three years later, the Pause is almost three years longer.It is worth understanding just how surprised the modelers ought to be by the persistence of the Pause. NOAA, in a very rare fit of honesty, admitted in its 2008 State of the Climate report that 15 years or more without global warming would demonstrate a discrepancy between prediction and observation. The reason for NOAA’s statement is that there is supposed to be a sharp and significant instantaneous response to a radiative forcing such as adding CO2 to the air.The steepness of this predicted response can be seen in Fig. 1a, which is based on a paper on temperature feedbacks by Professor Richard Lindzen’s former student Professor Gerard Roe in 2009. The graph of Roe’s model output shows that the initial expected response to a forcing is supposed to be an immediate and rapid warming. But, despite the very substantial forcings in the 18 years 9 months since February 1997, not a flicker of warming has resulted.Figure 1a: Models predict rapid initial warming in response to a forcing. Instead, no warming at all is occurring. Based on Roe (2009).At the Heartland and Philip Foster events in Paris, I shall reveal in detail the three serious errors that have led the models to over-predict warming so grossly.The current el Niño, as Bob Tisdale’s distinguished series of reports here demonstrates, is at least as big as the Great el Niño of 1998. The RSS temperature record is beginning to reflect its magnitude.From next month on, the Pause will probably shorten dramatically and may disappear altogether for a time. However, if there is a following la Niña, as there often is, the Pause may return at some time from the end of next year onward.The hiatus period of 18 years 9 months is the farthest back one can go in the RSS satellite temperature record and still show a sub-zero trend. The start date is not cherry-picked: it is calculated. And the graph does not mean there is no such thing as global warming. Going back further shows a small warming rate.And yes, the start-date for the Pause has been inching forward, though just a little more slowly than the end-date, which is why the Pause continues on average to lengthen.So long a stasis in global temperature is simply inconsistent not only with the extremist predictions of the computer models but also with the panic whipped up by the rent-seeking profiteers of doom rubbing their hands with glee in Paris.The UAH dataset shows a Pause almost as long as the RSS dataset. However, the much-altered surface tamperature datasets show a small warming rate (Fig. 1b).Figure 1b. The least-squares linear-regression trend on the mean of the GISS, HadCRUT4 and NCDC terrestrial monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly datasets shows global warming at a rate equivalent to 1.1 C° per century during the period of the Pause from January 1997 to September 2015.Bearing in mind that one-third of the 2.4 W m–2 radiative forcing from all manmade sources since 1750 has occurred during the period of the Pause, a warming rate equivalent to little more than 1 C°/century is not exactly alarming.As always, a note of caution. Merely because there has been little or no warming in recent decades, one may not draw the conclusion that warming has ended forever. The trend lines measure what has occurred: they do not predict what will occur.The Pause – politically useful though it may be to all who wish that the “official” scientific community would remember its duty of skepticism – is far less important than the growing discrepancy between the predictions of the general-circulation models and observed reality.The divergence between the models’ predictions in 1990 (Fig. 2) and 2005 (Fig. 3), on the one hand, and the observed outturn, on the other, continues to widen. If the Pause lengthens just a little more, the rate of warming in the quarter-century since the IPCC’s First Assessment Report in 1990 will fall below 1 C°/century equivalent.Figure 2. Near-term projections of warming at a rate equivalent to 2.8 [1.9, 4.2] K/century, made with “substantial confidence” in IPCC (1990), for the 309 months January 1990 to September 2015 (orange region and red trend line), vs. observed anomalies (dark blue) and trend (bright blue) at just 1.02 K/century equivalent, taken as the mean of the RSS and UAH v.6 satellite monthly mean lower-troposphere temperature anomalies.Figure 3. Predicted temperature change, January 2005 to September 2015, at a rate equivalent to 1.7 [1.0, 2.3] Cº/century (orange zone with thick red best-estimate trend line), compared with the near-zero observed anomalies (dark blue) and real-world trend (bright blue), taken as the mean of the RSS and UAH v.6 satellite lower-troposphere temperature anomalies.As ever, the Technical Note explains the sources of the IPCC’s predictions in 1990 and in 2005, and also demonstrates that that according to the ARGO bathythermograph data the oceans are warming at a rate equivalent to less than a quarter of a Celsius degree per century. In a rational scientific discourse, those who had advocated extreme measures to prevent global warming would now be withdrawing and calmly rethinking their hypotheses. However, this is not a rational scientific discourse. On the questioners’ side it is rational: on the believers’ side it is a matter of increasingly blind faith. The New Superstition is no fides quaerens intellectum.These facts should be shown to anyone who persists in believing that, in the words of Mr Obama’s Twitteratus, “global warming is real, manmade and dangerous”.Our latest topical graph shows the least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean lower-troposphere dataset for as far back as it is possible to go and still find a zero trend. The start-date is not “cherry-picked” so as to coincide with the temperature spike caused by the 1998 el Niño. Instead, it is calculated so as to find the longest period with a zero trend.The fact of a long Pause is an indication of the widening discrepancy between prediction and reality in the temperature record.The satellite datasets are arguably less unreliable than other datasets in that they show the 1998 Great El Niño more clearly than all other datasets. The Great el Niño, like its two predecessors in the past 300 years, caused widespread global coral bleaching, providing an independent verification that the satellite datasets are better able than the rest to capture such fluctuations without artificially filtering them out.Terrestrial temperatures are measured by thermometers. Thermometers correctly sited in rural areas away from manmade heat sources show warming rates below those that are published. The satellite datasets are based on reference measurements made by the most accurate thermometers available – platinum resistance thermometers, which provide an independent verification of the temperature measurements by checking via spaceward mirrors the known temperature of the cosmic background radiation, which is 1% of the freezing point of water, or just 2.73 degrees above absolute zero. It was by measuring minuscule variations in the cosmic background radiation that the NASA anisotropy probe determined the age of the Universe: 13.82 billion years.The RSS graph (Fig. 1) is accurate. The data are lifted monthly straight from the RSS website. A computer algorithm reads them down from the text file and plots them automatically using an advanced routine that automatically adjusts the aspect ratio of the data window at both axes so as to show the data at maximum scale, for clarity.The latest monthly data point is visually inspected to ensure that it has been correctly positioned. The light blue trend line plotted across the dark blue spline-curve that shows the actual data is determined by the method of least-squares linear regression, which calculates the y-intercept and slope of the line.The IPCC and most other agencies use linear regression to determine global temperature trends. Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia recommends it in one of the Climategate emails. The method is appropriate because global temperature records exhibit little auto-regression, since summer temperatures in one hemisphere are compensated by winter in the other. Therefore, an AR(n) model would generate results little different from a least-squares trend.Dr Stephen Farish, Professor of Epidemiological Statistics at the University of Melbourne, kindly verified the reliability of the algorithm that determines the trend on the graph and the correlation coefficient, which is very low because, though the data are highly variable, the trend is flat.RSS itself is now taking a serious interest in the length of the Great Pause. Dr Carl Mears, the senior research scientist at RSS, discusses it at remss.com/blog/recent-slowing-rise-global-temperatures.Figure T1. Output of 33 IPCC models (turquoise) compared with measured RSS global temperature change (black), 1979-2014. The transient coolings caused by the volcanic eruptions of Chichón (1983) and Pinatubo (1991) are shown, as is the spike in warming caused by the great el Niño of 1998.“The denialists like to assume that the cause for the model/observation discrepancy is some kind of problem with the fundamental model physics, and they pooh-pooh any other sort of explanation.  This leads them to conclude, very likely erroneously, that the long-term sensitivity of the climate is much less than is currently thought.”Dr Mears concedes the growing discrepancy between the RSS data and the models, but he alleges “cherry-picking” of the start-date for the global-temperature graph:“Recently, a number of articles in the mainstream press have pointed out that there appears to have been little or no change in globally averaged temperature over the last two decades.  Because of this, we are getting a lot of questions along the lines of ‘I saw this plot on a denialist web site.  Is this really your data?’  While some of these reports have ‘cherry-picked’ their end points to make their evidence seem even stronger, there is not much doubt that the rate of warming since the late 1990s is less than that predicted by most of the IPCC AR5 simulations of historical climate.  … The denialists really like to fit trends starting in 1997, so that the huge 1997-98 ENSO event is at the start of their time series, resulting in a linear fit with the smallest possible slope.”In fact, the spike in temperatures caused by the Great el Niño of 1998 is almost entirely offset in the linear-trend calculation by two factors: the not dissimilar spike of the 2010 el Niño, and the sheer length of the Great Pause itself. The headline graph in these monthly reports begins in 1997 because that is as far back as one can go in the data and still obtain a zero trend.Fig. T1a. Graphs for RSS and GISS temperatures starting both in 1997 and in 2001. For each dataset the trend-lines are near-identical, showing conclusively that the argument that the Pause was caused by the 1998 el Nino is false (Werner Brozek and Professor Brown worked out this neat demonstration).Curiously, Dr Mears prefers the terrestrial datasets to the satellite datasets. The UK Met Office, however, uses the satellite data to calibrate its own terrestrial record.The length of the Pause, significant though it now is, is of less importance than the ever-growing discrepancy between the temperature trends predicted by models and the far less exciting real-world temperature change that has been observed.Sources of the IPCC projections in Figs. 2 and 3IPCC’s First Assessment Report predicted that global temperature would rise by 1.0 [0.7, 1.5] Cº to 2025, equivalent to 2.8 [1.9, 4.2] Cº per century. The executive summary asked, “How much confidence do we have in our predictions?” IPCC pointed out some uncertainties (clouds, oceans, etc.), but concluded:“Nevertheless, … we have substantial confidence that models can predict at least the broad-scale features of climate change. … There are similarities between results from the coupled models using simple representations of the ocean and those using more sophisticated descriptions, and our understanding of such differences as do occur gives us some confidence in the results.”That “substantial confidence” was substantial over-confidence. For the rate of global warming since 1990 – the most important of the “broad-scale features of climate change” that the models were supposed to predict – is now below half what the IPCC had then predicted.In 1990, the IPCC said this:“under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global mean temperature during the next century of about 0.3 Cº per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2 Cº to 0.5 Cº per decade), this is greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years. This will result in a likely increase in global mean temperature of about 1 Cº above the present value by 2025 and 3 Cº before the end of the next century. The rise will not be steady because of the influence of other factors” (p. xii).Later, the IPCC said:“The numbers given below are based on high-resolution models, scaled to be consistent with our best estimate of global mean warming of 1.8 Cº by 2030. For values consistent with other estimates of global temperature rise, the numbers below should be reduced by 30% for the low estimate or increased by 50% for the high estimate” (p. xxiv).The orange region in Fig. 2 represents the IPCC’s medium-term Scenario-A estimate of near-term warming, i.e. 1.0 [0.7, 1.5] K by 2025.The IPCC’s predicted global warming over the 25 years from 1990 to the present differs little from a straight line (Fig. T2).Figure T2. Historical warming from 1850-1990, and predicted warming from 1990-2100 on the IPCC’s “business-as-usual” Scenario A (IPCC, 1990, p. xxii).Because this difference between a straight line and the slight uptick in the warming rate the IPCC predicted over the period 1990-2025 is so small, one can look at it another way. To reach the 1 K central estimate of warming since 1990 by 2025, there would have to be twice as much warming in the next ten years as there was in the last 25 years. That is not likely.But is the Pause perhaps caused by the fact that CO2 emissions have not been rising anything like as fast as the IPCC’s “business-as-usual” Scenario A prediction in 1990? No: CO2 emissions have risen rather above the Scenario-A prediction (Fig. T3).Figure T3. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, etc., in 2012, from Le Quéré et al. (2014), plotted against the chart of “man-made carbon dioxide emissions”, in billions of tonnes of carbon per year, from IPCC (1990).Plainly, therefore, CO2 emissions since 1990 have proven to be closer to Scenario A than to any other case, because for all the talk about CO2 emissions reduction the fact is that the rate of expansion of fossil-fuel burning in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, etc., far outstrips the paltry reductions we have achieved in the West to date.True, methane concentration has not risen as predicted in 1990 (Fig. T4), for methane emissions, though largely uncontrolled, are simply not rising as the models had predicted. Here, too, all of the predictions were extravagantly baseless.The overall picture is clear. Scenario A is the emissions scenario from 1990 that is closest to the observed CO2 emissions outturn.Figure T4. Methane concentration as predicted in four IPCC Assessment Reports, together with (in black) the observed outturn, which is running along the bottom of the least prediction. This graph appeared in the pre-final draft of IPCC (2013), but had mysteriously been deleted from the final, published version, inferentially because the IPCC did not want to display such a plain comparison between absurdly exaggerated predictions and unexciting reality.To be precise, a quarter-century after 1990, the global-warming outturn to date – expressed as the least-squares linear-regression trend on the mean of the RSS and UAH monthly global mean surface temperature anomalies – is 0.27 Cº, equivalent to little more than 1 Cº/century. The IPCC’s central estimate of 0.71 Cº, equivalent to 2.8 Cº/century, that was predicted for Scenario A in IPCC (1990) with “substantial confidence” was approaching three times too big. In fact, the outturn is visibly well below even the least estimate.In 1990, the IPCC’s central prediction of the near-term warming rate was higher by two-thirds than its prediction is today. Then it was 2.8 C/century equivalent. Now it is just 1.7 Cº equivalent – and, as Fig. T5 shows, even that is proving to be a substantial exaggeration.One frequently-discussed explanation for the Great Pause is that the coupled ocean-atmosphere system has continued to accumulate heat at approximately the rate predicted by the models, but that in recent decades the heat has been removed from the atmosphere by the ocean and, since globally the near-surface strata show far less warming than the models had predicted, it is hypothesized that what is called the “missing heat” has traveled to the little-measured abyssal strata below 2000 m, whence it may emerge at some future date.Actually, it is not known whether the ocean is warming: each of the 3600 automated ARGO bathythermograph buoys takes just three measurements a month in 200,000 cubic kilometres of ocean – roughly a 100,000-square-mile box more than 316 km square and 2 km deep. Plainly, the results on the basis of a resolution that sparse (which, as Willis Eschenbach puts it, is approximately the equivalent of trying to take a single temperature and salinity profile taken at a single point in Lake Superior less than once a year) are not going to be a lot better than guesswork.Unfortunately ARGO seems not to have updated the ocean dataset since December 2014. However, what we have gives us 11 full years of data. Results are plotted in Fig. T5. The ocean warming, if ARGO is right, is equivalent to just 0.02 Cº decade–1, equivalent to 0.2 Cº century–1.Figure T5. The entire near-global ARGO 2 km ocean temperature dataset from January 2004 to December 2014 (black spline-curve), with the least-squares linear-regression trend calculated from the data by the author (green arrow).Finally, though the ARGO buoys measure ocean temperature change directly, before publication NOAA craftily converts the temperature change into zettajoules of ocean heat content change, which make the change seem a whole lot larger.The terrifying-sounding heat content change of 260 ZJ from 1970 to 2014 (Fig. T6) is equivalent to just 0.2 K/century of global warming. All those “Hiroshima bombs of heat” of which the climate-extremist websites speak are a barely discernible pinprick. The ocean and its heat capacity are a lot bigger than some may realize.Figure T6. Ocean heat content change, 1957-2013, in Zettajoules from NOAA’s NODC Ocean Climate Lab: http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT, with the heat content values converted back to the ocean temperature changes in Kelvin that were originally measured. NOAA’s conversion of the minuscule warming data to Zettajoules, combined with the exaggerated vertical aspect of the graph, has the effect of making a very small change in ocean temperature seem considerably more significant than it is.Converting the ocean heat content change back to temperature change reveals an interesting discrepancy between NOAA’s data and that of the ARGO system. Over the period of ARGO data, from 2004-2014, the NOAA data imply that the oceans are warming at 0.05 Cº decade–1, equivalent to 0.5 Cº century–1, or rather more than double the rate shown by ARGO.ARGO has the better-resolved dataset, but since the resolutions of all ocean datasets are very low one should treat all these results with caution.What one can say is that, on such evidence as these datasets are capable of providing, the difference between underlying warming rate of the ocean and that of the atmosphere is not statistically significant, suggesting that if the “missing heat” is hiding in the oceans it has magically found its way into the abyssal strata without managing to warm the upper strata on the way.On these data, too, there is no evidence of rapid or catastrophic ocean warming.Furthermore, to date no empirical, theoretical or numerical method, complex or simple, has yet successfully specified mechanistically either how the heat generated by anthropogenic greenhouse-gas enrichment of the atmosphere has reached the deep ocean without much altering the heat content of the intervening near-surface strata or how the heat from the bottom of the ocean may eventually re-emerge to perturb the near-surface climate conditions relevant to land-based life on Earth.Figure T7. Near-global ocean temperatures by stratum, 0-1900 m, providing a visual reality check to show just how little the upper strata are affected by minor changes in global air surface temperature. Source: ARGO marine atlas.Most ocean models used in performing coupled general-circulation model sensitivity runs simply cannot resolve most of the physical processes relevant for capturing heat uptake by the deep ocean.Ultimately, the second law of thermodynamics requires that any heat which may have accumulated in the deep ocean will dissipate via various diffusive processes. It is not plausible that any heat taken up by the deep ocean will suddenly warm the upper ocean and, via the upper ocean, the atmosphere.If the “deep heat” explanation for the Pause were correct (and it is merely one among dozens that have been offered), the complex models have failed to account for it correctly: otherwise, the growing discrepancy between the predicted and observed atmospheric warming rates would not have become as significant as it has.In early October 2015 Steven Goddard added some very interesting graphs to his website. The graphs show the extent to which sea levels have been tampered with to make it look as though there has been sea-level rise when it is arguable that in fact there has been little or none.Why were the models’ predictions exaggerated?In 1990 the IPCC predicted – on its business-as-usual Scenario A – that from the Industrial Revolution till the present there would have been 4 Watts per square meter of radiative forcing caused by Man (Fig. T8):However, from 1995 onward the IPCC decided to assume, on rather slender evidence, that anthropogenic particulate aerosols – mostly soot from combustion – were shading the Earth from the Sun to a large enough extent to cause a strong negative forcing. It has also now belatedly realized that its projected increases in methane concentration were wild exaggerations. As a result of these and other changes, it now estimates that the net anthropogenic forcing of the industrial era is just 2.3 Watts per square meter, or little more than half its prediction in 1990 (Fig. T9):Even this, however, may be a considerable exaggeration. For the best estimate of the actual current top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance (total natural and anthropo-genic net forcing) is only 0.6 Watts per square meter (Fig. T10):Figure T10. Energy budget diagram for the Earth from Stephens et al. (2012)In short, most of the forcing predicted by the IPCC is either an exaggeration or has already resulted in whatever temperature change it was going to cause. There is little global warming in the pipeline as a result of our past and present sins of emission.It is also possible that the IPCC and the models have relentlessly exaggerated climate sensitivity. One recent paper on this question is Monckton of Brenchley et al. (2015), which found climate sensitivity to be in the region of 1 Cº per CO2 doubling (go to scibull.com and click “Most Read Articles”). The paper identified errors in the models’ treatment of temperature feedbacks and their amplification, which account for two-thirds of the equilibrium warming predicted by the IPCC.Professor Ray Bates gave a paper in Moscow in summer 2015 in which he concluded, based on the analysis by Lindzen & Choi (2009, 2011) (Fig. T10), that temperature feedbacks are net-negative. Accordingly, he supports the conclusion both by Lindzen & Choi (1990) (Fig. T11) and by Spencer & Braswell (2010, 2011) that climate sensitivity is below – and perhaps considerably below – 1 Cº per CO2 doubling.A growing body of reviewed papers find climate sensitivity considerably below the 3 [1.5, 4.5] Cº per CO2 doubling that was first put forward in the Charney Report of 1979 for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and is still the IPCC’s best estimate today.On the evidence to date, therefore, there is no scientific basis for taking any action at all to mitigate CO2 emissions.Finally, how long will it be before the Freedom Clock (Fig. T12) reaches 20 years without any global warming? If it does, the climate scare will become unsustainable.Figure T12.

While public officials acknowledge the climate is changing, they’re not necessarily saying why or what should be done about it. Let’s clear up a few points. 1.The Earth is heating up. Scientists have measured global temperatures for over a hundred years and see that the Earth is getting hotter. The trend can be best visualized by comparing each year’s average temperature with the long-term average. This figure shows observations of the world’s annual average temperature made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It compares each year’s temperature to the average over the entire century. Blue bars are years that were cooler than average and red bars are years that were warmer than average. In recent decades, the years have always been hotter. If there were no long-term temperature trend, you would expect a mix of red and blue bars throughout the record. That’s not what we see. 2. Human activity is largely responsible for this warming. Over geologic time, the Earth’s average temperature has changed as a result of the sun’s output, the tilt and position of the Earth in its orbit, and the concentration of greenhouse gases. Scientists have developed a good understanding of the natural variations in these factors by examining different proxies for ancient temperatures. Observations tell us that these natural factors have not been changing over the last hundred years or so in a way that would explain the observed temperature increases. In contrast, greenhouse gases have been changing in a way that can explain the observed temperature increases. The pre-eminent record of modern atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is based at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Researchers there have been sampling pristine air from a mountaintop in Hawaii every month since 1958 and analyzing its composition. Their observations show that both the concentration and isotopic composition of CO2 is changing, and is consistent with manmade sources, including the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. Moreover, physics tells us how different climate variables will change the temperature of the atmosphere at different heights. For example, changes in solar output will heat the atmosphere uniformly, while changes due to greenhouse gases will warm the surface but cool the higher part of the atmosphere (the stratosphere). The National Centers for Environmental Information, run by NOAA, conduct monthly observations of atmospheric temperatures at different levels. Its 39-year record shows that the temperature change is not uniform. This is consistent with the effect of greenhouse gases, and inconsistent with other types of natural effects (e.g., changes in the sun’s output). 3. The impacts of climate change are growing, and we need to stop adding to the problem. The result of this buildup of greenhouse gases is that we’re trapping heat within the climate system. The basic physics behind this has been establish for over 100 years. But climate change isn’t just a matter of the air temperature being a few degrees warmer. Higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere lead to increased acidity in the oceans, which is damaging to shellfish and other marine life. Warmer water temperatures and melting of glaciers (due to warmer air temperatures) increase average sea level across the globe. Climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of heat waves, heavy rainfall events, and several other types of extreme weather and disasters. Some observed climate changes are not bad. For example, growing seasons are lengthening in some parts of the country and costs for winter heating go down when temperatures are mild. But the overall impacts are estimated to be negative and costly. The good news is that we’re making progress, and that we have many of the tools right now to make a difference, including expanding use of renewable power; zero-carbon nuclear power, carbon capture, use and storage; energy efficiency technologies, and electric vehicles. Many businesses, cities, and states are pursuing clean energy and clean transportation to improve public health, save money, and create jobs. The question is not whether climate change is happening, but what we want to do about it.",https://www.c2es.org/2017/03/its-certain-the-earth-is-getting-warmer-and-human-activity-is-largely-to-blame/,

Has climate change leveled off, leaving us to adjust to a new, warmer normal? Not according to satellite measurements, say the authors of a paper published yesterday in the journal Scientific Reports. The eight researchers—who together hail from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Seattle—analyzed temperature data from three different satellite groups over a twenty-year period from January 1979 to December 2016. Specifically, they used satellite estimates of global changes in the temperature of the mid-to upper troposphere made available from the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s (NOAA) Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) and the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH). To understand why changes in the atmosphere’s temperature are important to climate research, it helps to recall what anthropogenic climate change is: a warming of both surface and atmospheric temperatures due to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (and its equivalents) thanks to our use of fossil fuels. Climate models predict that not only will the Earth warm on the surface, but also in the troposphere, so scientists use a mix of surface and atmospheric temperatures to assess how quickly the climate is warming.The idea that climate change is leveling off dates back to around 2013, when a leaked Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emerged suggesting that the climate had warmed less quickly over the past 15 years. Some people misread the studies and thought that climate change was putting on the brakes—it wasn’t. The studies actually suggested that the rate of climate change was slowing—easing slightly off the gas—but the system as a whole was still speeding up, or getting warmer. Later studies suggested that even this apparent rate decrease, based mainly on ocean temperatures, was a calibration error. In the past, ocean temperatures were measured on ships that took water samples at varying depths, leading to a consistency problem. At the same time, the samples were generally taken after passing through the ship’s intakes, which are used to cool off engines—so the samples were generally warmer than the surrounding ocean water. Now, most samples are collected by buoys that remain in the water full-time—and because they aren’t warmed by a ship's engine, they tend to be cooler than older measurements, even if the ocean itself is getting warmer. When researchers adjusted for this difference in data collection over time, they found that the ocean's rate of warming was actually increasing, not decreasing.As a result, it’s not wholly unsurprising that in this study, the researchers found something similar. According to their data, the atmosphere has warmed unnaturally quickly over the past 20 years—and it doesn't seem to be tapering off. In fact, you might wonder why scientists would bother publishing such straightforward, unsurprising results. The study doesn’t employ novel methods, and it doesn’t actually advance the field. Scientific Reports is unique among peer-reviewed journals because potential papers aren’t assessed based on perceived importance or significance, but simply on whether or not they're scientifically valid. That explains why they published it, but not why the authors bothered to submit. The study's introduction explains:In other words, the paper is a scientific response to an assertion made by a public official which misrepresents the science. It’s part of an expanding effort by scientists to better communicate their work to a broader audience, and hold officials who tout the importance of scientific and data driven decision making accountable. In recent weeks, the EPA has scrubbed nearly all mention of climate change from its website. Whether or not the agency can choose not to ignore climate change is a decision that will likely be decided by the courts. But the idea that climate change isn't real, or that satellite data doesn't show it, is not supported by the best available data.",https://www.popsci.com/global-warming-leveling-off,

July was the warmest month since modern record keeping began in 1880, with each month since October 2015 setting a new high mark for heat.But Nasa said that records of temperature that go back far further, taken via analysis of ice cores and sediments, suggest that the warming of recent decades is out of step with any period over the past millennium.“In the last 30 years we’ve really moved into exceptional territory,” Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said. “It’s unprecedented in 1,000 years. There’s no period that has the trend seen in the 20th century in terms of the inclination (of temperatures).”“Maintaining temperatures below the 1.5C guardrail requires significant and very rapid cuts in carbon dioxide emissions or co-ordinated geo-engineering. That is very unlikely. We are not even yet making emissions cuts commensurate with keeping warming below 2C.”Schmidt repeated his previous prediction that there is a 99% chance that 2016 will be the warmest year on record, with around 20% of the heat attributed to a strong El Niño climatic event. Last year is currently the warmest year on record, itself beating a landmark set in 2014.“It’s the long-term trend we have to worry about though and there’s no evidence it’s going away and lots of reasons to think it’s here to stay,” Schmidt said. “There’s no pause or hiatus in temperature increase. People who think this is over are viewing the world through rose-tinted spectacles. This is a chronic problem for society for the next 100 years.”Schmidt is the highest-profile scientist to effectively write-off the 1.5C target, which was adopted at December’s UN summit after heavy lobbying from island nations that risk being inundated by rising seas if temperatures exceed this level. Recent research found that just five more years of carbon dioxide emissions at current levels will virtually wipe out any chance of restraining temperatures to a 1.5C increase and avoid runaway climate change.Temperature reconstructions by Nasa, using work from its sister agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the global temperature typically rose by between 4-7C over a period of 5,000 years as the world moved out of ice ages. The temperature rise clocked up over the past century is around 10 times faster than this previous rate of warming.The increasing pace of warming means that the world will heat up at a rate “at least” 20 times faster than the historical average over the coming 100 years, according to Nasa. The comparison of recent temperatures to the paleoclimate isn’t exact, as it matches modern record-keeping to proxies taken from ancient layers of glacier ice, ocean sediments and rock.Scientists are able to gauge greenhouse gas levels stretching back more than 800,000 years but the certainty around the composition of previous climates is stronger within the past 1,000 years. While it’s still difficult to compare a single year to another prior to the 19th century, a Nasa reconstruction shows that the pace of temperature increase over recent decades outstrips anything that has occurred since the year 500.Lingering carbon dioxide already emitted from power generation, transport and agriculture is already likely to raise sea levels by around three feet by the end of the century, and potentially by 70 feet in the centuries to come. Increasing temperatures will shrink the polar ice caps, make large areas of the Middle East and North Africa unbearable to live in and accelerate what’s known as Earth’s “sixth mass extinction” of animal species.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/nasa-climate-change-warning-earth-temperature-warming,

The planet is still warming, but just not as quickly as some climate scientists expected it to.The debate between researchers and doubters reached a crescendo last summer, when scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated their temperature records and concluded that global warming has not slowed down in the 2000s (ClimateWire, June 5, 2015).Now, a group of prominent climate scientists are challenging NOAA’s conclusion in a commentary published this week in Nature Climate Change.“The interpretation [the NOAA group] made was not valid,” said John Fyfe, a climate scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada and lead author of the commentary. “The slowdown is there, even in this new updated data set.”The disagreement may seem esoteric, but it underpins the biggest climate disagreement of the past decades. Climate models, which are virtual representations of our planet, project that temperatures were much higher in the early 2000s than was the case in reality. Scientists have been trying to understand why.Suggestions abound, from cooling aerosols spewed by volcanic eruptions to natural shifts in the Pacific Ocean that happen every decade.Meanwhile, skeptics have seized on the mismatch to suggest that global warming stopped in 1998. Almost all scientists disagree with this. But there are questions about the rate of warming. Most recently, the NOAA study suggested that rising temperatures never even slowed.The NOAA study’s release last summer coincided with a science meeting in Colorado where scientists were discussing how to engineer models to accurately predict climate changes in the coming decades on a regional scale. To do so, they would first have to figure out why models had not projected the global warming slowdown.With the NOAA study’s release, there was this perception that, “Oh, there’s been no slowdown in warming,” said Gerald Meehl, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of the new commentary.The scientists decided to counter the narrative in the boxing ring of academia. That is, a science journal.It is possible that the scientific disagreement could spill over into the skeptic blogosphere. But that is not reason enough to sweep the slowdown under the rug, said Michael Mann, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University and a co-author.“As scientists, we must go where the evidence takes us, we can’t allow our worries about climate contrarians and how they might seek to misrepresent our work to dictate what we do and do not publish,” he said.The blowback against the NOAA study has been some time coming. Tom Karl, lead author of the NOAA study and director of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, and his colleagues compared warming over the past 15 years with the long-term temperature trend between 1950 and 1998 (a 48-year stretch).But scientists say Karl’s comparison of a 15-year stretch with a 48-year stretch was somewhat arbitrary. It is meant to answer the question, has global warming stopped in the long run? The answer to that is a resounding “no,” they say.Scientists are more interested in explaining fluctuations in global temperatures over 10- and 20-year stretches. Throughout Earth’s history, global temperatures have risen and fallen in step with natural fluctuations in the climate system that scientists are only just beginning to unravel.Karl said that understanding this decadeslong variability is important, and his study had dealt with the long-term trend.“There is no disagreement that there is decadal variability, and that it is real and needs to be better understood,” he said, referring to natural causes of warming.One decadal variability played out recently, when warming slowed to 0.11 degrees Celsius per decade between 2001 and 2010. The rate was 0.17 C per decade in the 15 years prior, Fyfe said.Fyfe and his colleagues think the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a natural variance in the climate system that switches between positive, neutral and negative phases, explains the recent slowdown.When ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific are warmer than usual—a positive PDO—the globe sizzles, Meehl of NCAR said.And when the PDO flips to negative and the Pacific cools, global warming slows. The PDO was negative during the early-2000s, and this may explain the slowdown, Meehl said.The only time the PDO was neutral in recent history was between 1971 and 2000, Fyfe said. In that case, the temperature record reflects the response to human-caused climate change, he said.“This is the background trend that you would want to compare recent trends against,” he said.There are other explanations for the slowdown and also for why climate models did not project it. It is possible that the world is not as sensitive to greenhouse gases as the models assume or factors that cool the planet are playing a bigger role than expected, Fyfe said.“These models are not perfect, and they might be overly sensitive,” he said.Answering these fundamental science questions should take precedence over worries about skeptics, Mann of Penn State said. Moreover, the slowdown is over. Record warmth occurred in 2014 and 2015.“So we have every reason to believe that the warming of the planet and the detrimental impacts of that warming will continue unabated if we do not dramatically reduce our emissions,” Mann said.Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/did-global-warming-slow-down-in-the-2000s-or-not/,

Dr Terence Mills, Professor of Applied Statistics at Loughborough University, suggests while British winters may be more milder, summers will remain the same.He argues the Earth’s temperature tends to naturally fluctuate and climate change enthusiasts are focusing on a period between 1975 and 1998 – when the global temperature rose by 0.5 degrees celsius – as a basis for global warming predictions. Dr Mills took a typical method of statistical analysis, which is usually used to predict economic forecasts, to come up with the rate of climate change forecast. By analysing the average temperature of every year since 1850, he was unable to find evidence to support the forecasted changes in the climate which was predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).It had been predicted that there had been a rise in the Earth's temperature of 4 degrees celsiusIn 2014, the global average temperature was the hottest year since records began, only to be trumped again in 2015. In spite of this, Dr Mills thinks that the global average temperature will only rise by 0.25 degrees celsius by the end of the century, if statistics since 1659 are anything to go by – where temperatures have increased by just three degrees celsius in 350 years.However, Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “It would be very foolish for any policymakers to base decisions on this sort of analysis alone while ignoring the climate models that incorporate the physics of the atmosphere and that show increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the future will lead to higher global temperatures.”",http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/646679/Earth-is-NOT-overheating-despite-global-warming-fears-claims-leading-statistician,

NASA says Antarctic has been COOLING for past SIX years,"An intensive scientific study of both Earth's poles has found that from 2009 to 2016 overall temperature has dropped in the southern polar region. NASA’s Operation IceBridge is an airborne survey of polar ice and has finalised two overlapping research campaigns at both the poles.  In the last few weeks NASA has revealed the overall amount of ice has increased at the Antarctic and the amount of sea ice has also extended. Coupled with the latest announcement of slight cooling in the area, it has fuelled claims from climate change deniers that human industrialisation is not having the huge impact on global tenperature as often is claimed.Christopher Shuman, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County glaciologist working at Goddard, said: Field data suggests that there’s been a modest cooling in the area over the 2009–2015 time period, and images collected during that time by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Terra and Aqua satellites show more persistent fast ice (sea ice that is attached to the shore) in the Larsen A and Larsen B embayments” However, Mr Shuman warned that in some areas of the Antarctic, glaciers continued to melt at significant levels, despite  the slight temperature drop. At the south pole, the mission observed a big drop in the height of two glaciers situated in the Antarctic Peninsula. Mr Shuman added: These IceBridge measurements show that once the ice shelves collapse, even some cooling and a good deal of persistent sea ice is not able to hold back these larger glaciers and they continue to lose mass overall.”During one flight in the Peninsula that mapped the drainage area of several glaciers, a drop of more than 490 feet (150 meters) in the height of two glaciers since IceBridge last plotted them, in 2009, was measured.  Both glaciers, called Green and Hektoria, were tributaries to the Larsen B ice shelf, which disintegrated in 2002.  After the ice shelf collapsed, it stopped buttressing the glaciers that fed it, and glacier elevations have fallen dramatically since then. A study published in 2012 showed average elevation losses of up to 82 feet (25 meters) per year for the lower Green and Hektoria glaciers from 2006 to 2011.A NASA spokesman said:So IceBridge’s discovery that both are still losing ice fast many years after the loss of the adjacent ice shelf is “not all that surprising given what we have observed with other sensors,” said Mr Shuman. So, confusingly, the new details of further glacial melt have fuelled those who believe we are causing global warming and polar ice melt. At the Arctic north pole, the project collected much needed measurements of the status of land and sea ice at the end of the Arctic summer melt season. The results of these have yet to be published, but the whole issue is set to be debated in full at a clime change conference in Paris later this month.",http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/622043/GLOBAL-WARMING-NASA-Antarctic-COOLING-six-years-Arctic-north-pole-climate-change,

But when even the head of the EPA doubts the consensus, it can be hard to cut through the noise to understand what research scientists are really using when they express climate-change concern. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]I think plenty of people have pretty serious concerns in their life and they just don't have the time to do all of the homework and the background to figure this out, said Katherine Moore Powell, a climate ecologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.So here's a primer explaining exactly why scientists know the climate is changing and that human activities are causing it.At this point, even the staunchest climate deniers would be hard-pressed to argue that the climate is not warming. Simply put, it's getting hotter out there. Combining land and ocean measurements from 1850 to 2012, researchers have found that the average surface-air temperature globally has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since the beginning of the industrial age. That's according to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in 2014. The top graph in the figure from the IPCC report summary for policy makers shows the temperature anomaly in Celsius.The next graph in this sequence shows sea-level rise, which has gone up globally by about 7.4 inches (0.19 meters) on average since 1901. According to the IPCC, the rate of sea-level rise since the middle of the 1800s has been higher than the rate during the previous two millennia. Scientists use tide gauges and satellite measurements to track sea-level changes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Geologists and other Earth scientists can study rocks, fossils and sediment cores to get a longer-term look at sea-level changes, according to NASA.The bottom two graphs show rising greenhouse-gas concentrations and estimated emissions of carbon dioxide by humans since 1850. The rising trend is evident on each figure. Scientists monitor carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by pumping air into an artificial chamberand shining an infrared light through the sample. Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared light very efficiently — more on that in a minute — so the amount of infrared absorbed can be used to calculate the amount of CO2 in the sample. [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth]The premier (and longest-standing) site for these measurements is the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which recently reported that the planet's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has surpassed 400 parts per million. In 1958, when observations at Mauna Loa began, the annual carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was 315 parts per million.Carbon dioxide is no dark-horse candidate for the warming of the atmosphere. In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (who would later win the first-ever Nobel Prize for Chemistry) published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science that laid out the basics of what's now known as the greenhouse effect.The effect is a result of how energy interacts with the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere as ultraviolet and visible light; some of this solar energy is then radiated back toward space as infrared energy, or heat. The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don't absorb much heat.But the greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane, each have at least three atoms in their molecules. These loosely bound structures are efficient absorbers of the long-wave radiation (also known as heat) bouncing back from the planet's surface. When the molecules in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases re-emit this long-wave radiation back toward Earth's surface, the result is warming.So, temperatures are rising, as are levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But are the two connected?Yes. The evidence is strong. In 2006, scientists presented a poster at the 18th Conference on Climate Variability and Change that even measured the effect directly. Using spectrometers (tools that measure spectra to identify particular wavelengths), the researchers analyzed the wavelengths of infrared radiation reaching the ground. Based on the varying wavelengths, the scientists determined that more radiation was occurring due to the contribution of specific greenhouse gases.Overall, they found that greenhouse gas radiation had increased by 3.5 watts per square meter compared with preindustrial times, a rise of just over 2 percent. Other researchers have noted missing infrared wavelengths in radiation into space, a phenomenon that happens because these missing wavelengths get stuck in the atmosphere.Scientists also know that the extra carbon in the atmosphere is the very same carbon that comes from burning fossil fuels. By analyzing molecular variations called isotopes, researchers can trace the origin of atmospheric carbon, Moore Powell said.We know what the burning of fossil fuels looks like, in a scientific sense, she said.That's not to say that the climate is as simple as an actual greenhouse. Many factors influence global temperatures, including volcanic eruptions and variations in the solar cycle and Earth's orbit that alter the amount of sunlight reaching the planet.But scientists know that volcanoes and the sun aren't to blame for recent climate change. According to the IPCC, volcanic carbon dioxide emissions have been, at most, a hundredth of human CO2 emissions since 1750. In addition, volcanic eruptions cause changes for short timescales of about two years, not the longer-term changes being observed currently.The sun is more complex, but researchers have found that the recent solar-cycle minimum (between 1986 and 2008) was actually lower than the previous two solar-cycle minimums (the sun moves between quiet minimums and active maximums about once every five years). If anything, the IPPC concluded, recent solar activity should have resulted in cooling, not warming. Likewise, a 2012 study found that between 2005 and 2010, a period when solar activity was low, the Earth still absorbed 0.58 watts of excess energy per square meter, continuing to warm despite the lower level of solar energy going into the system.Given the weight of the evidence, scientists have come to a consensus that climate change is happening, and that human greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause.So where are the real scientific debates?There are still a lot of questions left about how fast climate change will happen and what the precise effects will be.What I would say is most uncertain is simply how quickly things are chaning, Moore Powell said. I'm very interested in the pace.One of the major unknowns is the ultimate influence of clouds on climate: Clouds are white, so they reflect sunlight back toward space, which could have a cooling effect. But clouds are also water vapor, which traps heat. And different types of clouds might have warming or cooling effects, so the precise role of clouds in the feedback loop of global warming remains difficult to untangle, scientists have said.Another burning question is how high, and how quickly, the sea level will rise as warming sea waters expand and Antarctic and Arctic ice melts. The IPCC forecasted a rise of 20 to 38 inches (52 to 98 cm), assuming no efforts are made to curb greenhouse gas emissions.That range is broad, largely because the dynamics of Antarctic ice sheets are not completely understood. If Antarctica's land-based glaciers slough off to the sea rapidly with a little bit of warming, that will be bad news for coastal communities, researchers have said. That's why scientists are watching closely right now as a rift is splitting the Larsen C ice shelf on the Weddell Sea. If the giant iceberg-calving event about to occur destabilizes the ice shelf, it could result in the rapid flow of the land-based glaciers behind it into the ocean. This type of rapid glacial flow already occurred nearby, when the Larsen B ice shelf crumbled in 2002.For an ecologist like Moore Powell, there are also myriad questions to answer about how ecosystems will respond to a changing climate. If the pace is slow enough, plants and animals can adapt. But in many places, the change is happening very quickly, Moore Powell said.There's not enough time at this pace for natural adaptation to take over, she said.",https://www.livescience.com/58203-how-carbon-dioxide-is-warming-earth.html,
The Earth is not warming.,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/barry-smitherman/scientific-consensus-remains-planet-warming/,False,False,False,False,False,False,It has been getting a little warm lately,How hot could the Earth get?,"It has been getting a little warm lately. In November 2015, Brits experienced the hottest November days ever recorded in the UK. That was shortly followed by news from the World Meteorological Organization that 2015 is likely to be the hottest year since records began.Global temperatures are now set to reach 1 °C above pre-industrial levels. That is halfway to the politically-agreed upper limit of 2 °C, which was set by world leaders in 2009.For now at least, it seems the world’s temperature is going to go up and up. So how hot could the Earth really get? Is there any limit to the amount of warming humans could eventually cause?Climate change is not a new experience for Earth. The planet has gone through countless temperature fluctuations over its 4.6-billion-year history, from frozen snowball to blazing tropical heat.But despite all these changes, Earth always swings back into roughly the same temperature range. That is because it has mechanisms in place to control its own temperature.A key one is the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases in the air, mainly carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour, trap radiation from the Sun and act like a thermal blanket around the planet.Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would have an average temperature of -18 °C and be covered in ice. Life as we know it would not be able to survive. The greenhouse effect is clearly a good thing, but like all good things, it is possible to have too much.Humans have only been here for a relatively short time, yet we have managed to become the most significant driver of climate change on the planet. By burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees, we are releasing more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and that has caused temperatures to rise.Between 2000 and 2010, our rates of emissions more than quadrupled from the previous decade, and so far there is little sign of this upwards trend reversing. The question is, how much will all these extra greenhouse gases heat the planet over the coming decades and centuries?To predict the state of the planet in the future, scientists build computer models that simulate what will happen to the Earth’s climate. These models are vastly complicated, but they ultimately rely on basic physics such as how air and water behave. By incorporating both man-made and natural changes, the models can estimate how the climate will change when a given amount of greenhouse gases is emitted.These predictions are compiled into reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), most recently in 2013-2014. They suggest that, if our greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase as they have been over the last 50 years, then by the end of this century the world will be at least 4 °C warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution.What’s more, the warming will not stop at the end of this century.The further forward we go in time, the harder it is to predict what will happen.Models currently suggest that we will reach 7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2200, but that temperatures will then stabilise, provided we have stopped emitting greenhouse gases.However, we cannot be certain of this, because the Earth’s climate is a complex system. As the climate warms, several processes operate that can cause even more warming.For instance, snow and ice melt away in a warmer world, exposing dark ground that absorbs the Sun’s heat rather than reflecting it. Similarly, more water vapour evaporates from the surface, and since water vapour is a greenhouse gas this traps even more heat.The oceans actually slow climate change, because carbon dioxide dissolves into them from the air. But warmer oceans can hold less carbon dioxide, leaving ever more in the atmosphere.These feedbacks are relatively well understood, but others are harder to unravel: for example, how changing cloud cover will affect the climate, or when methane locked up in permafrost at the poles will be released. Climate models can only make predictions based on what we know, so as temperatures rise further beyond anything humans have experienced, their predictions become less reliable.So rather than trying to predict what the climate will do from first principles, we can take another approach: we can look at what has happened in the past.About 55 million years ago, the Earth experienced one of the fastest temperature rises in its history.During the “Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum” (PETM), average sea surface temperatures reached up to 10 °C at the poles, compared to -2 °C today. It was a time when there were palm trees as far north as the Arctic Circle, with absolutely no ice at the poles. Some species flourished in the sweltering heat, while others were wiped out.It is clear that greenhouse gases were the main driver. In particular, a massive amount of methane escaped from the seabed into the atmosphere, boosting the greenhouse effect.It is not clear how the methane escaped. Volcanic eruptions or a comet impact have both been proposed, but the most likely explanation is that the Earth was already gradually warming for some other reason. When it reached a certain temperature, the methane stores under the seabed became unstable.The PETM shows clear parallels to today’s world. In particular, the pulse of greenhouse gases that set it in motion seems to have been roughly equivalent to what humans could release if we burnt all recoverable fossil fuels. Those gases warmed the planet by at least 5 °C and maybe as much as 8 °C, probably over a few thousand years.Is that the limit, or could the planet get even hotter than it was during the PETM?There is a theoretical mechanism that could massively overheat the Earth: a “runaway greenhouse effect”.We have already seen that heating the planet releases more greenhouse gases, causing yet more warming. In theory this self-feeding mechanism could become unstoppable, warming the planet by hundreds of degrees.This has never happened on Earth: we would not be here if it had. But scientists believe that it happened to the nearest planet, Venus, 3-4 billion years ago.Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth, so it was hotter to begin with. On the surface, temperatures increased so much that all of its liquid water evaporated into the air. This water vapour trapped even more heat, and with no water on the surface there was nowhere to store carbon dioxide.This led to extreme greenhouse conditions. Eventually all the water vapour was lost to space, leaving Venus with an atmosphere that is 96% carbon dioxide.The planet now has a global temperature of 462 °C. That is hot enough to melt lead, and makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system: even beating out Mercury, which is closer to the Sun.It is almost certain that Earth will succumb to such a catastrophe in a few billion years’ time.As the Sun gets older, it will slowly run out of fuel and swell up into a red giant star. Eventually it will become so bright that the Earth will no longer be able to dissipate the extra heat out into space. The planet’s surface temperature will increase, boiling the oceans and triggering a runaway greenhouse effect that will end all life as we know it, leaving Earth baking under a thick shroud of carbon dioxide.However, these changes to the Sun will happen over billions of years, so they are not a pressing problem. The question is, could we trigger a runaway greenhouse effect ourselves?A study published in 2013 suggests that it is possible, but we would have to release a truly staggering amount of carbon dioxide. This gas currently makes up almost 400 parts per million of the air, up from 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution. To trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, we would have to get the level up to 30,000ppm.That would take about 10 times more carbon dioxide than could be released if we burned all known fossil fuels. There are other sources of greenhouse gases, like the seabed methane that escaped during the PETM, so we cannot absolutely rule it out. But it seems that the likelihood of us being steam-cooked is pretty low.Clearly, that does not mean heating up the planet is a safe thing to do. A temperature rise of just a few °C will have all sorts of unwelcome impacts (see Climate impacts). In particular, parts of the planet could still get too hot for humans to survive.In the hottest places on Earth today, like California’s Death Valley, temperatures can reach well over 50 °C. Such heat is dangerous, but with proper care it is survivable. That is because the air is dry, so we can cool ourselves by sweating.It can be trickier if the air is both hot and humid, as in tropical jungles. The moisture in the air means our sweat evaporates more slowly, so it is harder to cool down.The best way to assess the combination of heat and humidity is to measure the “wet-bulb temperature”. This is the temperature a thermometer reads if the bulb is wrapped in a damp cloth and a fan is blowing air over it. If you are sweating, this is the lowest temperature that you could cool your skin to.Humans have to maintain a core body temperature of 37 °C. To ensure that we can always cool off, we keep our skin at around 35 °C. This implies that a wet-bulb temperature of 35 °C or above, if it was sustained for more than a few hours, would be fatal. Even if we could survive it, we would have to sit still.Even in the most sweltering tropical rainforests, the maximum wet-bulb temperatures recorded have never exceeded 31 °C. This is because hot and humid air is unstable. It rises and cooler air sweeps in beneath, which is what causes tropical thunderstorms.But that could change.Air can only rise if the air around it is cooler and denser. So if climate change heats up the tropics, the air will have to be even hotter and more humid before it starts to rise. A study published in 2010 estimated that, with each 1 °C rise in average global temperature, the maximum wet-bulb temperature will rise by 0.75 °C.That leads to some intimidating conclusions. A 7 °C rise in global temperatures, which we might well hit by 2200, will render some parts of the globe inhospitable to human life. A 12 °C rise in temperature would render half of the Earth’s land area uninhabitable.Of course, we might try to adapt by installing huge amounts of air-conditioning equipment. But apart from being colossally expensive, this would imprison people inside buildings for days or weeks at a time.Even if this never comes to pass, on current trends it is likely that Earth will be 4 °C warmer by the end of this century than it was before the Industrial Revolution, and 3 °C warmer than it is now. That would not directly kill us or render parts of the planet uninhabitable, but it will still create enormous upheaval.20,000 years ago, the Earth was about 4 °C cooler than it is now. This period is known as the “Last Glacial Maximum”. Ice sheets covered most of Canada and northern Europe, including all of the British Isles.Since then Earth has warmed up by 4 °C. That was enough to remove the ice sheets from Europe and North America. The meltwater from the retreating ice raised sea levels by tens of metres, drowning shallow lands beneath the waves.When you consider that, it is easy to imagine what another 4 °C rise in temperature could do to the world around us.",http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151130-how-hot-could-the-earth-get,

That's right -- 19 years!The Telegraph newspaper in the UK has published a fascinating article detailing data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).Ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago. Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick. The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years. As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño, the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “hottest year on record”. This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years. But the BBC won’t be telling us any of this. And we are still stuck with that insanely damaging Climate Change Act, which in this election will scarcely get a mention.But wait, there's more -- much more.Experts told Daily Star Online planet Earth is on course for a “Little Age Ice” within the next three years thanks to a cocktail of climate change and low solar activity, the Brit paper writes on Monday.Research shows a natural cooling cycle that occurs every 230 years began in 2014 and will send temperatures plummeting even further by 2019. Scientists are also expecting a “huge reduction” in solar activity for 33 years between 2020 and 2053 that will cause thermometers to crash. Both cycles suggest Earth is entering a global cooling cycle that could have devastating consequences for global economy, human life and society as we know it. If predictions of the world-wide big freeze come true, the plot to 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow would not be far from reality during winter. ... David Dilley, CEO of Global Weather Oscillations, told Daily Star Online global warming and cooling cycles are determined by the gravitational forces of the Earth, moon and sun. Each cycle lasts around 120,000 years, with sub-cycles of around 230 years. He said: “We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle. “The last global warming cycle ended in 1790 and the year 2020 is 230 following this – thus I have been talking about rapid cooling beginning in 2019.” He said the oncoming cooling will send temperatures plummeting to lows last seen in the 1940s – when the mercury bottomed out at -21C during winter in the UK. He said: “Cooling from 2019 into about 2020 to 2021 will bring world temperatures back to where they were in the 1940s through the 1960s.",http://www.dailywire.com/news/16154/global-quackery-earth-has-not-warmed-past-19-years-joseph-curl,
The Earth is not warming.,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/barry-smitherman/scientific-consensus-remains-planet-warming/,False,False,False,False,False,False,Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.,Show this to every person who doubts that climate change is real,"The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered ‘carbonic acid’ – today known as carbon dioxide – was one of a number of “perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours” to absorb radiant heat.He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be “held fast in the iron grip of frost”.About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.This is one of the certainties in climate science – the world has got warmer.Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage – which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China – is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.As Nasa puts it: “There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.”All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK’s leading ‘sceptic’ think tank, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called ‘lukewarmist’ position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.Both groups are at odds with the science.As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the ‘scientific consensus’ on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million – a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s – to more than 400ppm today.“When we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it’s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it’s not individual predictions,” Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly ‘dangerous’.And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also “a non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic”.Models are often the source of derision from climate ‘sceptics’ or ‘deniers’, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations. Even Arrhenius’ prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true.Most of the world – Donald Trump and some of his supporters aside – has come to the conclusion that fossil fuel use should be phased out rapidly to try to minimise the chances that devastating storms, deadly heatwaves, floods, droughts and other extreme weather events will wreak havoc to an unprecedented extent.Some of the hottest and most humid parts of the world are already getting close to the point where humans are no longer be able to lose enough heat to stay alive outdoors.A 5C average temperature rise might not sound like much to some, but that was about the difference between now and the last global Ice Age when Britain was covered with glaciers.It is thought prudent to restrict warming to a much lower level.Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world agreed to try to keep the temperature rise to well below 2C ... and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C.The tougher target was set amid evidence that at some point between 1.5C to 2C of warming changes could occur that lock in major sea level rise for hundreds or even thousands of years.Professor Richard Betts, a leading Met Office scientist who has also worked on the IPCC's reports, said: “It comes down to how much risk you want to take.“The lukewarmist position that [global warming] is going to be at the low end is not, sadly, based on the full range of the science.“It is within the range of possibilities, but I don’t know how you can be confident in that position.“You are arguing from a position in the hope that it is true.”",http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-explained-real-hoax-fake-truth-global-warming-conspiracy-debunker-a7704166.html,

It was a powerful moment in her speech, hearkening back to the generations of African-Americans forced into bondage in this country. Up until a few decades ago, little attention was paid to looking into who actually laid the foundations and put up the walls of the White House. But what documentation exists today shows that many of Washington, D.C.’s most iconic government buildings, including the White House, were built by slaves.In 2005, Congress put together a task force to shed light on the subject. After months of research, the commission announced that while it would never be able to tell the full story of the slaves who built these buildings, there was no doubt that they were intricately involved in the work, Alexander Lane reported for PolitiFact.“Indifference by earlier historians, poor record keeping, and the silence of the voiceless classes have impeded our ability in the twenty-first century to understand fully the contributions and privations of those who toiled over the seven decades from the first cornerstone laying to the day of emancipation in the District of Columbia,” Senate Historian Richard Baker and Chief of the House of Representatives Office of History and Preservation Kenneth Kato wrote in a foreword to the report.From a geographical standpoint alone, it should come as no surprise that slave laborers were used to build the nation’s capital. Washington, D.C., was built on landed ceded to the federal government by Virginia and Maryland, and at the time the Potomac region was home to almost half of the country’s 750,000 slaves, Lane reports.While the White House Historical Association reports that the D.C. commissioners originally tried to bring cheap workers over from Europe to build the new capital, their recruitment efforts fell short. As a result, they forced local slaves to provide the labor, often renting workers from their masters for year-long periods of time.“Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported,” Lane writes. “And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.”In addition to constructing the buildings, slaves also worked the quarries where the stones for the government buildings came from. Ironically, the Statue of Freedom that sits atop the Capitol dome was made with the help of Philip Reid, a man enslaved by sculptor Thomas Crawford, who was commissioned to build the statue. According to the Architect of the Capitol, Reid was paid $1.25 a day by the federal government for his contributions.“There is no telling how many stories that have been lost because, as a country, we didn’t value these stories,” historian and reporter Jesse J. Holland tells Smithsonian.com. “We’re always learning more about the presidents as we go forward and we’ll also learn more about the people who cooked their meals and dressed them.”",http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/white-house-was-fact-built-slaves-180959916/,

Current case in point: that slaves helped construct the U.S. Capitol, where the son of an African man is set to be sworn in as the nation's 44th president.  Pundits and politicians have mentioned this dozens of times in the past few days, wielding it as potent shorthand for all the historical import of the moment.  Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, mentioned it in her remarks at the Dec. 2, 2008, dedication of the Capitol Visitors Center:  The Capitol was built by slaves, Pelosi said. Today, I want to talk about the fact that it's so appropriate that, though long overdue, this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009, which is the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator.  We wanted to find the details behind the assertion and give it more context.  It turns out there's far less in the historical record on the subject than one might expect. Early historians of the Capitol's construction were largely indifferent to the work of common laborers, both paid and slave. Records from the time are spotty.  Only in the past 15 years or so has attention been trained on the role slaves played in constructing perhaps the nation's most important building — and the work has been led not by professional historians, but by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck.  In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject, which issued a report in conjunction with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, finally bringing a measure of scholarly rigor to bear on the topic.  The task force acknowledged it was not able to tell the full story. No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building — or the White House, says the 2005 task force report, entitled History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol.   But the task force did find plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction. Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the Capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the Capitol. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for Negro hire, a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves.  Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.  Slave crews also toiled at the marble and sandstone quarries that provided the stone to face the structure — lonely, grueling work with bleak living conditions in rural Virginia and elsewhere. Keep the yearly hirelings at work from sunrise to sunset — particularly the Negroes, the commissioners wrote to quarry operator William O'Neale in 1794.  The commissioners' use of slave labor was unremarkable for the time. When the Capitol was constructed, from 1793 to 1826, the building trades in almost every colony augmented the work force with slave labor. This would have been especially true in the Potomac region — the home of about half the 750,000 African-Americans living in the United States, according to the 1972 book Free Negroes in the District of Columbia, by Letitia Woods Brown.  Most of the slaves who worked on the Capitol are known by first name at best — the records refer to a payment of $13.00 to slaveholder Teresa Bent for Nace, for example, and $23.00 to Elizabeth Brent for Harry and Gabe.  But one particular slave, Philip Reid, achieved some renown as an individual. He was a slave laborer for Clark Mills, who was hired to cast the Statue of Freedom, the Capitol's crowning feature. The government paid Reid $1.25 a day for his work.  The statue, a draped female figure holding a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other, stands atop the Capitol dome, 288 feet above the site of Obama's swearing in.  Pelosi might have specified that slaves were only part of the work force, but they were involved with almost every aspect of construction for at least the first several years.

Jefferson was the first to bring his slaves — a dozen of his household servants from Monticello — to 1600 Pennsylvania. After Jefferson, Madison brought slaves from his Virginia estate. The earliest known account of slavery in the White House, Paul Jennings’ A Colored Man’s Reminisces of James Madison, comes from that period. In it, Jennings recounts being moved to Washington, D.C.:Following the building’s destruction during the War of 1812, slave labor was also used to rebuild the mansion between 1814 and 1818.

And George Washington owned between 250 and 300 slaves during his presidency, according to the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies, though he left office before completion of the White House.When Zachary Taylor’s presidency ended with his death in 1850, freed African Americans in D.C. outnumbered those enslaved by almost two to one, according to Census Records. That same year, Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, which was meant to end the slave trade in new states.But it would take another 12 years before slavery was abolished in D.C. on April 16, 1862, with the Emancipation Act, which freed about 3,000 enslaved African Americans. Nine months later, Lincoln signed the more widely recognized Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.For decades after the end of the Civil War, African Americans held an annual Emancipation Day parade in D.C. to demand the full rights of citizenship. A century later, in 2004, D.C. made Emancipation Day a legal holiday, to “symbolize for Americans the triumph of the human spirit over the cruelty of slavery.”",http://time.com/4428368/white-house-slaves-history/,

Was It?,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is very good, but it’s important to discuss the film’s glaring flaw. Sure, it gave us the opportunity to finally see a true teenage Peter Parker. Sure, we finally got to see Donald Glover in a Spider-Man movie. Sure, the movie uses Michael Keaton perfectly as a villain. Sure, seeing Spidey running through a golf course at night while being sprayed by sprinklers was one of the more fun Marvel moments in recent memory. But none of this can compensate for the scene where Zendaya’s character, Michelle, refuses to join her high-school peers inside of the Washington Monument because, she says, it was “built by slaves.” Her teacher, played by Martin Starr, assures her it’s not so and turns to a nearby guard for support, only for the guard to shrug and give him an expression that says, well, kinda.Sorry, Michelle, but we don’t actually know that the Washington Monument was built by slaves. We only know that there’s a very good chance it was. It’s kind of like how we’re not definitely sure Chicken McNuggets are made of undesirable chicken parts, we’re only pretty sure, so we just go ahead and eat them because they’re delicious, you can get 10 pieces for a very good price, and this is America, dammit.You see, Michelle, it’s very simple. Around 1832, the Washington National Monument Society—whose members included John Marshall and James Madison—became responsible for raising money to create a monument to honor of our nation’s first president, who never did anything that could be considered morally repugnant and was a terrific man by all accounts. After a couple of years raising money in one-dollar increments—just like the Bernie Sanders campaign—the society held a contest for the monument’s design.The winner of that contest was Robert Mills, a famous architect and Freemason who is also responsible for the design of other beautiful American structures like the Treasury Building and the General Post Office, which every D.C. resident now knows as that weird hotel across the street from the Spy Museum and that Shake Shack that never has any seats open. Are you following me, Michelle?Because of funding problems that had hindered the project from the beginning, only the obelisk part of Mills’ design was constructed. What we now call the “first phase” of the monument’s construction began in 1848, prior to abolition. This first phase saw the construction of the first 150 feet or so of the monument and ended in 1854 when the Washington National Monument Society’s funding ran out. If—if—slave labor was used during the monument’s construction it would have been during this phase. To spell it out for you, Michelle, let’s turn to Jesse Holland, a respected historian, journalist, and author of the book Black Men Built the Capitol, who wrote in an email:There you go, Michelle. Mr. Holland was kind enough to spell it out for you. There’s no way we can be sure the Washington Monument was built by slaves, but everyone is pretty sure that they contributed. It’s not like this was the White House or the Capitol, both of which were definitely built with the use of slave labor.Furthermore, Michelle, what if we had definitive evidence that the monument was built using slaves? Do we just tear down the Washington Monument? How will D.C. college students survive a drunken night out without their North Star to guide them home when they’re lost in Southeast? Maybe if you spent more time paying attention in class rather than being concerned with our nation’s original sin of slavery, you would have realized that your friend Peter Parker is Spider-Man.",http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/07/11/was_the_washington_monument_built_by_slaves_spider_man_homecoming_says_yes.html,

See Example( s )Recent research has uncovered that the majority of laborers responsible for the construction of the White House and other buildings in the U.S. capital were slaves.The White House wasn't built exclusively by slaves, as other low-level laborers toiled on the project as well.On 25 July 2016, First Lady Michelle Obama gave a well-received speech amid what was otherwise a contentious night at the Democratic National Convention, during which she asserted that the White House had been built by slaves. The remark was a relatively minor detail in Mrs. Obama’s larger commentary about progress in the United States:That is the story of this country. The story that has brought me to the stage tonight. The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, who kept on striving, and hoping, and doing what needed to be done. So that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters — two beautiful intelligent black young women — play with the dog on the White House lawn.The First Lady made the remarks at around the 11:20 mark:In June 2005, Congress commissioned a study [PDF] that looked into slave labor and Washington D.C.-area landmarks. In the foreword, U.S. Senate historian Richard Baker explained that it had been extremely difficult to uncover the details, because slaves were not considered important to the history of the United States at that time:No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building—or the White House; or the homes of founding fathers George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison; or Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. Indifference by earlier historians, poor record keeping, and the silence of voiceless classes have impeded our ability in the twenty-first century to understand fully the contributions and privations of those who toiled over the seven decades from the first cornerstone laying to the day of emancipation in the District of Columbia.According to the paper, slavery was legal in Washington D.C. until April 1862, making it impossible to imagine that enslaved people would not have built and maintained buildings there. A pro-emancipation broadside from 1836 condemned the practice of slavery in the nation’s capital:Jesse Holland, a reporter, researcher, and author of the book The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House, said that his own research indicated that at least two-thirds of laborers who worked on the U.S. Capitol building (and by extension, the White House) were slaves:Through research, we’ve been able to determine that just about 400 of the more than 600 people who worked on the construction of the Capitol were African American slaves. Maybe another fifty or so were African American freedmen. These are people who had their papers to signify that they were free. So the entire building, the center of democracy in the United States, was created by African American slaves.“A lot of people don’t think about it, but the White House is a mansion in a southern area,” Holland told us:Not only the construction as far as building the wall. They not only quarried the clay used for the bricks, they dug the foundation … and they also were used on the interior work of the White House. Slaves were used in the construction of just about everything, including mansions and other government buildings, and they were used in the construction of the White House as well.The White House Historical Association reports that although the government did not own slaves outright, they did hire them from slave owners:The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American — enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings. Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government’s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President’s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.Slaves didn’t exclusively build the White House or other monuments; but a review of historical accounts reveals they had a large role in that construction, one which went almost completely unnoticed and unrecorded for many years.",https://www.snopes.com/was-the-white-house-built-by-slaves/,

Honestly, there's not a Michelle Obama speech out there that's not inspirational, motivational and spirited. Ask Melania Trump.However, there was a part of Obama's speech that spoke to the heart of every black person, and it was when she said, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. This wasn't the first time she'd made this bold statement. She also said this during a commencement speech for the City College of New York, to remind everyone of the major possibilities of black people in this country. The country that slaves helped build.But, of course, trolls had to be trolls, and many of them took to social media to refute Obama's claim that slaves built the White House. Maybe it's because America's limited view of slavery is sweaty black people in cotton fields. Because of the Michelle Obama backlash, reputable site PolitiFact had to break it down so that it was officially broken: Michelle Obama is correct. Slaves indeed built the White House. But that's not all. Our ancestors also built the tobacco and cotton industries … and pretty much … civilization. *Sips tea while side-eyeing.*So take that, haters! And also, take this: six historic American structures that slaves built.Back in 2012, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi teamed up with party leaders in Congress to unveil a commemorative marker in the Capitol Visitors Center to pay tribute to the black men and women who constructed it. She said the marker acted as a memorial to the “tragedy and sin” of slavery. I wonder if the trolls came for her. During the ceremony, Pelosi also said, “For too long, the sacrifice of men and women who built this temple of democracy were overlooked; their toil forgotten; their story ignored or denied, and their voices silenced in the pages of history.And thanks to the good and educated folks over at PolitiFact, we know that Africans were “likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.”According to USA Today, all four major rail networks in North America—Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific and Canadian National—own lines that were built and operated with the labor of enslaved black people. Not only did many slaves construct these railways, but they also ran them.In 2014, President Barack Obama took French President François Hollande on a tour of Jefferson’s estate at Monticello. And when Obama spoke of the visit, he said, “This house also represents the complicated history of the United States. We just visited downstairs, where we know the slaves helped to build this magnificent structure, and the complex relations that Jefferson, the drafter of the Declaration of Independence, had to slavery.” According to reports, slave labor also built George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon and James Madison’s at Montpelier.According to reports, as one of the nation's oldest public universities, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has a long history of slave labor. Not only were many of its buildings built with the hands of slaves and some free black people, but many enslaved black people were servants to students. The memorial was installed on May 11, 2005. Three hundred figurines based on three larger bronze sculptures support the memorial. The central part of the memorial acts as a table and contains this inscription: “The Class of 2002 honors the University’s unsung founders—the people of color bond and free—who helped build the Carolina that we cherish today.”The Root tried to tell you back in 2013: Slave labor built Wall Street and pretty much New York City. Peter Alan Harper wrote:The very name ‘Wall Street’ is born of slavery, with enslaved Africans building a wall in 1653 to protect Dutch settlers from Indian raids. This walkway and wooden fence, made up of pointed logs and running river to river, later was known as Wall Street, the home of world finance. Enslaved and free Africans were largely responsible for the construction of the early city, first by clearing land, then by building a fort, mills, bridges, stone houses, the first city hall, the docks, the city prison, Dutch and English churches, the city hospital and Fraunces Tavern. At the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, they helped erect Trinity Church.Michelle Obama said it. Folks didn't want to believe it. However, PolitiFact reports, Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the president's house.

But few know the historic building was built, in part, by enslaved Americans. And, much like the country it represents, it has a complicated relationship with race. Tell Me More visits the U.S. Capitol to learn more about its past. MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News. Coming up, I share some of my thoughts with you on this historic Martin Luther King Day. But first, we take another of our field trips. We've been popping into places around town where people are getting ready for the big day tomorrow, and nobody is working harder to get ready than the people at the U.S. Capitol, where Barack Obama and every president since James Madison has taken the oath of office. Now, most people know that the Capitol is - more than any other single building - the symbol of our national identity. But what many people may not know is that it was constructed in part by slaves, was once segregated and didn't contain a single statue of an African-American until 23 years ago. I wanted to know more about that history, so a few days ago, I took a trip to the Capitol and was greeted by Fred Beuttler. He is the deputy historian of the House. Mr. FRED BEUTTLER (Deputy Historian, House of Representatives): Welcome to the Capitol. MARTIN: We are standing, I guess, on the plaza in front of the... Mr. BEUTTLER: This is the east front of the Capitol. MARTIN: East front of the Capitol. Mr. BEUTTLER: The east front of the Capitol. Mr. Obama will be inaugurated on the west front of the Capitol. But before 1981, all the inaugurations were here on the east front. MARTIN: So what role exactly did slaves have - or enslaved Americans, as we now like to say - have in the building of the Capitol? Mr. BEUTTLER: It probably started even before the building. When the site was chosen up here, it was called Jenkins Hill. And it was heavily forested, and so you had slaves cutting down trees, landscaping the area, and digging some of the trenches for the foundation. So even before the building had started, you had enslaved peoples working on the Capitol area. In 1793, George Washington lays the cornerstone, and construction starts almost immediately thereafter. MARTIN: I think probably one of the more identifiable features of the Capitol, in addition to the dome, of course, that many people will think of when they think of the Capitol is the Statue of Freedom. If you would just tell us what it looks like for a minute for people who don't remember what it looks like. Mr. BEUTTLER: OK. Well, it's about 19 feet tall. It's a dark bronze with a dark patina on it of a woman with a headdress - kind of a Roman headdress with an eagle on the top, with a shield and a sword and a cloak sort of thrown over her left shoulder. MARTIN: And does Freedom have a connection to the story of African-Americans? Mr. BEUTTLER: That's one of the most exciting stories in the history of the Capitol because what you have is an American sculptor, Thomas Crawford, who was there over in France was given the commission. And he made a plaster model and then shipped it over to the United States. Well, no one was able to take apart the plaster model in order to forge the bronze statue except for one man by the name of Philip Reid. He was an enslaved African-American owned by Clark Mills of South Carolina. And that Statue of Freedom was actually raised up on December 2nd, 1863 into the top of the dome. And what's exciting is that Philip Reid was actually, by that point, a free man because in April of 1862 - April 16th is when the D.C. Emancipation Bill passed. And so Philip Reid, the slave who actually forges the Statue of Freedom, by the time it becomes to the top of this Capitol dome, he's a free man. MARTIN: That is a great story. And I - you do wonder, is there any written record of his feelings about all this? I mean, a man working on the Statue of Freedom who was himself not free, at least at the time he began, and then became free. Do we have any sense of how he felt about that? Mr. BEUTTLER: Yeah, we don't have any firsthand accounts of what his feelings were and the irony of an enslaved man forging the Statue of Freedom. MARTIN: It's a little chilly out here. Now, I know you're from Chicago, so you think this is perfectly fine, but I'd love it if we could go inside now and see if there are any other landmarks and important places to think about which have a connection to African-American history. Can we go? Mr. BEUTTLER: Sure. MARTIN: All right, let's go. (Soundbite of footsteps) MARTIN: OK. Now, we're inside the Capitol, on the floor just below the rotunda at the old east front. Tell us about the old east front. Mr. BEUTTLER: This is one of the original points of the Capitol. What you have here is exposed the original sandstone. One the west front, you do have the original sandstone but it's painted. Here, you can actually - now every visitor going into the Capitol will actually walk by stone that was actually cut by slave labor. And we know actually the names of some of the individuals prior to 1800 that built this. After that, it - they were just contracted with their masters. But the wage was about $5 per month. That went to the master, not to the slave. But some of the individuals were able to earn extra money on the weekends. MARTIN: So we are looking at these cut stones, and I can look at these stones and know that enslaved Americans cut these with their own hands. And we know some of their names. Mr. BEUTTLER: Mm hmm. MARTIN: That's amazing... Mr. BEUTTLER: And sandstone was reasonably easy to cut. I mean, it's arduous but it's really reasonably easy. But when you get into places like Statuary Hall and the old Senate Chamber, there you've got marble columns, and the enormous amount of work it took to cut sandstone is more like triple the cutting of the marble but also the polishing of that stone. You can imagine the amount of effort and labor that went in day after day, all seasons of the year because slaves lived around the Capitol here in small shacks as they were rented out to build this - what is called a Temple of Freedom. MARTIN: And now we're going to head to the rotunda? OK. Let's go. Thank you. (Soundbite of footsteps) MARTIN: So now we're in the Capitol rotunda, which is the place in the building that's underneath the big dome that everybody sees, and it's a very popular destination. In fact, what you can hear going on behind us is there not one but two tours going on as we speak. Fred, why don't you just describe it for people who've never been here? Mr. BEUTTLER: This is the central ceremonial space in the Capitol. It's a shared space with House and Senate and a lot of the - the kind of national honor ceremonies are here. This is where Rosa Parks, for example, about three years ago, lie in honor after her death in 2005. MARTIN: I mean, this place is just filled with history. I mean, we passed statues of many many notables, and I see in the corner a statue of Martin Luther King, Jr. But it's my understanding that there was not a statue of any African-Americans here for quite sometime. Mr. BEUTTLER: Well, this is the only statue of an African-American in the entirety of the Capitol. Congress, during the Civil War, decided to create what they called National Statuary Hall and invite each state to submit two statues. But no state had chosen, up to this point, an African-American. And Congress realized that the problem with that - and I want to tell you another story about how this rotunda works, too. But in 1982, Congress commissioned, actually, a contest for a statue to honor Martin Luther King. And finally, on his birthday in 1986, the statue was unveiled just about the same time, couple of days before the first Martin Luther King holiday. MARTIN: Oh, wow. Great. Mr. BEUTTLER: So that was done by an act of Congress. MARTIN: OK. Tell me a little bit about some of the paintings along the wall. Mr. BEUTTLER: One of the things in the rotunda, you have eight large paintings memorializing important events in - from the Declaration of Independence all the way up to Washington. But there's no painting of an African-American at all in the rotunda. If you look above, there is - the top portion of the dome is the apotheosis of Washington - Washington is sort of being raised up in the heaven, and that was done by Constantino Brumidi. After that, he starts painting the American history frieze that goes all the way around the inside of the Capitol, and it starts in the center, and the first image is of Columbus discovering America. Then it goes all the way around with significant events in American history, like, for example, William Penn's treaty with the Indians. But then, we really... MARTIN: But there's no acknowledgment of slavery. Mr. BEUTTLER: But there's no acknowledgment... MARTIN: There's no acknowledgment of the institution of slavery... Mr. BEUTTLER: At all. MARTIN: Remarkable, given the fact that even as this building was being raised, enslaved people were doing it. So they were disappeared from the very project that they laid their hands on. Mr. BEUTTLER: And so you have the whole rotunda built by slaves from the floor all the way to the top. But there's no recognition of African-Americans at all. And the story with Brumidi, as he does his history frieze, he actually ran out of images, and he stopped before he was finished. He left about 31 feet that's open. And so what do you put there? This becomes a very important political question because the next major event is going to be how do you portray the Civil War? And Congress went back and forth, and there was even an image up there temporarily of Lincoln presenting the Emancipation Proclamation to his Cabinet. But if you look up there, it's not there anymore. Instead, what you see is an image done in the 1950s which portrays the Civil war as the shaking of hands between a northern soldier and a southern soldier. MARTIN: Where is it? Mr. BEUTTLER: It's right up - actually, towards the southwest. MARTIN: There's nobody of color. There's no black people in it. Those are all white people. Mr. BEUTTLER: Right. Those are all white people. And so, the most important event in American history - emancipation, freedom - is not portrayed on the history paintings in the entirety of the Capitol or entirety of the Capitol rotunda. And Congress realized that, and that's why they commissioned the statue for Martin Luther King... MARTIN: Wow... Mr. BEUTTLER: But there are other things that they have done in order to memorialize it. And that actually became a political controversy a couple of years ago in the 110th Congress. And two congressmen - one a northerner, the other a southerner, one an African-American, one white, one a Republican, one Democrat - actually pointed to the fact that there was no images other than the statue of Martin Luther King in the Capitol rotunda. And they said, we have to have some way to memorialize this. And so they were the ones to actually have a bill to sponsor to change the name of the main space in the visitor center to be Emancipation Hall. MARTIN: On Tuesday - on January 28th, of course, as always, Barack Obama will be sworn in. He will be, of course, our first African-American president. As an historian, of course, you spend a lot of time thinking about events in the past. But what it's like for you to be here as you see history being made right now? Mr. BEUTTLER: It's just an incredible opportunity and an incredible honor to be here and to watch history take place because we came up the east front, and I remember the east front of the Capitol. I'm from Illinois. That's Lincoln's spot, and the first inauguration of Lincoln was there with the Bible that Mr. Obama is going to be holding in the second inauguration. That great inaugural address that Lincoln gave was on the east front, and now we'll get to see it on the west front with the first African-American president. And to be there to watch that is one of the most important events in American history. So finally, to link between, again, Mr. Obama from Illinois and Lincoln from Illinois, to have that connection, and to me coming - as a historian from Illinois is an incredible honor, incredible opportunity, yeah. MARTIN: Fred Beuttler is the deputy historian of the House. I thank you so much for taking the time. Mr. BEUTTLER: Well, thank you.

While a reflection of the times, the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights, were meant to apply to a narrowly defined few and if white women or property-less white men were not going to be treated as equals under the law, then African Americans, whether free or slave, certainly would not either.So, when it came time to construct the U.S. Capitol, a building that would house both chambers of the Congress—a body that was meant to embody and represent the people—it was to be built by slave labor, as was the White House. There is no denying the sad history of this country and slavery; nor can one deny the irony of having the American symbol of freedom and democracy, the United States Capitol, built by many of whom were considered three-fifths of a human being in our Constitution.The legacy of slavery is still one this country is coming to terms with, but it is something that must continually be studied and acknowledged so that we can fully embrace our history, learn from the mistakes of our past, and move forward toward a better future for all Americans. This mini-unit seeks to help in achieving those goals and focuses on the story of the slaves who helped build the Capitol over its construction history from 1793 to 1863, and the overall issue of slavery in the United States during that same period.Objectives: Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:Essential and Content Questions: Teachers and students should answer these before and after the lesson to help gauge prior student knowledge, as well as a means to assess what they learned afterward.Activities and Procedures: All or some of these activities can be done and all can be adjusted depending on age group, level of prior knowledge, make up of class, etc.Upon completing the 3 to 4 day lesson on slavery and the Capitol, teachers may like to give a test or quiz of some kind to measure and assess student learning, though perhaps two alternative assessments to consider would be a paper or a class debate.The paper could be a reflective piece or a research-based one that asks students to examine one of the several paradoxes or ironies within the lesson—slaves building the Capitol, Philip Reid casting the Statue of Freedom—and do an in-depth analysis of the factors and issues surrounding it, or perhaps just a straight reflection paper that goes over their overall impressions of the lessons within the mini-unit. Another paper option would be to have them answer one of the essential questions for the unit in the context of the issues discussed in the lessons. Regardless of which paper option you choose, if you choose one, students should be graded on grammar, spelling, structure and organization, as well as content, research, persuasiveness, and articulation and understanding of arguments and issues at play.For a class debate, you could simply divide the class into members of Congress—Northern and Southern, pro- and anti-slavery alike—and have them debate the issue of slavery in America in the 1850’s. Each side would have designated roles and each side would have to present arguments from the time, using both primary and secondary sources, to assist them in doing so. You can decide what specific issues they should be addressing, but once the arguments are made, they should try and work to resolve the main issue, but do so from the perspective of the time in which they are supposed to be arguing. How do they move forward on the issue of slavery in the Union or do they resolve that war is the only option? Students should be graded on their speaking ability and performance, but especially on the content and persuasiveness of their arguments.

I certainly wasn't taught that not only were many of our presidents slave owners, but that the most renowned building in our nation was, in part, built by slave labor.Unlike at the U.S. Capitol Building and the site of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, there's nothing at the White House that acknowledges its slave history, and perhaps a million each year visit the site, Lusane added.[If Michelle Obama ran for office, Democrats would roll the ‘red carpet’ out for her]While the history of slavery at the White House isn't widely known, historians say there's no debate about the accuracy of the first lady's comments.Even Fox News host Bill O'Reilly partially agreed with Obama, acknowledging on The O'Reilly Factor Tuesday that her statement about slave labor at the White House was essentially correct, according to Media Matters. But O'Reilly disagreed with the first lady's framing, telling his viewers that enslaved peoples at the site were were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government, which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802.He also noted that there were white laborers working on the site as well.O'Reilly also failed to cite and historical records to bolster his claims about the humane treatment of people whose very existence was by definition inhumane.The White House Historical Association’s website says that when planners struggled to recruit European labor, they “turned to African Americans — enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.”Construction on the president's home, the site notes, began in 1792.The precise number of enslaved people forced to work during the multiyear construction is unknown, but Lusane told The Post that his research shows enslaved workers were extensively involved in the effort to develop Washington at the end of the 18th century.We know quite a bit, including the names of a number of the people who were enslaved. Some of them were skilled laborers, such as those who worked in carpentry or masonry, he told The Post. We have the payment records from the people who owned them.The White House Historical Association said slaves were trained at the government’s quarry in Aquia, Va., to cut the stone that was later laid by Scottish masons to create the walls of the president's house. The construction force included white laborers from Maryland and Virginia and immigrants from Ireland and Scotland, the association added.The construction process forced enslaved people to endure backbreaking labor, Lusane said, such as cutting down trees, dredging swamps, removing dirt and rocks and bringing materials to the site from distant rock quarries.[Michelle Obama may be the only person on Earth that Donald Trump won’t attack. But why?]There would have been a sizable number of enslaved people involved, Lusane added. They were building the city as a whole. It took 10 years, and you can be pretty sure that given the work — and the possibility of injuries, diseases, and accidents — that people died.In 2005, PolitiFact noted, a congressional task force issued a report, entitled History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol, that found plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction.Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the capitol, PolitiFact reported. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for 'Negro hire,' a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves.The task force concluded that nobody will ever know the precise number of slaves used in the construction process, but it found that the brutal labor closely resembled the kind used in the construction of the White House. From PolitiFact:In an interview with C-Span in 2011, Lusane detailed the intimate and coercive relationship many of the nation's early leaders had with the people they kept in bondage. In his book, he tells the story of Oney Judge, a woman enslaved by President Washington who managed to escape. Washington attempted to organize her kidnapping, Lusane said, but Judge — who was living as a free woman in New Hampshire at the time — eluded her former master and would eventually learn to read and live into her 80s.Her decision to escape the grip of the nation's first president, she would later tell interviewers, was inspired by the American Revolution, Lusane said.Hundreds of years later, Lusane told The Post, stories like Judge's do not feature prominently in American history because of our insistence on presenting presidents in a positive light.And yet, he noted, their physical legacy remains.As it turns out, slaves became extremely skilled because they did the work around the plantations, around the farms. All of the large structures that were built up and down the East Coast — from libraries to universities to city halls to mansions — were built by slave labor. That meant people had carpentry skills, masonry skills, even some architectural and design skills.The first lady brought some of that legacy alive Monday night, correcting a historical record in a way that historians like Lusane would like to see memorialized at the White House so that the nation can finally move forward.What struck me was that her remarks were unique in terms of the perspective of a woman of color, he said. It's hard to imagine someone who was not a woman of color giving that particular speech. She did it in a way that was perfectly toned, and she talks about the country addressing issues of difference without exacerbating those issues.It's a history lesson that is so valuable, he added.How Bernie Sanders supporters convinced the Democratic Party to get rid of most superdelegatesDonald Trump’s explanation of when he’ll walk away from military partners, annotatedWhy Republicans are hammering Democrats for not mentioning the Islamic State last night",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/26/the-ugly-truth-about-the-white-house-and-its-history-of-slavery/,

Skilled labor was hard to find or attract to the fledgling city. Enslaved laborers, who were rented from their owners, were involved in almost every stage of construction. The federal government relied heavily on enslaved labor to ensure the new capital city would be ready to receive Congress when it moved to Washington from Philadelphia in 1800.To commemorate the role that slave labor played in the construction of the Capitol Building, House Concurrent Resolution 135 was passed by Congress directing the Architect of the Capitol to design, procure and install a slave labor marker in a prominent location in Emancipation Hall. The design and location incorporated the recommendations developed by the Congressional Slave Labor Task Force Working Group.The marker features a single block of Aquia Creek sandstone, which was originally part of the Capitol’s East Front Portico, presented on a platform clad in Cedar Tavernalle marble. The original chisel marks on the sandstone are in view so visitors can see the physical effort required to hew the stone. A hole in the top of the stone was cut to receive a lifting ring used to raise the stone out of the quarry. A bronze plaque is centered on the presentation wall, with an inscription approved by Congress, acknowledging the efforts of all who worked on the Capitol Building. The inscription reads:THIS SANDSTONE WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL’S EAST FRONT, CONSTRUCTED IN 18-24-1826. IT WAS QUARRIED BY LABORERS, INCLUDING ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS, AND COMMEMORATES THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE IN BUILDING THE CAPITOL.Although the entire contribution of enslaved African Americans in the construction of the Capitol Building cannot be determined due the scarcity of documentation, there is enough information to know that the role they played had a significant impact on the project.The site of the new capital city was located in an area that had few carpenters, bricklayers, stone cutters and other tradesmen necessary to construct such a project. Engineers and architects were brought in from other areas, but the majority of the work fell upon the laborers in the area, who were comprised mostly of African American slaves. These slaves, as well as other the laborers, quarried the stone used for the floors, walls and columns of the Capitol, sawed both wood and stone, and became skilled in brick making and laying. Carpentry was also one of the more significant contributions slaves made to the construction of the Capitol as they framed the roof and installed its shingle covering.One of the most significant contributions by an African American slave was made by Philip Reid, who deciphered the puzzle of how to separate the five-piece plaster model of the Statue of Freedom. Today, he and countless others are recognized for the role they played in building this monumental and historic symbol of democracy.The marker is located towards the western end of the northern wall of Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) where it is bathed in sunlight for a portion of each day and will not interfere with visitor flow. The intensity of the daylight will enhance the visibility of tool marks on the presentation stone.The marker is open to all visitors to the CVC, where visitors can learn more about the Capitol Building and its history.",https://www.aoc.gov/art/other/slave-labor-commemorative-marker,

Michelle Obama's description of her daughters playing on the lawn of a White House built by slaves struck a chord with some listeners — a poignant reminder of the historical significance of Barack Obama's serving as the country's first black president. While the White House is often referred to as the people's house, when construction began on the presidential residence in 1792, it was indeed slave labor that helped build it. This fact has popped up as a subject of interest over the years, and the White House Historical Association has a web page on the topic, with the headline ""Did Slaves Build the White House?"" ""The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states — Virginia and Maryland — ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings,"" according to the website. D.C. commissioners, according to the association, ""charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president,"" initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. But recruitment was dismal. They then turned to African-Americans — ""enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol and other early government buildings."" For the raw materials needed to construct the building, a stonemason, Collen Williamson, ""trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry"" in Virginia, according to the association. Immigrants were also part of the crews that built the White House. ""The slaves joined a workforce that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland and other European nations,"" the association website states. The payroll to slaveowners shows that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them from their masters. Slave carpenters Ben, Daniel, and Peter were noted as owned by James Hoban.more + The White House has undergone numerous renovations over the years — it was heavily damaged during the War of 1812, was expanded in 1902 and underwent a reconstruction in the early 1950s — many of which took place after the Civil War and the end of slavery in the United States. But as Michelle Obama pointed out in her speech, slaves first helped build the residence where the first African-American first family has lived for the past 7 1/2 years.",http://abcnews.go.com/US/fact-checking-lady-michelle-obamas-speech-white-house/story?id=40887848,

Her powerful comment about the White House made more than a few people wonder. As a brickmason, I always envisioned stonemasons from the guild — likely Scottish- or German-born men — up there on the scaffold, doing the secret Masonic handshake thing, already plotting government infiltration. The fact-checking came immediately. “Yes, slaves did help build the White House,” said a New York Times headline in a story. That article, among others, quoted the White House Historical Association indicating that slaves, free blacks and even paid slaves joined white laborers and tradesmen from Maryland, Virginia, Scotland, Ireland and elsewhere on the construction crews. Of course, my friends, the White House, the U.S. Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court were the new kids on the block back then. They came after — and borrowed their Roman style from — our amazingly historic Virginia Capitol, masterminded by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson proudly told James Madison that he wanted Virginia’s Capitol to be copied as “an object and proof of national good taste,” said Mark Greenough, our Capitol tour supervisor and historian. The question at hand: Did slaves help build ours, too? As it turns out, Greenough said, a lot of people have been asking that very question for a good while now. But none more than Kathleen Kilpatrick, curator of Capitol Square and executive director of the Capitol Square Preservation Council. “I have been digging for a while,” she said, “trying to pin down the issue of slaves and free-black labor in the construction of the Capitol.” For years, she has been fuming that it has been labeled as the Capitol of the Confederacy, according to its official 1960 U.S. Park Service National Historic Landmark designation. She’s been laboring to rewrite that designation “to fully reflect the scope of its history” and, of course, to get its name changed. So, from deep in the bowels of the state library came the box of billing and accounts for the construction project that began in 1785 and continued until 1798 (although our statesmen started pounding the gavel inside in 1788). Imagine a giant-size version of your shoebox record for your home, all jumbled up and written in 1700s script. And imagine Richmond at the time: “A rough-and-ready waterfront village,” as Kilpatrick described it. The billing records often just showed “an amount, a name and maybe what it’s for.” So they had to dust off city census records and tax rolls and check the names to figure out occupation to extrapolate the services provided. Since some of the tradespeople were slave owners, it’s likely their slaves worked beside them, Kilpatrick said. And there was direct proof in the vouchers: For example, in September 1788 a voucher authorized the payment of “a sum of 20 pounds for the hire of Negros” payable to Robert Goode. Later that fall, a W. Elliot was paid “15 shillings for five days work of his Negro man making up mortar for plastering the outside of the Capitol.” Payments were made to “the negro man Daniel for his services in setting stones.” Another voucher noted payment to “negro Fortune.” There are so many other “intriguing hints,” said Kilpatrick, showing the extensive role slaves and free blacks likely played in building this most historic Capitol. Jefferson, a slave owner himself, probably had a different vision for the crew that would build his soon-to-be-copied building. As Greenough notes, the Virginia Capitol was “the first Roman temple-style public building in the Western Hemisphere.” If Jefferson could’ve had exactly what he wanted, Greenough said, he would have had European masons and woodworkers to nail down that Roman look. But there weren’t a whole lot of them among the hundreds of people wandering the few streets of Richmond back then. Instead, Greenough said, it was likely a mix of local and traveling tradespeople who joined the slaves and free blacks to get ‘er done. (It’s not made of stone but of thick brick walls that were stuccoed and scored to look like stone.) Some of those same itinerant workers could well have been on the crews who later built our beautiful U.S. Capitol and White House. It’s fascinating and crucial shared history, painstakingly compiled by Kilpatrick and others in the lengthy draft of the U.S. National Historic Landmark designation that will hopefully soon be part of the official record for this, the first state Capitol built in America after the Revolutionary War.",http://www.richmond.com/news/holmberg-th-century-vouchers-show-slaves-helped-build-virginia-capitol/article_c1034222-b23c-55e9-93cd-e3e1ce41e54a.html,

We don’t see them…and no one knows them well. It is for this reason that a sandstone marker was dedicated in the Capitol Visitor Center: to honor those enslaved laborers who built our Capitol one stone at a time, but whose names we do not know and whose statues we do not see.During her speech at the dedication of the Capitol Visitor Center on December 2, 2008, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said, “The Capitol was built by slaves…this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009…the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator.” There is astonishingly little known of the enslaved laborers who constructed the Capitol, mostly because early record-keepers were indifferent to common laborers, so records concerning them are incomplete.In 2005, Congress appointed a task force specifically to research this subject. While it was unable to identify many of the slaves who would have begun their work in 1793, the task force reported that slaves were involved in all aspects of the Capitol’s construction, from carpentry and masonry to glazing and painting, and especially the labor-intensive sawing of logs and stones. Life would have been lonely and bleak for these slaves, many residing in rural Virginia, as they worked from sunrise to sunset.The sandstone marker was taken from the Capitol’s East Front portico and placed in the Visitor Center after legislation passed calling for a marker to recognize the contributions of enslaved laborers. At its 2012 dedication, Pelosi further remarked, “For too long the sacrifice of men and women who built this temple of democracy were overlooked; their toil forgotten; their story ignored or denied, and their voices silenced in the pages of history.”The sandstone marker serves as a memorial of respect for these silenced laborers.Editor’s note: Former USCHS staffer and 2013 Capitol Fellow Felicia Bell did significant research on the enslaved laborers who built the Capitol.

In his address, he spoke about the historic monuments and structures surrounding the crowd in Washington, D.C. and paid homage to those who built them. AMY GOODMAN: What Vice President-elect Joe Biden didn’t mention is that many of those buildings were built by slaves. Indeed, as the first African American president in US history, Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and two daughters, Malia and Sasha, will be taking up residence in the White House, a house built by slaves. Michelle Obama and her daughters are descendants of slaves. The Capitol, too, was built by slaves, as was the Supreme Court.Last night, I spoke with AP reporter Jesse Holland. He’s the author of Black Men Built the Capitol: Discovering African-American History In and Around Washington, D.C.JESSE HOLLAND: Standing out there in front of the US Capitol will be Barack Obama, who will become the most powerful man in the United States, an African American president. But he is going to be standing in front of a building that was created and built by some of the least powerful people in the United States: African American slaves.  Through research, we’ve been able to determine that just about 400 of the more than 600 people who worked on the construction of the Capitol were African American slaves. Maybe another fifty or so were African American freedmen. These are people who had their papers to signify that they were free. So the entire building, the center of democracy in the United States, was created by African American slaves.  AMY GOODMAN: And the documents that prove this?  JESSE HOLLAND: The reason why we know this for a fact is because the federal government rented slaves from plantations in Virginia, Maryland and in the District of Columbia. The government had to write receipts for the use of these slaves, and those receipts still exist at the National Archives in the Library of Congress. Through meticulous searching through those archives, we’ve been able to determine, almost precisely, that just about 400 of the workers who created the US Capitol were slaves.  JESSE HOLLAND: This was in the — the construction of the Capitol began in the early 1700s, and it finished directly before the Civil War. Actually, one of the better stories comes at that time directly before the Civil War. To complete the Capitol, they wanted to put a statue on top of the Capitol Dome, and an American art student in Paris wins the competition and creates the Statue of Freedom, a statue that today sits on top of the Dome. He takes a picture of the statue, and he sends it back to the United States, and it wins the competition.  But the person in charge of the construction of the Capitol at that time was the secretary of war, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, who would go on to be the president of the Confederacy. Well, when Jefferson Davis saw the picture of the Statue of Freedom, he threatened to cancel the entire project. The reason why is because Thomas Crawford, the art student who created the Statue of Freedom, had placed on top of the Statue of Freedom what was called a liberty cap. Well, Jefferson Davis was a student of Roman history, and he knew what a liberty cap signified. What a liberty cap tells the world is that that person wearing the liberty cap is a freed slave. So what Thomas Crawford wanted to put on top of the Capitol was a statue of a freed slave. But when Jefferson Davis sees this, he goes ballistic. He says he is not going to put a picture — a statue of a freed slave on top of the US Capitol. And he tells Thomas Crawford that “you either change the statue, or we’re going to cancel the entire project.”  Well, Crawford is an art student, and he needed the commission money. But the only thing he did was he took off the liberty cap and put on an American eagle helmet. So when most people look at that Statue of Freedom, when they see the Statue of Freedom behind Barack Obama on Inauguration Day, most people are going to think that that’s a statue of a Native American. No, it’s actually a statue of a freed slave with an American eagle helmet on top.  JESSE HOLLAND: That same story continues. Philip Reid was an African American slave from Charleston, South Carolina. He was brought up to Washington, D.C. by his master, Clark Mills, who was a famous ironworker in Washington, D.C. We know Clark Mills today, because he was commissioned and created the statue of General Lafayette that sits in front of the White House, which is why the park in front of the White House is known as Lafayette Park. Well, he buys Philip Reid out of Charleston, South Carolina and brings him up to Washington, D.C. Clark Mills gets the contract to bronze the Statue of Freedom.  Well, when Thomas Crawford finally gets the completed finished designs for the Statue of Freedom, he creates a life-size model out of plaster. He takes apart this plaster model into five different pieces, and he puts it on a ship for America. Now, unfortunately, Thomas Crawford dies before the statue reaches American shores. But luckily, he had put on that ship with the Statue of Freedom an Italian workman, whose only job was to take these five pieces of the statue apart and put the pieces back together and not break them, because they were made out of plaster. Well, the statue comes across the Atlantic, up the Potomac, and is put together in the space between the Capitol and where the Supreme Court is now. And people from all around Washington, D.C. come to the Capitol, and they see this plaster model, this eighty-foot plaster model of what the Statue of Freedom is going to look like. And everyone goes, “Ooh! Aah! What a wonderful statue!”  Well, it’s at this point the Italian workman has an idea. He tells the Capitol commissioners that the person who created this statue is dead. So you can’t make another copy of it. There’s only one person on this entire continent who knows how to take this plaster statue apart without breaking it, and that’s him. So he tells the government that if they don’t pay him three times his agreed-upon wages, he’s going to refuse to take the statue back apart. Well, the government didn’t take well to that ultimatum. So they decided that they would just let that statue sit on the ground between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.  Well, Clark Mills had won the contract to bronze the Statue of Freedom, so he really needed to get that statue, that plaster model apart without breaking it. So he asked around, and the only person who had the skills to take that plaster statue apart was Philip Reid. What he did was he tied a rope to the top of the statue, and he threw the rope over the top of a tall tree, and he put three or four strong men at the end of the rope and told them to pull. As the statue slowly rose off the ground, the four separators between the five pieces opened just a crack, and they were able to see inside the statue and figure out how to take it apart without breaking it. So, if not for an African American slave named Philip Reid, the Statue of Freedom might still be sitting on the ground between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.  But the story doesn’t even end there. Clark Mills gets those five pieces of the Statue of Freedom out to his foundry in Bladensburg, Maryland. Now, his job was to get this statue bronzed by the time construction on the Capitol was complete. So he had a deadline. The controversy with the Italian workman had lost him a lot of time off of his schedule. So it’s now a rush job. So that’s when the foreman of the foundry, of Clark Mill’s foundry, has an idea. He says, “Mr. Mills, you now have to get this job done quickly, and you have to get it done right. And the only person who could run this foundry the way it should be run, and the only person who can get this job done the way it should be done is me. So, Mr. Mills, you’re going to pay me three times my agreed-upon salary.” So what did Clark Mills do? He fires him. And then he looks around and says, “Who can run this factory — who can run this foundry the way it should be run? Who can get this job done on time? Who can lead these ironworkers into bronzing this statue?” The only person he could find to do it correctly was, once again, Philip Reid. So an African American slave was the person put in charge of bronzing the Statue of Freedom. Now, that’s irony for you: a slave is a person in charge of bronzing the Statue of Freedom that’s going on top of the Capitol. And, well, the job was done on time and under budget.AMY GOODMAN: Jesse Holland is an Associated Press reporter. We’re going to come back to his description of Washington, D.C. and who built it. His new book is called Black Men Built the Capitol: Discovering African-American History In and Around Washington, D.C. Stay with us.We continue with the Associated Press reporter who joined us in studio last night to describe Washington, D.C. Jesse Holland is author of Black Men Built the Capitol: Discovering African-American History In and Around Washington D.C. AMY GOODMAN: Jesse Holland, before we get to the White House and who built the White House, you mentioned the Supreme Court. And you’re going to be, in the next few days, Associated Press’s Supreme Court correspondent.  AMY GOODMAN: But can you tell us who built the Supreme Court?  JESSE HOLLAND: Now, where the Supreme Court sits today used to be a building called the Old Brick Capitol. Now, the connection between African Americans and the Supreme Court is this. The slave market in Washington, D.C. was so robust before the Civil War that slave owners in the District of Columbia didn’t have enough space to keep the slaves they were buying and selling. So what they did was they rented public jail space. Now, after the War of 1812, the Capitol was burned. Congress built a new capitol in Washington, D.C. called the Old Brick Capitol. That building sat exactly where the Supreme Court is now. Well, after the Capitol was rebuilt, Congress moved back across the street into their own building, and the Old Brick Capitol was turned into a public jail. So, African American slaves were kept in jail cells on the site that the Supreme Court sits on today. The highest court in the land sits on a spot where African American slaves were kept in jail as they were waiting to be sold.  AMY GOODMAN: Because their so-called owners rented the space?  JESSE HOLLAND: They rented public jail space and held African American slaves in those spaces.  AMY GOODMAN: And this auction, this market of human beings, was on what is now the National Mall?  JESSE HOLLAND: There are several sites on the National Mall where African American slaves were bought and sold. For example, directly in between where the Department of Education sits today and where the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum is now used to be a slave market called Robey’s Tavern. Just a block or so toward the Tidal Basin from there was another one called the Yellow House.  The reason why we know those two were there is because an African American free man from New York came down to Washington on vacation and was kidnapped and sold as a slave in the Yellow House, which was in that area between the Robey’s Tavern and — the Robey’s Tavern and the Yellow House were the two slave markets that were between the Department of Education and the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. He was sold down to New Orleans as a slave, but six years later he escaped back up north and ends up writing his autobiography, where he tells about the slave markets that were on the National Mall within sight of the US Capitol.  They were all — you can just go all up and down the Mall. Where the National Archives sits, right on the parade route for the inauguration tomorrow, was another slave market, where African Americans were sold. On the Tidal Basin, where everyone comes in the springtime to see all the cherry blossoms, there were slave markets all in Potomac Park. So as you go all up and down the National Mall, you walk across sites where African American slaves were bought and sold.  AMY GOODMAN: Jesse Holland, we’re about to see the First Family, the first African American family, take up residence in the White House. A house built by slaves?  JESSE HOLLAND: A house built by African American slaves. Pierre L’Enfant, the person who designed Washington, D.C., included in his original plans a Congress house, which is the Capitol, and the President’s house, which is the White House. Pierre L’Enfant went to the city commissioners and asked them to find him some African American slaves to dig the foundation that the White House sits on today. African American slaves sawed the lumber. They baked the bricks. They quarried the marble.  James Hoban, the actual architect of the White House, brought up with him from South Carolina some of his own personal slaves that were used in building the building. The reason why we know this is because James Hoban paid himself for the use of his own slaves on his project and wrote himself receipts. So this is why we know that these workers —-  AMY GOODMAN: So he charged the government for their labor.  JESSE HOLLAND: He charged the government for the labor of his own slaves on a project he was getting paid for. So this is why we know African American slaves were used outside the White House.  African American slaves were also used inside the White House, starting from Thomas Jefferson up until just about the Civil War. African American slaves were used as domestic staff inside the White House, from their slave-owning presidents. They didn’t want to pay a White House domestic staff, so they would just bring slaves from their plantations to live inside the White House. In fact, what’s now known as the first floor of the White House used to be the basement. There used to be a slave quarters there. So where the oval diplomatic room is in the White House today, used to be slave quarters. AMY GOODMAN: And how did it get changed? JESSE HOLLAND: Well, the White House was completely burned in the War of 1812. So a lot of the original work that was done on the White House by African American slaves has been lost. Now, we believe that African American slaves were also used in the reconstruction of the White House, but we have not found any receipts to prove this. But we know they were used in the original construction. But we only believe they were used in the reconstruction after the War of 1812. We just can’t prove it.  JESSE HOLLAND: Paul Jennings. Paul Jennings was one of those slaves who actually lived inside the White House. He was the property of James Madison. Now -— JESSE HOLLAND: President James Madison. Now, it’s because of Paul Jennings that we know the legend of Dolly Madison pulling down the painting of George Washington and fleeing before the British arrived is not true. Paul Jennings actually wrote an autobiography, one of the first tell-all books about White House life. And in his book, Paul Jennings says an African American slave and a white gardener, who lived and worked in the White House, were the people who actually saved the painting of George Washington from the British troops from being burned in the White House with British troops.  Paul Jennings also was one of the instigators and one of the leaders of one of the mass — one of the largest mass slave escapes in United States history. After the Madisons — after President James Madison died, and his wife, Dolly Madison, was left behind, she sold Paul Jennings to Senator Daniel Webster. Jennings continued to live in Washington, D.C. And he was the ringleader of a group of African American slaves and African American freedmen and freedwomen who got together and found — and found about seventy African American slaves, organized them and put them on a ship called the Pearl and escaped Washington, D.C., up the Potomac toward Point Lookout, Maryland.  Unfortunately for them, the Pearl was a wind-powered ship, and when they got to the mouth of the Potomac, the wind died. Well, they had made their escape in the dead of night. When morning came, the slave owners found out that their slaves were missing. And they got on a steam-powered ship and got after them and corralled them and caught all of these slaves in Point Lookout, Maryland, and brought them back to Washington, D.C. Well, everyone on the ship, whether they were a African American freedman or an African American slave, was sold South.  But luckily for Paul Webster, he wasn’t on the ship. At the very last second, he decided that since he had made an agreement with Daniel Webster to work for him a certain amount of years, and perhaps then he would be able to buy his freedom, he decided that to escape would be breaking his word. So as the Pearl was getting ready to leave Washington, D.C., Paul Jennings gets off, goes back to Daniel Webster’s house, finds the letter that he had written to Senator Webster telling him his plans for escape and destroys it. So, Paul Jennings was able to escape detection in the escape of the Pearl and was one of the ringleaders in trying to buy some of those African American free families and some of the slave families back from the South after they were sent there. JESSE HOLLAND: Well, Thomas Jefferson was actually the first US president to bring slaves inside the White House here in Washington. Now, George Washington also owned slaves, and he also kept slaves in the President’s house in Philadelphia and in New York, where the government was operating from during his time. But Thomas Jefferson was the first president to actually hold slaves inside the White House. Well, he wanted the very first White House chef to be a former slave, a man —-  JESSE HOLLAND: The very first White House chef to be a former slave, and that was a man by the name of James Hemings. Well, James Hemings was the brother of Sally Hemings, the alleged mistress of Thomas Jefferson.  AMY GOODMAN: And she was enslaved by him. JESSE HOLLAND: She was enslaved -— his sister was enslaved by Thomas Jefferson. Well, James Hemings also used to be enslaved by Thomas Jefferson. When Jefferson originally went to Paris as an ambassador from the United States, he took James Hemings with him. So, in Paris, Hemings learned how to cook French cuisine, and he became an expert at it. So when Jefferson comes back to America, James Hemings gets the reputation of being an excellent chef at French cuisine. So not only did he cook at Monticello, he starts cooking for other plantations and eventually earns enough money to buy his freedom. Jefferson would only let him buy his freedom on one condition, and that was, James Hemings had to teach someone else at Monticello how to cook French cuisine. So he takes one of his own brothers, teaches him how to cook French cuisine, and then James Hemings buys his freedom and moves to Baltimore.  Well, eventually, Thomas Jefferson becomes president. And he remembers the fine French food that James Hemings cooked. And he sends for him and tells him that he wants him to be the very first White House chef. Hemings says no, because at this time Thomas Jefferson is still holding the majority of James Hemings’s family in slavery. And if he had moved into the White House, James Hemings would have been the only free black man working on a staff made up of just about all African American slaves. So James Hemings tells Thomas Jefferson, “No, I refuse. I don’t want to come work for you.” So, Jefferson goes out and hires a white French chef. So, if you look at Thomas Jefferson’s original White House staff, you have one white chef, and the rest of them are African American slaves. That’s how the tradition of having black domestic workers in the White House began. AMY GOODMAN: And though I said that the Obamas are the first presidential family — African American presidential family, they’re not the first black family to live in the White House.  JESSE HOLLAND: No, from the very beginning of the White House, African American slaves have lived on the White House grounds. Now, the very first president to live there, John Adams, did not hold slaves. In fact, he was a staunch abolitionist. But Thomas Jefferson comes a few years after John Adams and brings in an entire staff of African American slaves. So does James Madison. And the list just goes on and on from there. I believe twelve of the first maybe fourteen presidents to live in the White House held African American slaves there. Almost all the way up until the Civil War, when slaves were freed in the District of Columbia, African Americans worked as butlers, they worked as maids, they worked as gardeners. They worked every domestic job that we’ve been able to look at so far in the White House, except the chief management positions, which were held by white aides. But all of the other domestic jobs at the beginning of the White House were held by African American slaves, who not only worked there, they also lived there in quarters inside the White House.  AMY GOODMAN: You write that in 1806, two of Thomas Jefferson’s slaves had a child in the White House?  JESSE HOLLAND: The very first child to be born in the White House was a grandson —- I mean, a grandnephew of Thomas Jefferson. The second child -— AMY GOODMAN: This is ever — a child in the White House?  JESSE HOLLAND: Ever, ever. The second child ever to be born inside the White House was the child of two of Thomas Jefferson’s slaves. Unfortunately, this child did not live long, because — probably because of the medical condition that slaves were kept in at that time. But the second child to ever be born inside the White House was an African American.  AMY GOODMAN: And Sally Hemings had children by Thomas Jefferson. JESSE HOLLAND: But we have not been able to definitively prove that Sally Hemings was ever inside the White House. And relatives of Thomas Jefferson also dispute whether those are actually Thomas Jefferson’s children, even though Sally Hemings’s relatives say they are.  AMY GOODMAN: And the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery?  JESSE HOLLAND: That’s one of the greatest stories about Washington, D.C. There actually used to be an African American town right on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. When General Robert E. Lee accepted the command of the Confederate forces, he had to leave his home in Arlington, Virginia. His home was actually where Arlington National Cemetery sits today. Well, when Robert E. Lee leaves Arlington for Richmond, Virginia, the federal government confiscates his land. And the way they ensured that Robert E. Lee would never come back is they started burying Union and Confederate soldiers in Robert E. Lee’s front yard. That’s how Arlington National Cemetery got its start.  Well, another thing the federal government did was they gave a part of that land to the freed slaves who used to work for General Lee. So these slaves took that land and started up their own town, and they called it Freedman’s Village. These slaves opened up their own hospitals. They opened up their own stores. They opened up their own schools. Eventually, the work they did was so impressive, other African American slaves who had been freed by the Civil War move up to Washington, D.C. And Freedman’s Village gets bigger and bigger and becomes more and more famous. In fact, one of the people who moved into Freedman’s Village was Sojourner Truth, the famous African American abolitionist.  Well, the Civil War eventually ends, and Lee’s family sues the United States government for the return of their land. They fight it out in court for a while, and the government finally decides they’re going to settle. But what they did after they settled was they kicked off all of the African Americans who lived in Freedman’s Village, paid the population of the entire town $75 for it — $75,000 for all of the work they had done and then destroyed it, destroyed the entire town. They razed the homes, the churches, the schools. They destroyed everything.  So, today, there is very little in Arlington National Cemetery to signify that Freedman’s Village was ever there, except one thing. While the government could destroy the homes, they could destroy the schools, they could destroy the churches, but one thing the government couldn’t do was dig up the people that they had already buried. So, today, in Arlington National Cemetery, if you go over to Section 27 — it’s the section that’s nearest to the Iwo Jima Memorial — you’ll see that that section is all African American and all freed slaves. If you look at the tombstones, a lot of them only have one name on them. “Here lies George.” One will say, “Here was Andrea.” One will say, “Child of John,” because some of the people, when they died, they didn’t even know who they were. But they buried them there, because, at that point, they were free citizens of the United States. Every tombstone says either “citizen” or “civilian,” because when they died, they were free men and free women.AMY GOODMAN: Jesse Holland is author of Black Men Built the Capitol: Discovering African-American History In and Around Washington, D.C. It is January 20th, 2009. The nation is about to inaugurate the forty-fourth president of the United States, the first African American president of the United States. And then his family will move into the White House later today. They will move into the White House built by slaves. Barack Obama’s wife, Michelle Obama, and his daughters, Malia and Sasha, are descendants of slaves. AMY GOODMAN: Bono and U2 at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday in the pre-inaugural concert. About half-a-million people packed into the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, the War and Peace Report. We are broadcasting live from Washington on this day that ends the Bush administration and inaugurates the administration of Barack Hussein Obama. I’m Amy Goodman, joined by Pulitzer Prize-winning author, poet, activist, Alice Walker. Her most recent book is We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting for: Inner Light in a Time of Darkness, she, too, a descendant of slaves. As you listened to Jesse Holland describe the geography, the architecture, the history of this country, Alice, can you talk about your thoughts on this historic day?Well, one of the things that I think about is how I feel that my people were actually not slaves — they were enslaved, and they were still people — and that many of them were determined to be free, no matter how many fetters were placed on their necks and legs and wrists. It is incredibly moving to hear Jesse Holland, and I am so grateful that he has preserved this history for us, because it brings us even closer to our ancestors, the people who worked so hard to make so many things of beauty and durability and the people who worked with so much faith and hope and humor, so that today, when we look around us, we can feel more at home in this world. When you don’t have the history, there is always the possibility of not knowing whether you belong. So we know and feel that we belong when we hear him and we hear the history of our ancestors.As we’re speaking today, Alice, outside, well, it’s expected there will be about two million people. We’re going to show live images now of the crowds outside. We’re getting reports from subway stations, from the Capitol, from many different places right now, of lines, mass lines even around the block just to get into a subway station. There are performances around the city. People are trying to get in who have tickets. And, of course, there are well over a million people who don’t have tickets, who have just come to be a part of this, which I think is very exciting, because in this TV era, when perhaps you can see it better on television, still people want to be a part. Maybe we can call it the post-couch potato age. They want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, which may point to what people will do next, actually being engaged in activism, Alice.Well, I do. I think that people see that they can change things, that they can come together and make something very large, especially when they’re feeling individually that they’re very small and asking the question always, “What can I do? You know, I’m only one person.” But we see now that we can elect a black man as president of the United States. And, in a way, everything after that is, you know, a challenge, but it can be done.",https://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/20/jesse_holland_black_men_built_the,

In fact, the legacy of American presidents owning slaves goes all the way back to George Washington.Twelve American presidents owned slaves and eight of them, starting with Washington, owned slaves while in office. Almost from the very start, slaves were a common sight in the executive mansion. A list of construction workers building the White House in 1795 includes five slaves - named Tom, Peter, Ben, Harry and Daniel -- all put to work as carpenters. Other slaves worked as masons in the government quarries, cutting the stone for early government buildings, including the White House and U.S. Capitol. According to records kept by the White House Historical Association, slaves often worked seven days a week -- even in the hot and humid Washington summers.In 1800, John Adams was the first president to live in the White House, moving in before it was finished. Adams was a staunch opponent of slavery, and kept no slaves. Future presidents, however, didn't follow his lead. Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Adams, wrote that slavery was an assemblage of horrors and yet he brought his slaves with him. Early presidents were expected to pay their household expenses themselves, and many who came from the so-called slave states simply brought their slaves with them.Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant all owned slaves but not during their time in office. James Madison, Jefferson's successor, held slaves all of his life including while he was in office. During the war of 1812 Madison's slaves helped remove material from the White House shortly before the British burned the building. Michelle Obama uncovers slaves in her family »In 1865 one of Madison's former slaves, Paul Jennings, wrote the first White House memoir: A Colored Man's Reminiscences of Life in the White House. In the book, Jennings called Madison one of the best men that ever lived and said Madison never would strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it.There were other presidents who treated their slaves less kindly.James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, John Tyler, James K. Polk and Zachary Taylor all owned slaves while they were in office. The last of these, President Taylor, said owning slaves was a Constitutional right and he said slave-owners like himself would appeal to the sword if necessary to keep them. The Civil War, of course, put that opinion to the test.Now, the Obamas are moving into the White House.The apple cart has been turned over here when you have the Obamas -- the first African-American couple -- now actually management and you are having in some cases white Americans serving them, says presidential historian Doug Brinkley.Michelle Obama learned this year that one of her great-great grandfathers was a slave who worked on a rice plantation in South Carolina. She says finding that part of her past uncovered both shame and pride and what she calls the tangled history of this country.For many, the historic election on November 4 marked a new beginning.Though Michelle Obama's ancestors had to come through the ordeal of slavery, Her children are sleeping in the room of presidents, said Brinkley.

Overall, about a third of Americans live within one of the 50-mile radiuses.",Do You Live Within 50 Miles of a Nuclear Power Plant?,"This is probably not a question you're asked all that often. But it's one worth knowing the answer to for a couple of reasons: the basic value in knowing where some of your electricity comes from and, in the extremely unlikely event of a meltdown, the practical knowledge of whether you'll have to evacuate your home.Currently, if a radiological emergency occurs, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommends that anyone living within 10 miles of a plant to tune in to their local radio or television Emergency Alert System and heed the instructions from state or local officials. The commission also suggests that anyone within 50 miles to take action to protect local food and water supplies. Recently, some have have argued that the evacuation zone should be extended this far as well—and in 2011, after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, authorities from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that Americans living within 50 miles of the plant to evacuate.This is where a new nuclear proximity interactive map by Esri (one of their many cool disaster response maps) comes in handy. Scroll around to see the 65 active nuclear plants scattered across the U.S. surrounded by 10-mile (red) and 50-mile (yellow) radiuses, or plug in your address to get the exact distance you are from the nearest few plants. (Smithsonian.com's office, in case you're wondering, is 44.18 miles from the Calvert Cliffs plant in southern Maryland.) You can also turn on layers that show the locations of historic earthquakes and fault lines.Seeing all the plants laid out on a national map also conveys an interesting point. Because most electricity use is in cities, a nuclear plant (unlike wind or solar) can be built pretty much anywhere, and transmitting electricity over great distances causes some of the energy to be lost to friction, most of the plants are logically located near large urban areas. For better or worse, of the country's biggest 20 metro areas by population, at least part of 14 of them lies within 50 miles of a nuclear plant. Overall, about a third of Americans live within one of the 50-mile radiuses. If you're reading this article somewhere in the U.S., there's a good chance that a nuclear plant is relatively closeby.Editors note: This story was edited to clarify the NRC's emergency preparedness plan for those who live within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant.",http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/do-you-live-within-50-miles-nuclear-power-plant-180950072/,
Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-lawrence-odonnell-most-americans-live-withi/,True,True,True,True,True,True,About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.,MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell: Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant,"On MSNBC's Last Word on March 22, 2011, host Lawrence O'Donnell argued that evacuation plans for nuclear power plants in the United States are an unrealistic fantasy due to the huge population concentrations around them.   That's especially the case, he said, if there were a call to evacuate a 50-mile radius -- the distance the U.S. government recently urged Americans to evacuate around an earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant.  The truth is, most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, O'Donnell said.  O'Donnell and his guest, Daniel Aldrich, author of Site Fights, used the example of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people.  Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves.  Said O'Donnell: There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point.  The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant.  We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one.  According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported.  According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.  They typically build power plants where there are large populations, said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand.  You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high.  So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate.  But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic.  The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory. In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools appeared to be significantly compromised.  She's completely confident the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has extremely good communication with the licensees. They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time.  We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information, she said.  Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply.  While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles.  In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, they tend to put them in the outer suburbs, Milligan said.  Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic.  Evacuations do save lives, Milligan said. They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well.  But back to O'Donnell's statistic. He said most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. That's certainly most.

But turn to the right a bit...The view from the bay window Next door to the Van der Putten family on Millstone Beach in Waterford, Vincent E. McCurdy has a living room full of boxes. His family bought the house in late January for $760,000, moving in just before the Japanese nuclear emergency. He and his wife have a daughter at home and a son away at college.The nuclear plant with the fewest neighbors is Nebraska's Cooper Nuclear Station, in a rural area on the Missouri border, with only 164,000 people within 50 miles.The reactors with the most neighbors within 50 miles:Growth even in slow-growth states Looking at individual nuclear plants, these patterns jump out:No matter what size the circle, the pattern is consistent: Most nuclear plants have growing neighborhoods. Out of the 65 nuclear power plants in the U.S., 55 plants had more people living within 5 miles than a decade earlier; 54 plants had more people within 10 miles; and 56 plants had more people within 50 miles.Other conclusions from the mapping of census data:Most reactors have more neighbors Journalist Andrew Long at Longcreative plotted the 65 nuclear power locations for msnbc.com on a computerized map of the 2000 and 2010 census data, calculating the population within different distances from each plant. (One of the leading nuclear power companies, General Electric, is a part owner of NBCUniversal, which co-owns msnbc.com through a joint venture with Microsoft.)They're in the house somewhere. I'm really not sure where.His family did receive a packet of potassium iodide pills in the mail a while back, because they live within the 10-mile zone.It is what it is, he said. It makes a hissing noise sometimes at night. That rattles the windows. They let us know when they have that scheduled. They let off the steam at night because no one wants to see the plume. It's just an industrial plant.The father of one of the boys, Paul Van der Putten, 49, bought his home in 2003 for $378,000. It has increased roughly 75 percent in value since. He said he isn't worried about the nuclear plant, which is about six-tenths of a mile away, the length of 10 football fields. It has two operating nuclear reactors as well as a third reactor, mothballed but still a storehouse for nuclear fuel rods.And if you turn your head to the right, the orange-and-white-striped tower of the Millstone Power Station reaches high above the white sand. The estimated population within 10 miles of Millstone grew 30 percent in the past decade, to 123,482. The population within 50 miles grew to 3 million, an increase of 10 percent, much faster than the state's general growth rate of 4.9 percent.On a recent spring evening, two boys were shooting hoops in the driveway of a beachfront house on Millstone Beach in Waterford, a Connecticut town on Long Island Sound midway between New York City and Boston. The neat houses look out on glorious sunrises.'It makes a hissing noise' Why would the population rise sharply near nuclear power plants, even in lower-growth states outside the Sun Belt? One reason could be normal population expansion, with previously unoccupied areas being filled in. Another reason: Nuclear reactors use water for cooling, from lakes, rivers or oceans, so the reactors are typically built on waterfront property. Is the sun rising or setting over the ocean any less beautiful if you can also see a cooling tower?To get more information: The interactive map on this story shows the populations within 5, 10, 20 and 50 miles of each nuclear power plant in the U.S. And a ranking of nuclear plants by population is at the bottom of the text, along with a data file for readers who want to do their own analysis.Among the 100 most populous U.S. cities on the new census map, 26 have a nuclear plant within 50 miles: New York, Chicago, Philadelphia (3 different plants nearby), Phoenix, San Diego, Fort Worth, Charlotte (2 plants), Detroit, Baltimore, Boston (2 plants), Washington, Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Omaha, Raleigh and Durham, Miami, Cleveland, Minneapolis and St. Paul (2 plants), New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Toledo (2 plants), Newark, Baton Rouge, and Rochester, N.Y.The population within 10 miles of Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor grew 11 percent. At Pilgrim, outside of Boston, the increase was 41 percent. Near San Onofre on the California fault lines, 50 percent.That's 116 million nuclear neighbors, up from 109 million a decade earlier, according to the analysis conducted for msnbc.com by Longcreative , a data analysis and design company.If the circles on the map are widened to a 50-mile radius (the same evacuation area that U.S. nuclear officials recommended for Americans living near Japan's troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors), they would cover one in three people in the U.S.A new map of data from the 2010 U.S. Census shows that the number of people living within the 10-mile emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants rose by 17 percent in the past decade, compared with an overall increase of less than 10 percent in the U.S. population.Who's afraid of nuclear power? Not the American people, judging by where they choose to live.The plant was definitely way down on the list of considerations.After Fukushima, nuclear power has been more on their minds, he said, but it wouldn't change their decision to choose this location.It's been elevated in terms of thinking about it, but we don't really talk too much about it, because we view the overall risk to be low.McCurdy, 54, is a senior pharmaceutical scientist for Pfizer Inc., and approaches the question with an analytical mind. While he acknowledged there are some risks, The safety record of the nuclear industry has been pretty good overall. Millstone is not near a fault line. Long Island would buffer them against a tsunami. Hurricanes in this area are infrequent and relatively mild. And if something catastrophic were to happen, he said, a nuclear emergency can be slow to develop.You'd have some time to react, to get the family out of town.Growth even outside the Sun Belt Even nuclear plants in low-growth areas of the country showed increases in population. For example, the population in the 10-mile preparedness zone around the Salem and Hope Creek plants, near Hancocks Bridge, N.J., grew by 54 percent. The state population grew just under 5 percent in the same decade.These plants showed the most population growth, judged in percentage terms, using a 10-mile radius: Palo Verde, near Wintersburg, Ariz.; Brunswick, near Southport, N.C.; Calvert Cliffs, near Lusby, Md.; McGuire, near Huntersville, N.C.; Turkey Point, near Homestead, Fla.; and Shearon Harris, near New Hill, N.C. Each of these showed increases of more than 60 percent in a decade, from relatively small base populations in 2000.Any idea that most reactors are in unpopulated areas is not borne out by the data, not when a 50-mile circle is drawn. The median, or middle, nuclear plant has 1.4 million residents within 50 miles. Out of 65 plants, 42 exceed a million people within that 50-mile zone.How close is close? Before Fukushima, people within a mile or two already knew they lived close to nuclear power. At Millstone, the neighborhood and the plant have the same name. The back gate of the plant was usually unlocked until after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Van der Putten said, and workers could walk from the plant to the neighborhood beach to have lunch.Now, with all the talk of evacuation zones in Japan, Americans living 10 or 20 or 50 miles away may be calculating for the first time their distance from a nuclear reactor. In Japan, the evacuation zone has been expanded to 12 miles for everyone, and 12 to 19 miles for children, pregnant women and hospitalized patients.Some critics of nuclear power have said that the standard emergency planning zone for the U.S. should be expanded to 20 or 50 miles. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said it's sticking with 10 miles, but that the zone can always be expanded in an emergency.In Waterford, more than 100 people packed a meeting Monday evening at Town Hall to hear from officials of Dominion, the Virginia energy company that owns the Millstone nuclear plant. Though a few anti-nuclear activists were louder, a larger group of nuclear supporters shouted them down.Dominion executives stressed differences between their plant's design and the troubled reactors in Japan, and emphasized the multiple backup systems and emergency plans. (See this PDF file for a typical set of emergency instructions for a nuclear power plant.) Among other differences, Millstone has pressurized-water reactors, not the boiling-water reactors used in Fukushima and in many U.S. plants. Dominion's main current concern is not fear but taxation: A proposed state tax in Connecticut would hit nuclear power hardest of all. Dominion has threatened to close the plant if the $335 million tax increase is approved and it can't pass the cost on to customers.Judging by interviews in the neighborhoods, and conversation at the Main Street Grille in the village of Niantic, which has the best view of the plant, residents are less worried by the nuclear emergency than by another emergency just up the road in Boston: Two weeks into the baseball season, the Red Sox are in last place.More than half of Americans polled say nuclear power is safe Gallup, the polling organization, has asked two main questions on nuclear power.Americans are divided on the question of construction of more nuclear power plants. In late March, with Japan very much in the news, 46 percent of those surveyed told Gallup that nuclear power is necessary to help solve the nation's current energy problems, while 48 percent said the dangers of nuclear power are too great, even if it would help solve energy problems. That's very nearly the same split as 10 years earlier.On the issue of safety, there is a clear pro-nuclear majority: In the same Gallup poll in late March, 58 percent said that nuclear power plants are safe, while only 36 percent said they are not safe, with 6 percent expressing no opinion.Gallup's editor in chief, Frank Newport, summarized: It may be months or years before the final impact of the Japanese disaster on American attitudes toward nuclear power can be assessed. In the short term, Americans are concerned about the dangers of a nuclear crisis in this country. But Gallup's most recent survey suggests that support for nuclear power may be more stable than some might think.Ranking of U.S. nuclear plants by population within 50 miles These are the 65 commercial nuclear power plants in the United States, showing the estimated U.S. populations within 10 and 50 miles, the changes in population between 2000 and 2010, and distances to selected larger cities within 50 miles. These 65 locations have 104 operating nuclear reactors. Several of the reactors also would have nearby Canadian residents, who are not counted here.The plants are ranked here by population within 50 miles.More information: This information is summarized on the accompanying map, and more details on each plant and its population changes are available in an Excel spreadsheet.1 Indian Point, near Buchanan, N.Y., two reactors, licensed 1973/1976, 2010 population within 50 miles is 17,220,895 (increase of 5.1 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 272,539 (increase of 17.6 percent), cities within 50 miles include New York (41 miles to city center); Newark, N.J., (39 miles); Stamford, Conn., (24 miles); Bridgeport, Conn., (40 miles).2 San Onofre, near San Clemente, Calif., two reactors, licensed 1982/1983, 2010 population within 50 miles is 8,460,508 (increase of 14.9 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 92,687 (increase of 50.0 percent), cities within 50 miles include San Diego (45 miles).3 Limerick, near Limerick, Pa., two reactors, licensed 1985/1989, 2010 population within 50 miles is 8,027,924 (increase of 6.1 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 252,197 (increase of 18.7 percent), cities within 50 miles include Philadelphia (28 miles).4 Dresden, near Morris, Ill., two reactors, licensed 1969/1971, 2010 population within 50 miles is 7,305,482 (increase of 3.5 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 83,049 (increase of 47.6 percent), cities within 50 miles include Chicago (43 miles).5 Peach Bottom, near Delta, Pa., two reactors, licensed 1973/1974, 2010 population within 50 miles is 5,526,342 (increase of 10.6 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 46,536 (increase of 7.2 percent), cities within 50 miles include Baltimore (36 miles).6 Hope Creek, near Hancocks Bridge, N.J, one reactor, licensed 1986, 2010 population within 50 miles is 5,523,010 (increase of 7.5 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 53,811 (increase of 53.3 percent), cities within 50 miles include Philadelphia (43 miles).7 Salem, near Hancocks Bridge, N.J, two reactors, licensed 1976/1981, 2010 population within 50 miles is 5,482,329 (increase of 7.6 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 52,091 (increase of 54.1 percent), cities within 50 miles include Philadelphia (43 miles).8 Braidwood, near Braceville, Ill., two reactors, licensed 1987/1988, 2010 population within 50 miles is 4,976,020 (increase of 5.3 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 33,910 (increase of 6.5 percent), cities within 50 miles include Joliet (20 miles).9 Fermi, near Monroe, Mich., one reactor, licensed 1985, 2010 population within 50 miles is 4,799,526 (decrease of 3.4 percent in a decade), 2010 population within 10 miles is 92,377 (increase of 9.5 percent), cities within 50 miles include Detroit (30 miles) and Toledo, Ohio, (27 miles).

The analysis focused on 10 miles, the standard area in the U.S. for preparing for nuclear emergencies, and 50 miles, because of the recommendation given to Americans in Japan after the Fukushima emergency.The estimates for total population living with certain distances from any nuclear power plant:",http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42555888/ns/us_news-life/t/nuclear-neighbors-population-rises-near-us-reactors/,

A handy new interactive map from Esri calculates your exact distance from the nearest plants.How bad is it to have a nuclear plant as a neighbor? The chances of a meltdown may not be quite as small as was once believed: After the 2011 disaster in Fukushima prompted some reevaluating, at least one study found that serious accidents at reactors may be 200 times more likely than past estimates led people to believe. Based on the current number of reactors in the world, a major disaster like Fukushima might happen once every 10 or 20 years.The same year as Fukushima, five nuclear power plants in the U.S. lost primary power thanks to earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and flooding. On this map, extra layers show where fault lines run and where earthquakes have happened in the past to give some sense of the risk. But natural disasters aren’t the only challenge.There’s also the issue of age. Some nuclear power plants have been approved to keep running for 60 years even when they were only built for 40. Other plants have permission to run at higher power levels than what was specified in the original design. And then there’s the challenge of human error. Emergency shutdowns happen pretty regularly; over the last decade, a power plant in southern Washington State has shut down 23 times.If something happens to go wrong at a nuclear reactor, anyone living in a 10-mile radius of the plant may have to evacuate. This map also shows a 50-mile evacuation zone, the safe distance that the U.S. government recommended to Americans who were near Fukushima. Wind can also change how far a radioactive plume travels–in a similar map, the environmental group NRDC calculated where wind would have carried radiation if an accident had happened in the U.S. the same day it did in Japan.Even if nothing catastrophic happens, there’s also the chance that nuclear plants can have smaller leaks–the majority of reactors have leaked tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that can contaminate drinking water and, at high enough concentrations, cause cancer and genetic defects.",https://www.fastcompany.com/3028063/how-far-do-you-live-from-a-nuclear-power-plant,

Andrew Cuomo announced that he wants to see the Indian Point nuclear power plant, located 38 miles from New York City, shut down. “This plant in this proximity to the city was never a good risk,” he explained. Cuomo was hardly the first person to express concerns about the plant, which supplies power to New York City and its suburbs. A day before the governor’s statement, the nearly four-decade-old site was one of 14 US nuclear plants cited for safety “near-misses” in a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Which raises the question: What should New Yorkers do if a Japan-like emergency were to hit Indian Point?Recently that question got a lot more complicated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) currently sets the evacuation zone around American nuclear power plants, also known as the “Plume Exposure Pathway Emergency Planning Zone,” at 10 miles. Japanese authorities have evacuated residents living within about 19 miles of the damaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. But US officials have urged all Americans within 50 miles of the troubled Japanese reactors to get out of the way. Does this contradictory advice mean that our 10-mile emergency plans need to be revisited?NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko, in an appearance on CSPAN on Sunday, defended the 10-mile zones, noting that sites in the US don’t have as many reactors as the Japanese plant and that the plans are meant only for the immediate response. “What we want to do is build a system that we know at 10 miles we can activate that system quickly and we can mobilize it quickly,” said Jaczko. “We always appreciate that there may be circumstances where we have to expand that if necessary.”But the US government’s advice to keep 50 miles away from Fukushima has “opened up a Pandora’s box,” says Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who focuses on nuclear power and security. The group has previously argued that the zones need to be reevaluated. “This is certainly going to raise questions about the safety of those who live more than 10 miles from the plants in the US.”Widening the evacuation zones to 50 miles around the United States’ 104 plants would affect a number of densely populated areas. The Indian Point zone would, of course, then include all of New York City—meaning that the 21 million people in the 50-mile radius might need to relocate in case of a serious emergency. Maryland’s Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is nearly 50 miles from Washington, DC, home to 500,000. The McGuire Nuclear Station is just 17 miles from Charlotte, North Carolina, which has 730,000 residents. (See our chart below to see how many cities and towns are located within the 50-mile zone, or check out CNN’s map that lets you see how close you live to a nuclear power plant.)I grew up a little less than 20 miles from the New Jersey’s Salem Nuclear Power Plant and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station, which have three reactor units between them. (The Hope Creek generator is a GE Mark 1 boiling water reactor, the same model as those that are currently in distress in Japan.) The plant is also about 50 miles from Philadelphia, with a population of 1.4 million. Philadelphia also has the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant just 21 miles northwest of the city.I lived outside the 10-mile evacuation zone for the New Jersey power plant, but my friends on the other side of the line had siren systems in their neighborhoods, did regular evacuation drills, and received updated information every year explaining the emergency evacuation plans. There were also plans in place to distribute potassium iodide to those in the zone in the event of an emergency. The Baptist Bible summer camp I attended was inside the zone, which meant that every year all of us campers had to practice an evacuation drill. The emergency siren would go off and we would all line up at the flagpole. Then we’d board a big yellow school bus and drive away, ostensibly to safety somewhere outside the evacuation zone. Even as a child, I was a little confused about the whole thing: If something really bad happened, where would we go, and how would we even know that a bus would actually come pick us up, anyway? Moreover, what were the people right on the other side of that 10-mile radius supposed to do?Setting 50 miles as the new standard evacuation zone “would be an enormous challenge,” says the UCS’s Lyman. Not only would officials have to devise a plan to move hundreds of thousands of additional people, they’d also have to educate many more residents and local emergency responders who probably aren’t even aware that they live relatively close to a nuclear power plant. It would also complicate things for the nuclear industry. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s lobbying group here in the US, pushed back on noting that the 50-mile zone was necessary in Japan, stating last week that it had “questions about the scientific basis” for issuing that advisory. A look at the locations of nuclear power plants across the country makes it clear that changing the zone would present significant logistical questions, to say the least:Click on the table’s headers to sort the data.Chart made using data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

There’s an additional 100 million gallons that has been generated from the production of nuclear weapons, according to Oliver—so much of it, that one out of three Americans live within 50 miles of nuclear waste.Oliver says that despite years of using nuclear energy, the country still doesn’t have a permanent facility for its storage. If the U.S. wants to avoid a Fukushima-like accident, Oliver notes that the U.S. needs one badly. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada was supposed to be that site, but the project has stalled. Current sites, Oliver argues, are unsafe, particularly one nuclear storage facility in California that sits on a fault line next to the ocean, which Oliver says sounds like something from the opening scene of “a movie starring the Rock that you watch on a plane.”Perhaps most alarming is that, way back in the 1970s, a news team produced a report nearly identical to the one shown on Last Week Tonight, and America’s nuclear waste problem was supposed to be taken care of back then. “It was a problem we should have solved in the 1980s,” says Oliver, “much like a Rubik’s Cube.”",http://time.com/4908330/john-oliver-nuclear-waste-last-week-tonight/,

What are the dangers? How close is too close? Can you somehow make your home nuke-proof? Will you need special insurance? And what might a plant accident do to your home's value?These are top-of-mind questions for many homeowners who either live in a nuclear neighborhood or are thinking of buying or building near one of America's 104 nuclear reactors.The March 11 explosions and radiation leaks at Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear facility, like the 1986 Chernobyl and 1979 Three Mile Island accidents before them, introduced a whole new generation of homeowners to the complexities of living with nuclear neighbors.We put these questions and more to a trio of experts: William Miller, professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Missouri's Nuclear Science and Engineering Institute; Tristan Roberts, editorial director of BuildingGreen.com; and Alexandra Sascha von Meier, professor of environmental studies and planning at Sonoma State University.Judging by their strong responses, this hot topic isn't likely to cool down anytime soon.Financial Upside: Better Standard of LivingLet's start with the obvious question: Is it safe to live near a nuclear plant?Absolutely; study after study has shown this, says Miller. The bizarre fact is, cancer rates and risks in general are lower around plants. That has nothing to do with the plant itself, but instead with the higher standard of living of the people who live and work there. They have good-paying jobs, they take care of themselves, they have the money to pay for medical care.Von Meier begs to differ. (Nuclear power) is obviously very dangerous, very susceptible to mistakes, and I don't believe it's necessary because I am more optimistic that renewable resources can supply a very, very high percentage of our needs.But von Meier admits her concerns have as much to do with who's operating the plant as it does with nuclear power itself.I wouldn't buy a house next to a random reactor because I don't know the training and the culture of the people who operate it, which is not generally accessible, she says. I think this issue of transparency has been a major problem.A nuclear accident nearby poses two main health threats: direct radiation from the damaged reactor and ingestion, typically by breathing, of a radioactive isotope such as iodine-131 or cesium-137 that has become airborne from an explosion.Ingestion is the greater health threat because of its potential to concentrate radiation within the body. Iodine-131 typically leads to cancer of the thyroid, especially in children. Cesium-137 can contribute to a wide variety of cancers.Direct radiation, by contrast, dissipates rapidly the farther away you are from the source. Distance is obviously a very large player here, as is the direction of the wind, says Miller.So how close is too close?A 10-mile or so radius is more than sufficient, Miller says. There is always the statistical chance of cancer in the future, but in the Japanese situation, with the doses we've seen, even the workers at the plant might have a one-half (percent) to 1% increased cancer risk over their lifetimes. A mile away, that radiation level is way, way down by comparison.Here's the 411 on disaster-proofing your home:Despite a plethora of products that purport to block radiation, including metallic paints and lead-lined drywall, direct radiation will blow right through them just as it does through the pressurized metal cabins of commercial aircraft.You can, however, inexpensively block 95% of the more dangerous airborne particles by using plastic sheeting and duct tape to create airtight barriers over all door, window and chimney openings, according to ABC's Richard Besser.What you really need is a strategy to make your home passively survivable for an extended stay inside your makeshift oversized Glad bag.Do You Have to Get Nuclear Insurance?You won't find nuclear coverage in your standard homeowners insurance policy. In fact, it specifically excludes nuclear hazard liability to avoid sharing this largely uncharted risk.But the main reason you can't purchase nuclear insurance is Americans already have it, thanks to a nuclear industry contingency fund mandated by Congress in 1957.In the same year that President Dwight Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program launched the nation's first nuclear plant at Shippingport, Pa., Congress enacted the Price-Anderson Act. It requires all nuclear plant operators to maintain an insurance fund, currently at about $12.9 billion, to pay liability claims for personal injury, sickness, disease and death, property damage and loss, and living expenses for displaced victims resulting from a commercial nuclear plant accident.To date, that fund has paid out $71 million in claims resulting from the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.The nuclear program really completely hinges on many billions of dollars of federal money being spent to shore it up, says von Meier. It is not viable in the private sector alone, starting with liability insurance; you can't get it, we have to underwrite it as a society.The Atomic Energy Commission once envisioned that America would have 1,000 nuclear reactors online by 2000. Public protests and safety concerns following Three Mile Island trimmed those hopes dramatically. Today, America boasts 104 reactors at 64 commercial nuclear facilities, some near major cities such as Boston, Los Angeles and New York City.Do good nukes make good neighbors? It seems so, judging by the 2010 U.S. Census, which found that the number of residents living within 10 miles of a nuclear plant increased by 17% over the last decade.

(AP) — As America's nuclear power plants have aged, the once-rural areas around them have become far more crowded and much more difficult to evacuate. Yet government and industry have paid little heed, even as plants are running at higher power and posing more danger in the event of an accident, an Associated Press investigation has found.Populations around the facilities have swelled as much as 4½ times since 1980, a computer-assisted population analysis shows. But some estimates of evacuation times have not been updated in decades, even as the population has increased more than ever imagined. Emergency plans would direct residents to flee on antiquated, two-lane roads that clog hopelessly at rush hour. And evacuation zones have remained frozen at a 10-mile radius from each plant since they were set in 1978 — despite all that has happened since, including the accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima Dai-ichi in Japan. Meanwhile, the dangers have increased. More than 90 of the nation's 104 operating reactors have been allowed to run at higher power levels for many years, raising the radiation risk in a major accident. In an ongoing investigative series, the AP has reported that aging plants, their lives extended by industry and regulators, are prone to breakdowns that could lead to accidents. And because the federal government has failed to find a location for permanent storage of spent fuel, thousands of tons of highly radioactive used reactor rods are kept in pools onsite — and more is stored there all the time. These mounting risks, though, have not resulted in more vigilant preparations for possible accidents. The AP found serious weaknesses in plans for evacuations around the plants, including emergency drills that do not move people and fail to test different scenarios involving the weather or the time of day. Some plans are merely on checklists, and never have been tested. In drills, responders typically go to command centers and not to their emergency posts. There is no federal requirement for how fast an evacuation must be carried out. And disaster planners from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have made dubious assumptions about the public response to a major accident. They insist, for example, that people who are not called upon to evacuate will stay put; they're now saying that they might under some circumstances tell people to hunker down at home even in the 10-mile evacuation zone, and they believe people will do it. That advice flies in the face of decades of science and policy, millions of dollars in planning and preparations — and common sense. The advice also conflicts with what U.S. officials told Americans in Japan in March, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out power to Fukushima and melted fuel in three of its six nuclear reactors. Japanese officials ordered those living within 12 miles of the site to leave. The U.S. government's advice to its citizens? If you're within 50 miles, you should evacuate. And NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko insisted that this was nothing more than what would be recommended in a similar situation at home. In fact, under rules in force for more than 30 years, U.S. communities must by law prepare federally reviewed evacuation plans only for those living within 10 miles of a plant. In a severe accident, most of the early deaths — those from radiation sickness, not cancer — are predicted to occur within a 10-mile radius. Those living within 50 miles, meanwhile, are covered only by an emergency ingestion zone, where states are required to make plans to ban contaminated food and water — but not evacuate. After a May 10 tour at the Indian Point nuclear complex, where two reactors operate just 25 miles from New York City's northern border, Jaczko said the 10-mile rule was merely a planning standard. He said decisions on what to do in the unlikely event of an accident would be based on circumstances. So if we needed to take action beyond 10 miles, that's certainly what would be recommended. If a 50-mile order were ever issued for Indian Point, it would take in about 17.3 million people — 6 percent of all Americans, according to an AP population analysis. That would include parts of New Jersey and Connecticut and all of New York City, except for a chunk of Staten Island. Such a mass exodus would be an enormous challenge — and a historic feat, said Kelly McKinney, New York City's deputy commissioner of preparedness. At no time in the history of man, he said, has anyone tried to move 17 million people in 48 hours. ___ ANALYSIS PINPOINTS GROWTH When reactors were being built, starting in the 1960s, they were generally kept away from population centers. Their remote locations were viewed as a fundamental safety feature — protection aimed at reducing potential doses and property damage in the event of a severe accident, according to federal guidelines. However, over the decades, millions of newcomers have transformed tranquil woodland or shoreline into buzzing suburbs and bedroom communities. The AP gathered four sets of population data starting in 1980 through 2010 and used mapping software to calculate growth as part of a yearlong investigation of aging issues at nuclear power plants. Last week, the AP reported that federal regulators, working in concert with industry, have repeatedly weakened or failed to enforce safety standards so old reactors can keep operating. The records review included tens of thousands of pages of government and industry studies, test results, inspection reports and regulatory policy statements. The AP found in its population analysis that over the decades, plant operators and federal regulators have given surprisingly little thought to nearby population growth. Officials calculate plant safety margins without considering whether an accident would expose 10,000 or 100,000 people to radiation sickness and cancer. And federal regulators have set no limit for how long evacuations may take for given conditions and locations. The NRC and FEMA acknowledge that radiation releases can happen within a half hour of an accident. Yet a 2004 study for Indian Point estimated total evacuation time from the 10-mile zone, in the snow that is common during local winters, would take 12 hours. The federal government has not even required population updates for the evacuation zones, though that would change under a proposal expected to be adopted later this year. The AP analysis also shows that: —Four million people now live within 10 miles of the 65 operating sites. (Population in overlapping zones was counted only once for this part of the analysis.) Back in 1980, with 38 nuclear sites, only 1.5 million people lived that close. —Overall, from 1980 to 2010, the average population in the 10-mile evacuation zones ballooned by 62 percent, from 39,762 to 64,363. —Populations within the 10-mile radius have more than doubled at 12 of the 65 sites during the same 30-year period. —The most explosive growth occurred around the two-reactor Saint Lucie complex near Fort Pierce, Fla., where the 10-mile population of 43,332 in 1980 grew 366 percent to 202,010 in 2010. Others in the top five: the two-unit Brunswick complex near the North Carolina coast, which increased 326 percent from 8,164 to 34,782; Monticello, 35 miles from Minneapolis, where population rose 314 percent from 14,130 to 58,538; the two-unit Turkey Point site, 20 miles south of Miami, up 302 percent; and the two-unit San Onofre facility in San Clemente, Calif., up 283 percent. —Among newer reactors, the biggest jump occurred around Shearon Harris, 20 miles southwest of Raleigh, N.C., where population nearly quadrupled from 24,700 in 1990 to 94,465 in 2010. Three other facilities where populations more than doubled during the same 20-year period are the three-unit Palo Verde site, 50 miles west of Phoenix; two-unit McGuire site, 17 miles north of Charlotte, N.C., and the two-unit Catawba complex in South Carolina, 18 miles south of Charlotte. —About 120 million people, almost 40 percent of all Americans, live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant, according to the AP's analysis of 2010 Census data. ___ TRAFFIC JAMS ON A GOOD DAY The geography and population around Indian Point have always been a challenge for emergency planners. Homes and businesses dot hillsides sloping to the eastern shore of the Hudson River. Along its bank, a curvy, two-lane main artery meanders past traffic lights through quaint town centers suffused with Dutch history and the lore of writer Washington Irving. At rush hour, the roadway crawls with idling cars. Choke points are everywhere: the narrow Bear Mountain Bridge just north of the plant; the Route 202 slog through old Peekskill; and the Tappan Zee Bridge, which acts as the major river crossing to the south, beyond the 10-mile evacuation zone. A potential destination for many evacuees, the bridge often backs up with traffic for miles during the morning and evening commutes. Just a mile to the west across the Hudson, two-lane Route 9W snakes beneath the base of Bear Mountain State Park, offering few escape routes. Though modest population growth of 32 percent within 10 miles of Indian Point has mirrored the nation's increase as a whole between 1980 and 2010, more people live within this evacuation zone than any other in the country: 268,906, according to the AP analysis. Population density isn't the only concern. A 2008 Columbia University study discovered a seismic fault line near Indian Point, where another earthquake-prone zone was already known to exist. Yet a steel liner designed to be earthquake-proof has been leaking at the site since 1973. New York state has fought relicensing. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the area can't be evacuated in a severe nuclear accident. Given the local topography — natural and man-made — a quick evacuation would be a challenge. But when Jaczko's talk of a possible 50-mile evacuation in the United States is brought into the equation, the prospect is truly daunting. In some accidents, New Yorkers would presumably head west to New Jersey using the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel — passageways that are rarely light on traffic. Any evacuation from the 10-mile zone along those routes could be complicated by a so-called shadow evacuation by those living within 50 miles who defy official instructions to stay put. There are other fears — that some police and bus drivers would leave instead of stay to help and that parents would rush to schools instead of meeting their children at designated centers outside the evacuation zone. As with other nuclear sites, the Indian Point emergency plan puts school reception centers outside the 10-mile zone — but not far outside. Indian Point's lead community evacuation planner, Anthony Sutton, at the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services, acknowledged that area roads couldn't handle the traffic surge from a full-scale nuclear emergency. I think in a perfect world, we'd all like to see the place in a different location, with all the challenges of evacuating the public around it, he said. Paul Blanch, a nuclear safety expert who used to consult at Indian Point but now opposes its effort for a 20-year license extension, was more blunt: No matter what they say, they're not going to be able to evacuate these areas. John Curry, Indian Point's emergency director, said he believes people can evacuate from the 10-mile zone. But he acknowledges the depth of public skepticism: It's very difficult, and I don't know how to make them feel any better. ___ SAFETY IN 'LOW' NUMBERS Two dozen of the nuclear sites along the East Coast are within 50 miles of New York, Boston, Washington, Baltimore or Richmond, Va. Anyone who lives on the East Coast knows population has grown up around these reactors, and there are certain places where they should never have been built in the first place, said Jim Riccio, nuclear policy analyst for environmental group Greenpeace. For the most part, though, the early sites were favored if they satisfied the criterion of remoteness from heavily populated areas, according to the NRC's predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1998, federal guidelines said low-population areas were generally preferred because they limit exposure to radiation accidents. This was viewed as part of the NRC's philosophy of multiple layers of accident safeguards. NRC regulations continue to require low population zones around prospective nuclear sites. But from the beginning, it was hard to use very remote sites. Sites were desirable when they were still close enough to transportation networks to haul in massive equipment and supplies and near enough to amenities to lure engineers and corporate managers. The contradiction meant choosing places like the piney hills of Wake County, N.C., where federal regulators gave permission to build Shearon Harris in 1978. They described the region as a sparely populated rural area. But it was just 20 miles from Raleigh — and future commuter sprawl — which accounted for the population nearly quadrupling within the 10-mile zone from 1990 (three years after it went online) to 2010. Complicating things nationwide, government and industry officials also tended to underestimate projected growth — picking numbers that helped win approval for favored sites. For example, federal regulators predicted in 1973 that the 50-mile population around the Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida would expand from 155,900 to only 381,000 by 2020. The basic rural character of the area is not expected to change in the coming 40 years, the government predicted. Yet the plant was built in Citrus County on the state's picture-postcard west coast, 70 miles north of Tampa. And by 2010 — 10 years ahead of the predicted timetable — the population had already multiplied by six, to over 1 million, the AP analysis shows. These population explosions are very likely to make the evacuation plan unworkable, said anti-nuclear activist Paul Gunter at Beyond Nuclear in Takoma Park, Md., who has pressed for reviews of emergency community planning before relicensing. Even Dana Powers, a member of the NRC's independent Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, says his group has had troubles with evacuation strategy assumptions. U.S. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu recently suggested that the Japanese accident will indeed drive U.S. regulators to pick less populated areas for future nuclear plants. Emergency readiness was supposed to account for growth and stay up to date. The joint guidance of the NRC and FEMA in 1980 stated that evacuation time estimates should be updated as local conditions change. In fact, according to AP's review of government records, once plant turbines started humming, little was done to keep planning in step with population increases. In 2007, then-Commissioner Jaczko acknowledged that some evacuation time estimates had not been updated in decades. A proposed rule would require fresh estimated evacuation times with new Census data every 10 years — and after that, with any jumps in population that would increase the time estimate by either 25 percent or 30 minutes. The proposal also would require an annual update of the population estimate. If adopted as expected, it would be the first overhaul of emergency preparedness rules since 1980. Given the lack of a required evacuation time, though, any updates might make little difference. Even with increased concern among federal regulators, challenges remain in the mission to inform the public quickly and accurately. A FEMA web page entitled Nuclear Power Plant Emergency, last modified on April 8, states: Nearly 3 million Americans live within 10 miles of an operating nuclear power plant. That's off by one million people. Then there is the relatively new and sparsely publicized concession to escalating populations and roads that haven't been upgraded or widened in decades. It's called sheltering — if people stay put, maybe they can evacuate later, after the first wave of people has left. A 2007 Sandia National Laboratories report said excess radiation doses could be reduced if residents simply hunkered down in their homes. However, the report acknowledged that some contamination and radiation will enter most shelters. Then, sending another mixed message that could prompt unofficial evacuations, the report continued: If quick evacuation is possible, leaving is always the most appropriate recommendation. ___ PLAYING WITH NUMBERS As part of its investigation, the AP has reported that researchers' numbers and assumptions — along with NRC regulations — have been periodically adjusted to keep the reactors within stated limits for operating safety. Similarly, confronted with evacuation troubles, the NRC has minimized the presumed impact of accidents, allowing plants to stay on the power grid. The studies date back to the early 1980s, when the NRC wanted more guidance about where to locate nuclear reactors. So the agency decided to assess the potential effects of serious accidents on surrounding communities. Its 1982 report alarmed Congress. At Indian Point Unit 3, the study predicted 64,000 deaths and $314 billion in damages from a bad accident ($700 billion today, adjusted for inflation). The public was so shaken that the NRC and industry avoided similar analyses for decades. However, in its Indian Point relicensing proposal, owner Entergy Corp. finally reevaluates some of the numbers. The effects of a bad accident are minimized, according to an AP analysis of those numbers: no more than 2,130 cancer deaths and only $117 billion in economic damages. Plant spokesman Jerry Nappi went even further when pressed. Contrary to the calculations of planners, he said he didn't believe a scenario like this is credible or perhaps even possible with all the protections built into the plant. As for a 50-mile evacuation encompassing New York, he said a 10-mile radius is already a very conservative planning zone. Nuclear planners gave similar confident reassurances about their tsunami planning in Japan. And the BP emergency plans left out Gulf of Mexico oil spill scenarios that occurred, even though they supposedly couldn't happen. Meanwhile, the NRC's partner, Sandia National Laboratories, has again been studying the impact of accidents. The work is still under way, but researchers have tentatively concluded that reactor defenses will work way better than believed in the 1980s. NRC officials say the conclusion stems from decades of additional research and sophisticated computer modeling. But they also wrap their equations in a ribbon of rosy assumptions: —Accidents will develop more slowly than thought. —Buildings designed to contain radiation leaks will hold. —Emergency plans will work. —Responders will do their jobs. —Ninety percent of those told to stay put will obey. The magnitude of possible releases from these accidents is much smaller than originally thought, said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell in a preview of the conclusions expected to take final form by 2012. ___ PLANS LACK TEETH The population boom near nuclear sites cries out for stronger evacuation standards, according to safety watchdogs. But little has been done, thus helping ensure the continued operation of the aging reactors. While keeping evacuation zones the same size at aging plants, regulators often have allowed the units to run at higher power levels. More power means more radioactivity that could be released in an accident. Since 1977, all the reactors collectively have upgraded their maximum power output 139 times. In May, the two Point Beach reactors, on the Wisconsin shore of Lake Michigan, were each given permission to increase power levels by 17 percent. Meanwhile, population within 50 miles has grown by 36 percent from 573,050 to 779,140 over the past three decades. In 2008, the NRC's policymaking commissioners even voted to give lower-level staff the authority to approve sensitive changes that would weaken emergency plans. It had been in the purview of the commission itself. Today, government regulators verify emergency preparedness of communities essentially by checklists, not by standards for what plans must accomplish. They require that communities show the elements of a good plan, but not that the plan is effective. For example, evacuation time estimates are required, but there is no standard for how quickly people must be able to leave. Regulators say the estimates will help planners make decisions in a real accident, even in the absence of a standard. Jim Kish, a FEMA administrator who focuses on emergency preparedness, said in an interview that a standard would put communities in an undesirable planning box. They need the flexibility to make decisions on what to evacuate, and when to evacuate, and how to evacuate, he said. I think the NRC wants to make sure that the evacuation side of things doesn't make plants have to close, even if the population grows quickly, said Richard Webster, an environmental lawyer who unsuccessfully fought the relicensing petition at the Oyster Creek reactor in Lacey Township, N.J. More broadly, the government seems careful to avoid anything fully binding in its planning requirements. It sets a supposed standard that people within 10 miles must be notified of an accident within 45 minutes. But NRC rules also say that's not a guarantee early notification can be provided for everyone. And notification of an accident within 45 minutes says nothing about how long it will take to flee. NRC rules also concede there's no guarantee that emergency sirens, when tested under actual field conditions, will meet the design objective in all cases. This movable standard makes things easier for plant owners who often struggle to keep warning sirens working from their perches within the 10-mile zones. FEMA encourages drills for rush-hour traffic, night conditions, or bad weather. But it does not require them, the agency acknowledged. Heather Heigl, the lead community emergency planner for the area around the Brunswick site in North Carolina, said daylong drills every two years verify that the right people and resources are available, and that communications systems are working. However, she acknowledged, the exercises don't actually send rescue workers to shelters or police officers to traffic control points. Asked for the estimated evacuation times for her site, she wasn't sure. The NRC rubber-stamps these evacuation plans, but they're not based on discernible performance standards, said Alex Matthiessen, president of the Riverkeeper environmental group fighting Indian Point relicensing. If they applied any kind of meaningful standard in evaluating the emergency plans of the nation's nuclear power plants, there would be no nuclear power plants in this country, at least not in populated areas. Attorney Webster argued that safety standards should become harder to meet as populations grow around plants like Oyster Creek. (In AP's analysis, population between 1980 and last year increased 269 percent within 10 miles of Oyster Creek, from 36,738 to 135,378.) During an emergency there, many would be forced to leave in the same direction, away from the Atlantic Ocean, along a highway that a pro-nuclear state senator has called a two-lane cow path. Janet Tauro, a nuclear safety activist who lives 18 miles from the plant, wonders: Picture me with my son on his BMX bike and my daughter at dance class, multiply me by 100,000 — and you have pandemonium. Helen Henderson, who lives three miles from the reactor, is among the doubters. She said she repeatedly ignored the forms sent home by her children's school certifying that she has read and agrees with the Oyster Creek emergency plan. Tired of the stream of reminders sent her way, Henderson said she finally wrote back: Refuse to sign. Evacuation plan will not work. ___ The AP National Investigative Team can be reached at investigate(at)ap.org",https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2012/part-iii-ap-impact-populations-around-us-nuke-plants-soar,
Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-lawrence-odonnell-most-americans-live-withi/,True,---,Unrelated,Can not judge,Unrelated,Can not judge,,U.S. urges Americans within 50 miles of Japanese nuclear plant to evacuate; NRC chief outlines dangerous situation,"The United States on Wednesday urged Americans who live within 50 miles of Japan’s earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to evacuate, and the top U.S. nuclear regulatory official indicated that Japan faces an increasingly dangerous situation at one of the plant’s reactors.Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said Wednesday that no water remains in a deep pool used to cool spent fuel at the plant and that radiation levels there are thought to be “extremely high.”Japanese officials denied that the water is gone from the spent-fuel pool, the Associated Press reported.Jaczko, testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on what his agency has been told about the crisis, said the plant’s unit 4 reactor appeared to have suffered a hydrogen explosion.The reactor at unit 4 was shut down at the time of the earthquake last Friday, meaning that crews had transferred all of the radioactive fuel from the reactor’s core to the pool. The building housing the pool was damaged when two nearby reactor buildings exploded Saturday and Monday.“It’s unprecedented,” said David Helwig, a retired nuclear engineer who spent 40 years working on boiling water nuclear reactors of the same design as those at Fukushima Daiichi. “That’s never happened before.”Left exposed to the air, the fuel rods will start to decay and release radioactivity into the air.Severe structural damage is the only way the fuel pool could be emptied, Helwig said. The 50-foot-deep pools have no outlets at the bottom, thus preventing them from draining in case of an accident.The spent-fuel pool at another reactor, unit 3, also appeared compromised, Jaczko said.The increasingly desperate picture of the struggle at the stricken nuclear plant emerged after Japanese helicopter crews abandoned an attempt to dump water on the pools of uranium fuel after detecting dangerous radiation above the plant.Also Wednesday, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed damage to three of the facility’s six nuclear reactors, which contain radioactive fuel that is hotter, and more radioactive, than the fuel stored in the damaged pools.In another sign of the worsening crisis, the U.S. ambassador to Japan warned Americans to stay at least 50 miles from the plant — more than four times the distance recommended in the Japanese government’s evacuation plan. Japanese authorities confirmed that crews at the plant had to temporarily abandon their posts as radiation readings spiked.Jaczko’s testimony suggested that damage to the plant is worse than the Japanese government and the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., has acknowledged. On Tuesday, the company said water levels in the three of the site’s seven fuel pools were dropping, but did not say that the fuel rods themselves had been exposed.Such exposure has been a huge concern among some longtime critics of the standard practice at nuclear facilities of storing used, or “spent,” fuel in structures that lack the heavy concrete-and-steel shields surrounding the reactor cores themselves.A report on the Japanese crisis this week by Barclays Capital said, “Never, never, never allow the water level in a nuclear reactor to fall below the level of the fuel. This is the mantra pounded into the minds of nuclear power plant operators all over the world.” The report added, “It is hard to overemphasize the importance of the ‘keep the fuel covered’ training and design of these plants.” One of the report’s authors formerly provided such training at a U.S. commercial nuclear plant.The only solution sounds simple but has apparently proved impossible for the Japanese crews: spray water by any means possible. “Just get a firehose up there if you can,” said Arnie Gundersen, a nuclear engineer.The lack of water in at least one spent-fuel pool sparked fears of a worst-case scenario: the fuel could combust.“If there’s no water in there, the spent fuel can star a fire,” said Eric Moore, a consultant to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on nuclear plant design and safety issues. “Once you have that fire, there’s a high risk of radiation getting out, spewed by the fire.”In Japan, authorities scrambled Wednesday to find ways to cool the overheated elements at the nuclear plant and prevent them from emitting potentially lethal radiation.As radiation levels in the air above the plant spiked dangerously for the second consecutive day, U.S. Ambassador John V. Roos issued a recommendation based on a review of “the deteriorating situation” at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by experts from the NRC and Energy Department.“Consistent with the NRC guidelines that apply to such a situation in the United States, we are recommending, as a precaution, that American citizens who live within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant evacuate the area or to take shelter indoors if safe evacuation is not practical,” Roos said in a statement.Japan has asked people living within 12 miles of the plant to evacuate and urged those living between 12 and 18 miles away to stay indoors. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, about 150 miles north of Tokyo, is one of Japan’s largest nuclear facilities and is normally capable of producing more than 4,500 megawatts of electricity.The conflicting evacuation recommendations prompted a barrage of questions at Wednesday’s White House and State Department news briefings about the adequacy of the information Japan is providing to its citizens.U.S. officials maintained that the 50-mile recommendation simply reflects the advice the NRC would give if such an incident occurred in the United States. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the recommendation is “based on new information and a deteriorating and fast-moving situation” and does not reflect adversely on “the quality of information or the level of cooperation” in Japan.Earlier Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that U.S. forces participating in relief operations in Japan will not be allowed within 50 miles of the plant. Officials also said some flight crews are being issued potassium iodide tablets, which can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer from radiation exposure. The measure was described as precautionary. Several U.S. helicopter crews have been exposed to low levels of radiation, but no service members have shown signs of illness.At Fukushima, a small group of workers charged with cooling efforts was temporarily relocated. Within an hour, though, the radiation levels dropped again, and the crew was permitted to return.In order for them to resume trying to cool the damaged sectors, Japan’s health and welfare minister had to waive the nation’s standard of radiation exposure, increasing the level of acceptable exposure from 100 millisieverts to 250 — five times the level allowed in the United States.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, said in Vienna he plans to leave for Japan as soon as Thursday to get “firsthand information” on the situation at the stricken nuclear power plant. Amano, a former Japanese diplomat, said he wants to improve the flow of information to the IAEA about the crisis.Workers at the Fukushima plant were focusing on the unit 3 reactor building, where a white plume of smoke was spotted Wednesday morning, and on unit 4, where fires flared up Tuesday and again on Wednesday morning.The blazes triggered fears that spent uranium fuel sitting in a pool above the reactor was burning. Such a conflagration would generate intense concentrations of cesium-137 and other dangerous radioactive isotopes. But a spokesperson for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group, said Tokyo Electric Power Co. concluded that the first fire in unit 4 was not in the spent fuel pool, “but rather in a corner of the reactor building’s fourth floor.”Initially, government spokesman Yukio Edano said the steam coming from the unit 3 reactor building could mean that its containment vessel had ruptured in an earlier explosion — a potentially dire development. A reactor containment vessel in the plant’s unit 2 is believed to have ruptured on Tuesday.But Edano said Wednesday afternoon that the unit 3 containment vessel was unlikely to have suffered severe damage. The Japanese news agency Kyodo quoted the country’s nuclear disaster task force as saying: “The possibility of the No. 3 reactor having suffered severe damage to its containment vessel is low.”Still, Edano said officials presumed that the steam coming from unit 3 was indeed radioactive. He said emergency crews were still trying to determine its source .The rising steam was just the latest problem for the embattled plant, which suffered heavy damage to its cooling systems after Friday’s devastating earthquake and tsunami. Since then, the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric, which owns the facility, have struggled mightily to keep the plant’s six reactors cool. Each day has brought new problems.Tuesday’s blast at unit 2 was not outwardly visible, but was potentially more dangerous than some of the earlier explosions, because it may have created an escape route for radioactive material bottled up inside the thick steel-and-concrete reactor vessel.Radiation-laced steam is probably building between the reactor vessel and the building that houses it, experts said, creating pressure that could blow apart the structure, emitting radiation from the core.“They’re putting water into the core and generating steam, and that steam has to go somewhere. It has to be carrying radiation,” said nuclear engineer Arnie Gundersen, who has 40 years of experience overseeing the Vermont Yankee nuclear facility, whose re­actors are of the same vintage and design as those at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.Such a breach would be the first at a nuclear power plant since the Chernobyl catastrophe 25 years ago in what was then the Soviet Union.Nuclear experts have repeatedly stressed that radiation releases on the scale of Chernobyl are unlikely or even impossible, given the Japanese plant’s heavier engineering and additional layers of containment. Still, Tokyo Electric said radiation briefly rose to dangerous levels at the plant Tuesday morning and again on Wednesday.Crews noted a drop in pressure after the blast inside the unit 2 reactor and within a doughnut-shaped structure below, called a suppression pool. The simultaneous loss of pressure in those two places indicates serious damage, nuclear experts said.The explosion probably happened after the streams of seawater that crews have been pumping into the reactor faltered. The fuel rods were left completely exposed to the air for some time, Tokyo Electric said in a statement. Without water, the rods grew white-hot and possibly melted through the steel-and-concrete tube.The power company said a reduced crew of 50 to 70 employees — far fewer than the 1,400 or more at the plant during normal operations — had been working in shifts to keep seawater flowing to the three reactors now in trouble. Their withdrawal on Wednesday temporarily left the plant with nobody to continue cooling operations.Wednesday afternoon, the Japanese military dispatched two helicopters to the Daiichi plant from Kasuminome Air Base in Sendai. A lead chopper was sent to determine whether radiation levels were low enough to continue with the operation. The second helicopter, a Boeing CH-47, followed behind, a huge bucket of sea water dangling beneath it. The CH-47 was slated to make several passes to drop water onto unit 3. But the crew on the first copter found radiation levels were too high to carry out the risky mission.Using a helicopter, or fire hoses, to spray water through holes in the breached buildings would be a risky, last-ditch effort to prevent the spent fuel from burning. With the outer containment building at unit 2 primed for a possible explosion, experts said, any fire crews would be in grave peril.“This is scary,” said Lake Barrett, a nuclear engineer who directed the cleanup of the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania after the 1979 accident there. “The plans in a severe accident are to just get a fire hose in there, get any kind of water to keep water in the pool above the fuel. ”During normal plant operations, uranium fuel rods that can no longer produce enough heat for generating electricity are periodically removed from a reactor and placed into the spent-fuel pools above the reactors. These rods continue to generate heat and radioactive isotopes for many years.Keeping this material covered with water is sufficient to cool it. But water levels may have dropped dramatically during the crisis, exposing fuel rods to the air.Robert Alvarez, an analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies who has long warned of the dangers of spent fuel pools, said that — unlike the reactors themselves — the fuel pools typically do not have backup pumps to maintain water flow. “They were so overwhelmed,” he said of the workers straining to contain the disaster, that they were unable to maintain enough water in the pool to prevent boiling.If the fuel pools are exposed to the air, the radiation doses coming from them could be life-threatening up to 50 yards, Alvarez said.Concerns about the dangers of storing used uranium fuel in relatively poorly shielded pools above reactors increased with the fear of terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, causing industry experts to dispute the design. In 2006, the National Research Council issued a report saying in part that a uranium fuel fire “could result in the release of large amounts of radioactive material.”The NRC report also recommended that nuclear power plants build “redundant and diverse” coolant systems to keep the fuel underwater during a crisis.Late Tuesday, Tokyo Electric said water levels were “low” in unit 4’s used fuel pool. Japanese officials said Wednesday that the water level in unit 5 was slightly low but that they plan to use a generator to add more.Satellite photos show steam rising from the facility. The amount of radioactivity carried by the plume is unknown, but small increases in radiation — not enough to affect human health — were reported in Tokyo and in other parts of Japan.In response, NHK television reported that the Japanese government had ordered the country’s 47 prefectures to publicly report recorded radiation levels twice a day.Wednesday morning, 33 nuclear disaster experts from the U.S. Department of Energy arrived in Japan with 17,000 pounds of gear to help with the crisis.The teams will have plenty of work to do. The plant’s reactor cores take about two weeks to lose half of their intense heat, said Gundersen, the nuclear engineer, meaning that the battle between the radioactive cores and Fukushima Daiichi’s badly damaged cooling system will play out for days or weeks to come.In Tokyo, Roos, the U.S. ambassador, stressed that Japan would continued to play the lead role in responding to the disaster.“The Japanese government has significant expertise — and that’s probably an understatement saying ‘significant,’” Roos said. “They’re one of the most experienced countries in the world with regard to nuclear power and nuclear power plants.“The United States government also has significant and massive expertise in the nuclear area . . . the United States has and will continue to provide any support it can in continuing to address the issues as they have arisen.”Maese reported from Tokyo.

Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-lawrence-odonnell-most-americans-live-withi/,True,True,True,True,Can not judge,True,More than half the country lives within 50 Miles of a Nuclear Plant.,Population Change Near Nuclear Power Plants | Critigen,"On March 11, 2013 we passed the two year anniversary of the devastating Japan earthquake and subsequent meltdown of the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi. The lessons learned from this tragic event are long and sobering to anyone who cares to read about it. An article in my local newspaper caught my eye, though. The article covered a GAO report questioning the NRC’s understanding of how people who live beyond the 10 mile evacuation zone would react in the event that people within the 10 mile evacuation zone were told to evacuate. The phrase that caught my eye was “Shadow Evacuation”. Would people take flight (on the roads) on their own, clogging vital evacuation routes and potentially delaying or making a quick evacuation impossible?With five nuclear plants within 50 miles of my house, I noticed some large population change numbers being quoted in the articles. Not that I didn’t believe the numbers, but I decided that this was something I wanted to independently verify using ArcGIS. The question I set out to answer was:“How has population changed since 1990 within 10, 20, and 50 miles around our nation’s nuclear plants?”The answer is a lot more complicated than expected due to a number of factors. First, the changing nature of the Tiger/Line census boundary files makes decadal change analysis difficult. Second, data is available on the Census fact finder site but it’s not exactly “user” friendly to extract and helped me understand the value of the datasets published by Esri and others. Third, at what scale can I get the same data more or less in the same place. Fourth, people make a living doing this type of change analysis and now I know why. It has a lot of caveats and always will until the day Census data is published down to the household street address level (never).In my quest for a comparable census dataset I found the National Historical Geographic information System. I could rant all day about FactFinder, or just save my energy and go here instead. For this analysis I was able to grab population data and GIS boundaries at the tract level for 1990, 2000, and 2010 for the entire US. Thank you very much!All results are available in this web map published on ArcGIS Online.The results (xls here) confirm the population around US nuclear plants is growing in absolute terms but not much more than the overall change rate for the entire nation. While the total numbers shouldn’t be used as an exact reference, they are valid in a relative sense (to the census tract level) and likely within a few percentage points if this analysis were done at the census block level. More than half the country lives within 50 Miles of a Nuclear Plant (Table 1). More surprising to me was the big increases in the number of people living within 10 and 20 miles of these nuclear plants.Table 2 shows plants where the surrounding population increased by more than 50% (an arbitrary breakpoint). I was then able to take a closer look at the most dramatic population changes that are above the national 24% change since 1990. Surprising to me is that population growth rates exceeding 24% were seen at 28 of the 65 active nuclear plants, and it isn’t just the “Shadow” population that needs review.Looking at the Shearon Harris 10 Mile area (Figure 1) and the 149% growth in population from the 1990 baseline (Table 2), it begs the question of where in the immediate area did this population growth occur?To identify areas of growth I symbolized the 1990 census tract polygons in purple outline so we can see the tract boundary changes in comparison to 2010. For the most part, the greatest population changes occurred directly to the east and northeast of the Shearon Harris plant towards Raleigh. Notice all the new and smaller area census tracts? Also, notice the slivers of other census tracts that have been included as part of the 10 mile calculation? I would use the tract centroid if needing higher accuracy on the population numbers since the method I used adds several thousand people. Maybe next time.Taking a step back to the “Shadow Evacuation” topic, the population change from 1990-2010 within 20 Miles of Shearon Harris increased by 91% (Table 3) or approximately 250K more people, and almost 60% within 50 miles (Table 4) or approximately 1 million more people.Another example of “Shadow” population growth is at the Palo Verde nuclear plant (Figure3). The population grew 200% from 1990 to 2010 within 20 miles (Table 3). While not large in total numbers it still represents a doubling of the population. Looking out to 50 miles, there are more than 1 Million more people in the area (Table 4).Checking into one phrase in a newspaper article (“Shadow Evacuation”) led me to a much more interesting and complex analysis than I anticipated. But thanks to some great data provided by NHGIS and some awesome Esri ArcGIS tools (ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS Online) I was able to build and share this analysis. I imagine pairing this data up with changes in transportation infrastructure capacity, backed up with studies that analyze maximum traffic flow in these high growth areas. I hope our regulators are doing this kind of analysis and more, planning for the safe evacuation of our citizens in the unlikely event of our own Fukushima Daiichi.",http://www.critigen.com/blog/population-change-near-nuclear-power-plants,

Map the radiation path to your home.,"After you enter your zip code you will see a circle. This is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s proposed 20-mile radius (40 miles diameter) Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) – an area where states may elect to distribute just a few tablets of potassium iodide to residents in case of exposure to radioactive iodine. Truly, you’ll likely an entire pack of potassium iodide tablets, or more.The American Thyroid Association recommends potassium iodide be made available to EVERYONE else in the country, regardless of your distance from a nuclear reactor.Radioactive iodine released from the Chernobyl and Fukushima reactors and nuclear bomb testing traveled hundreds of miles from the source, causing over 200,000 cases of thyroid cancer.There are 36 non-power nuclear reactors currently operating in the U.S. These smaller nuclear reactors, which do not generate power, are in locations such as universities and other organizations where research, testing or training is conducted. Research nuclear reactors produce radioisotopes for nuclear medicine, are used to train people in the nuclear sciences and are used as a laboratory tool, as a producer of byproduct material or as a source of radiation for experiments. Here is a detailed list of U.S. research reactors.On April 26, 1986, the #4 nuclear reactor at the Russian Chernobyl Nuclear Station exploded during a routine test. The radioactive iodine released from the explosion rose into the air and spread across thousands of square miles in the Ukraine, Belarus and Poland. Potassium Iodide was distributed in the immediate areas surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Station, including the Pripyat region where most of the workers lived. Controlled by the weather conditions at the time, the radioactive plume touched down again and again in numerous populated areas as far out as 500 km (over 300 miles). Below are facts as extracted from official accounts and government publications.Chernobyl: What’s been learned, What’s been ignored97% of all thyroid cancer cases attributed to radioactive iodine from Chernobyl occurred in people who lived 31-310 miles from the accident site. (Due to the distribution of Potassium Iodide in the areas nearer the accident site including the Pripyat region)“Evidence of a marked excess of thyroid cancer in children exposed to the fallout from the Chernobyl accident has been established. In the most affected areas of Belarus, the yearly incidence has risen close to 100 per million children, which is more than 100-fold compared to the situation before the accident. It is now generally accepted that this excess has resulted from exposure to the radioactive iodine released in the accident”.“Most of the children that have developed thyroid cancer were exposed to an estimated dose to the thyroid of less than 300 mGy. There has been an excess thyroid cancer incidence even in areas where the mean dose to the thyroid in children was estimated at 50-100 mGy. The increase in incidence has been documented up to 500 km [310 miles] from the accident site. This is understandable in terms of the wide area affected by radioiodine and therefore the large number of children exposed”.“The Chernobyl accident has thus demonstrated that significant doses from radioactive iodine can occur hundreds of kilometers from the site, beyond emergency planning zones. A sharp distinction in the requirements for stable iodine prophylaxis based on distance from the accident site cannot be made”.“The number of people with thyroid cancer began to increase about five years after the accident. This number continues to rise. Today, over 11,000 cases of childhood thyroid cancer due to Chernobyl have been reported, with the number not expected to peak until 2010. The World Health Organization’s International Thyroid Project has found evidence that even relatively low levels of radiation exposure may result in underactive thyroid syndrome, also known as hypothyroidism”.– United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs- 2000“Except for thyroid cancer, there has been no confirmed increase in the rates of other cancers, including leukemia, among the first responders, cleanup workers and military personnel in the contaminated zones following the accident, or the public, that have attributed to releases from the accident”“The vast majority of the thyroid cancers were diagnosed among those living more than 50 km (31 miles) from the site”. – U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission NUREG-1633“Stable iodine could also be used as prophylaxis against ingested radioactive iodine from contaminated food. However, because the risk of exposure from ingestion of iodine remain for a longer time, iodine prophylaxis will also be required for a longer period of time“Remarks on the need for potassium iodide made by Commission Chairman Nils Diaz of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission …”use of potassium iodide pills would have significantly reduced the incidence of thyroid cancer [during Chernobyl]”.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has revised a section of its emergency preparedness regulations. The revised rule requires that States* with a population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone (EPZ) of commercial nuclear power plants consider including potassium iodide as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.The final rule amends 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10). The NRC published the rule change in the Federal Register (Volume 66, Number 13, page 5427) on January 19, 2001. The change became effective April 19, 2001.Along with this rule change, the NRC is providing funding for a supply of potassium iodide for a State that chooses to incorporate potassium iodide for the general public into their emergency plans. After funding the initial supply of potassium iodide, the Commission may consider extending this program to fund replenishment supplies, but has made no commitments in this regard.Potassium iodide is a salt, similar to table salt. Its chemical symbol is KI. It is routinely added to table salt to make it “iodized.” Potassium iodide, if taken within the appropriate time and at the appropriate dosage, blocks the thyroid gland’s uptake of radioactive iodine and thus reduces the risk of thyroid cancers and other diseases that might otherwise be caused by thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine that could be dispersed in a severe reactor accident.The NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are the two Federal agencies responsible for evaluating emergency preparedness at and around nuclear power plants. The NRC is responsible for assessing the adequacy of onsite emergency plans developed by the utility, while FEMA is responsible for assessing the adequacy of offsite emergency planning. The NRC relies on FEMA’s findings in determining that there is reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the definitive medical authority in the United States on the use of potassium iodide.*When used in this Web site, State includes Native American governments.This rule applies to States and Tribal governments with nuclear power plants within their borders, with populations within the 10-mile EPZ, and local governments designated by States to request potassium iodide funding.The Commission believes the final rule, together with the Commission’s decision to provide funding for the purchase of a State’s supply of potassium iodide, strikes a proper balance between encouraging (but not requiring) the offsite authorities to take advantage of the benefits of potassium iodide and acknowledging the offsite authorities’ role in such matters. By requiring consideration of the use of potassium iodide, the Commission recognizes the important role of States and local governments in matters of emergency planning.On December 20, 2001, the NRC sent letters to the 34 States with populations within the 10-mile EPZ of nuclear reactors. This letter discusses the NRC program to provide potassium iodide to States and includes, as attachments: the NRC Statement of Consideration in support of the final rule; the FDA final guidelines on use of potassium iodide; and FEMA guidelines on incorporating potassium iodide into emergency response plans, as well as the NRC disclaimer .The revised Federal Policy on Use of Potassium Iodide was also provided to the States.The Office of Public Affairs issued a press release on 12/20/01, to announce the NRC’s potassium iodide program.On January 12, 2005, the FDA approved the ThyroShield oral solution of 65mg/mL dose for use in children. On November 10, 2005, the NRC, in cooperation with the Department of Health and Human Services, sent letters to the States announcing the availability of 51 million doses of ThyroShield liquid pediatric KI for States with populations within the 10 mile EPOn October 26, 2006, the NRC sent letters to the 21 States that have received 130 and/or 65 mg potassium iodide tablets through the NRC’s initial KI offer. This letter discusses the NRC’s decision to replace expiring stockpiles of potassium iodide on a one-time basis as well as instructions for obtaining replacement KI stockpiles. The letter includes, as attachments, the FDA final guidelines on use of potassium iodide; the NRC Statement of Consideration in support of the final rule; the NRC disclaimer; and Staff Requirements – SECY-06-0142 – Options and Recommendations for Replenishing Expired Potassium Iodide (KI).NRC received numerous inquiries from States regarding the possibility of extending the shelf-life of the KI tablets in light of the approval by FDA to the manufacturers for product shelf-life extension. The manufacturer (RECIP) of the 65-mg tablet issued an extension of the product by lot number. The manufacturer (Anbex) of the 130 mg tablets in a correspondence from its legal counsel to the NRC indicated that there are no significant differences in the formulation, manufacturing process, or packaging materials for the existing lots as compared to current lots. The FDA in a letter to NRC stated that “It would be considered to be scientifically sound if the lots having the expiration date extended had no significant difference in formulation, manufacturing process or packaging materials from current lots. The letter …to NRC from counsel to Anbex, Inc. dated January 23, 2007 indicates that this is the case.” In a letter to the States, the NRC transmitted the FDA correspondence on shelf-life extension and Commission direction to Staff (SRM-COMSECY-07002 ) on full and partial replenishment of KI, and announced the availability of additional pediatric liquid KI.States that choose to extend their stockpiles must document the lot number(s) of the KI product, the current expiration date, and the extended expiration date. This document should be available for review by representatives from DHS/FEMA Radiological Preparedness Program during the routine evaluations of offsite emergency preparedness.The NRC final rule on the Consideration of Potassium Iodide in Emergency Plans was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001. This rule became effective April 19, 2001. The FDA final guidance on Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies was published in December 2001. The Federal Emergency Management Agency published the revised Federal Policy on the Use of Potassium Iodide in January 2002.Twenty states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Vermont, Delaware, Florida, Alabama, Arizona, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, California, Ohio, Virginia, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Hampshire, and Tennessee) have requested and/or received potassium iodide tablets.The Commission notes that this rule will introduce another element in the context of emergency planning requirements for which licensees are ultimately responsible. Licensees have the obligation to confirm that offsite authorities have considered the use of potassium iodide as a supplemental protective action for the general public. It will also require the licensees to use this information in developing Protective Action Recommendations for offsite agencies.Section 127 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act) requires State and local governments through the national KI stockpile to distribute KI tablets to population within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant. The Bioterrorism Act also directed the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the expanded distribution of potassium iodide and report back to the President on the best distribution methods to accomplish such an expanded distribution. The NAS published this study in January 2004.On August 29, 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published draft guidelines for State, local, and tribal governments, for the expanded distribution, stockpiling, and utilization of KI in the event of a radioactive iodine release from a commercial nuclear power plant incident. On September 2, 2005, HHS issued a correction to add deadline for receiving public comments. The NRC provided comments to the draft guidelines on November 1, 2005.On July 3, 2007, President Bush delegated his authority to invoke the waiver provision in Section 127 to his science advisor, Dr. Marbuger, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House. In a January 22, 2008 memo, Dr. Marburger announced his decision to invoke the Section 127(f) waiver. A technical paper on the issue of KI was prepared by the Federal Radiological Protection Coordinating Committee KI Sub-Committee at the request of Dr. Marburger as part of his determination process.",https://www.nukepills.com/nuclear-reactor-maps/,

Other notable NPP accidents include Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979 and Chernobyl in Soviet Ukraine in 1986. The inescapable risk associated with a NPP is substantially amplified when that risk is coupled with any geological or other natural hazards, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood, or other catastrophic event. On 11 March 2011, a massive earthquake registering a 9.0 magnitude triggered a tsunami that washed up on the coast of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, where the Fukushima NPP is sited. The earthquake caused a blackout, which brought down the cooling system for the reactors’ nuclear fuel rods. The collapse of cooling resulted in the release of radioactive materials into the environment (Baba 2013). The Fukushima NPP was not designed to withstand such a tsunami, despite having been sited near the coast in a tectonically active zone (Acton and Hibbs 2012). Designed to accommodate a tsunami-driven surge estimated to be at most 3.1 m above sea level, the seawater intake was built at 4 m above sea level. The building was built 10 m tall, on a cliff that rises 25 m above the shoreline. During the event, the seawater pumps were inundated when a 14 m high wave washed over the coastline. According to Kan (2013), cost savings was the underlying motive behind the decision of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPC) to go forward with such a low projected height for a tsunami-driven surge in its design and construction of the Fukushima NPP. In the long-run, the pay-off from the cost savings came with a price tag far beyond anything one could possibly have imagined.The immediate threat from any NPP-related disaster comes in the form of ionizing radiation emitted from the core, where the nuclear fuel rods are housed. As part of their normal, day-to-day operations, NPPs emit low levels of ionizing radiation that may pose health risks to those living in proximity and subject to prolonged exposure (Blevins and Andersen 2011). In general, the ionizing radiation emitted from NPPs has been linked to various forms of cancer, permanent damage to human vital organs, and death (Astakhova et al. 1998; Cardis et al. 2005; Canu et al. 2008; Anzai et al. 2012). The Fukushima NPP began to release significant excess radiation into the atmosphere the day after the accident (Thakur et al. 2013; Baba 2013).In the event of a nuclear disaster, ionizing radiation can quickly travel over great distances as the wind carries a radioactive-effluent plume over outlying areas (Cyranoski and Brumfiel 2011). In the aftermath of the event at Fukushima, such radioactive effluents were released in two forms—gaseous and liquid. These effluents included isotopes of noble gases such as xenon (133Xe), krypton (85Kr), iodine (131I, 132I), cesium (134Cs, 136Cs, 137Cs), and tellurium (132Te). Due to the high levels of radiation released, the Fukushima accident ranked as a level-7 event according to the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), where 1 is abnormal and 7 represents a major accident (Thakur et al. 2013). In addition, a large but unknown amount of highly contaminated water was discharged from the three reactors and eventually made its way into the ocean and groundwater (Baba 2013). The amount of water discharged into the ocean was and remains unknown, and TEPC has since informed the public that water that had leaked from one of the more than 1000 storage tanks at the site was found to have radiation levels sufficient to kill a person within 4 h of exposure (Lazare 2013). An estimated 80,703 gallons of contaminated groundwater continues to flow into the ocean daily (Yamaguchi 2013).United States commercial NPPs are vulnerable to natural hazard events. When impacted by such a hazard, it is likely that many would prove unable to withstand the event (Cappiello and Donn 2011). Given the number of “near-miss” events recorded over the past 3 years, there would seem to be ample potential for an accident to occur that, with better preparation and strengthened safeguards in place, could have been avoided. The severity of any such accident and its negative impacts on the lives of the people living in the nearby communities would be difficult to overestimate. Evaluation tasks are immense and complex, and cleaning up radioactive contamination requires international experts, immense financial resources, and decades, if not centuries, as the Japanese case is illustrating all too clearly.The communities that host NPPs inevitably bear the burden of the persistent risks associated with them. In instances in which the host communities were not allowed to participate in the decision-making process that resulted in a NPP being sited in their area, the communities have had to involuntarily bear the risk of negative environmental impacts deriving from the plant, thus raising a number of environmental justice issues.In the early years of civilian nuclear power, between 1957 and 1975, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) oversaw the NPP siting process. The AEC was founded under the Atoms for Peace program, which was later transformed into the Price-Anderson Act of 1957 (Hochfelder 1999). Under the AEC’s guidelines, appropriate site selection was based on Part 100 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which included three key criteria—exclusion area, low-population zone, and population center distance (Greenberg and Krueckeberg 1974). The AEC’s decision making in the siting process saw it exposed to criticism for its having to play dual roles, as both promoter and regulator of nuclear energy (Golay et al. 1977), and for the vagueness of these three key terms (Greenberg and Krueckeberg 1974). Of course, the idea of environmental justice did not exist during the era of AEC administration, so one cannot expect their guidelines to have considered issues of social equity. During its administration, the AEC issued operating licenses for 126 reactors, of which 103 remained in operation, 22 had been shut down, and one was temporarily closed as of August 2012 (U.S. NRC 2012c).In 1970, the New Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) went into effect and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established. Part of the EPA’s mission was to incorporate environmental justice policy into all federally sponsored projects. In 1975, after take into consideration criticisms of the AEC, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was founded by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (U.S. NRC 2011b). The NRC was given sole responsibility for the licensing of all nuclear power reactors in the country through a two-step licensing process, which included both a construction and an operating license application (U.S. NRC 2012c). By law, public participation in the licensing process was encouraged through adjudicatory (or courtroom-style) hearings that disclosed the proposed plant’s conformity with existing environmental law and any quality of design and construction issues (Mariottee 2006). After 1992, the licensing process was reorganized into a single step. The new, simplified, one-step process has been the subject of some criticism, however, as it placed greater constraints on public participation and bestowed more advantages upon nuclear operators. Public participation was seen to be discouraged by the requirement of legitimate contentions for each public hearing by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB), a three-judge panel of NRC employees made up of two technical experts and one attorney. The time frame during which the public was able to file such contentions was limited to a 60-day window, and the high costs of attorney’s fees and the fees needing to be paid to expert witnesses also acted to limit the public’s ability to intervene in the licensing process (Mariottee 2006). These procedural limitations might have contributed to decisions made around environmental justice issues that have since negatively impacted the health and wellbeing of people living near the power plants.Environmental equity studies emerged out of the then-nascent environmental justice movement in the U.S. South in the early 1980s. The emergence of anti-NPP movements, however, preceded the environmental justice movement by more than 20 years, linked to preexisting antinuclear-weapons movements of the 1950s (Gottlieb 2005). Beginning in the 1960s, broad antinuclear technology movements began to contest the siting of NPPs at various locations in the United States over concerns of ionizing radiation and the plants’ potential for nuclear accidents (Gottlieb 2005). Contested sites included: Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Maryland; Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, New Hampshire; Diablo Canyon Power Plant, California; Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, North Carolina; and Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, Pennsylvania (Giugni 2004). With the cessation of construction of new NPPs in the United States as of the 1980s, the anti-NPP movement substantially slowed but nuclear power remained a potent local concern, especially in those communities that already hosted nuclear facilities (Gottlieb 2005).While justice and equity were not part of the discourses of the previous antinuclear power campaigns, they do figure prominently in environmental justice studies. According to Bullard’s definition (1996), environmental justice refers to the equal protection from environmental harms of all peoples, regardless of race, sex, income, and age. This definition emphasizes equity as essential to environmental justice. According to Margai (2010), environmental equity has a broader context and engages with the geographical and spatial distribution of environmental risks. For Bullard and colleagues, environmental equity can be distilled into three categories—namely, procedural, geographic, and social equity (Bullard et al. 2007). Procedural equity concerns fairness in environmental decision-making processes, which is often examined by looking into how and whether rules, regulations, and systematic evaluation criteria are applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory way. Geographic equity investigates whether environmental risks are equally distributed according to the spatial location of communities and their proximity to potentially hazardous and/or toxic facilities. Social equity evaluates how sociological factors—such as race, ethnicity, class, culture, lifestyle, and political power—influence environmental decision making. With its focus on proximity-based assessment, the present study focuses on two types of equity—namely, geographic and social—in attempting to answer the research questions presented below.With a primary goal of addressing environmental justice issues, President Clinton in 1994 signed Executive Order 12,898, which required each federal agency to have a plan “that identifies and addresses disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities,” and to “make environmental justice a part of all they do” (Bowen et al. 1995, p. 641). The 65 NPPs currently operating in the United States, however, all were built between 1964 and 1978 (U.S. NRC 2011b), well before President Clinton’s Executive Order was put into effect. That Executive Order now provides grounds for environmental justice assessments based on the current guidelines in place for the NPP siting process as defined by the NRC. The siting decisions of the U.S.-based NPPs currently in operation therefore were made in a period during which the inequitable impacts of industrial hazards simply were not considered in the procedures for the selecting of appropriate sites. Given the by now well-documented evidence that, in many cities, hazardous industries are disproportionately located in areas with predominantly poor and minority populations, the question that naturally follows is: Do NPPs exhibit similar patterns of inequitable proximity to low-income and racial minority populations?The primary goal of this study is to investigate the potential environmental risks borne by the communities living in proximity to the 104 nuclear reactors at 65 NPPs currently operating in the United States. In particular, this study examines whether minorities and the poor are overrepresented in host communities. Consistent with the emergency evacuation guidelines set forth by the NRC (U.S. NRC 2011a), this study considers two exposure zones that mirror the two emergency planning zones (EPZs) the NRC calls for to surround any NPP: the plume-exposure pathway EPZ, which is the area within a 10-mile radius of a NPP; and, the ingestion pathway EPZ, which is the area within a 50-mile radius. There is no publicly available historical data on different radiation dosage levels as sorted by distance from NPPs that could be used in order to estimate the extent of risk by distance. Therefore, the present study uses a proximity-based assessment of NPPs and measures equity in terms of the distribution of outcomes. Proximity-based assessment focuses on exposure to risk arising from the presence of a hazardous or toxic facility and makes no attempt to analyze the extent of the risk (Cutter et al. 1996; Bolin et al. 2002)—that is, the assumption is made that, all else being equal, living closer to a NPP is riskier than residing in a more distant location.In order to achieve the primary goal to this study, the author sought an answer to the following question: Are the disparities in the sociodemographic characteristics of the populations of communities within a 50-mile radius of a NPP greater than the same disparities of populations living in communities that are outside of a 50-mile radius from a NPP?",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-015-0064-3,
"People can use food stamps for anything, including to go to Hawaii, and even millionaires can qualify.",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/01/Is-Newt-right-Food-stamps-can-take-you-to-Hawaii/,False,False,False,True,False,False,"this was money spent on eligible food items -- not, as Gingrich suggested, on transportation to Hawaii.",Newt Gingrich says you can use food stamps to get to Hawaii,"In an appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Nov. 30, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich reiterated one of the themes he often brings up on the campaign trail -- food stamps.  Gingrich garnered national attention in May when he said that President Barack Obama deserves to be called the most successful food stamp president in American history because 47 million Americans are on food stamps. (We ruled that claim Half True because Gingrich was close on the number but wrong in assigning so much of the blame to Obama.)  In his Council Bluffs speech -- at a slice the deficit pizza party sponsored by a group called Strong America Now -- Gingrich added a new twist. According to NBC News campaign embed Alexandra Moe, Gingrich said this:  Remember, this is the best food stamp president in history. So more Americans today get food stamps than before. And we now give it away as cash -- you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card, and the credit card can be used for anything. We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii. They give food stamps now to millionaires because, after all, don't you want to be compassionate? You know, the Obama model: isn't there somebody you'd like to give money to this week. That's why we're now going to help bailout Italy because we haven't bailed out enough people this week, the president thought let's write another check. After all, we have so much extra money.  We decided to check three separate claims:  Can food stamps be used for anything?  No. The food stamp program -- which, we should point out, has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008 -- has very precise rules about what can and cannot be paid for.  According to the Agriculture Department, which runs SNAP, households can use benefits to buy groceries or to buy seeds and plants which produce food. (In some places where subsistence fishing is the norm, such as remote areas of Alaska, recipients can also pay for nets, hooks, fishing line, rods, harpoons and knives.) And in some areas, restaurants can be authorized to accept SNAP benefits from qualified homeless, elderly, or disabled people in exchange for low-cost meals.  But in general, SNAP funds cannot be used for restaurant meals. Other types of foods and beverages cannot be paid for with SNAP funds, including beer, wine or liquor; vitamins; food that will be eaten in the store; or hot foods.     According to the rules, pumpkins are edible and eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. However, inedible gourds and pumpkins that are used solely for ornamental purposes are not eligible items. And items such as birthday and other special occasion cakes are eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits as long as the value of non-edible decorations does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the cake.  Gingrich is partly right when he says that today, you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card. The old system of using coupons is past; recipients now receive what’s called an electronic benefits transfer card, or EBT card. This looks like a credit card, but it doesn’t allow for purchases on credit. It’s really more like a debit card, with the government periodically uploading the proper amount of cash.  In addition to cutting administrative costs, EBT cards allow for easier oversight, and they remove some of the stigma of having to pay with food stamps. In addition, the system can tell at the checkout line which products qualify and which ones don’t. The ones that don’t must be paid for with cash. This amounts to one more way to guard against the possible misuse of funds.  We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii.  If the food stamp system bars beneficiaries from buying decorative gourds rather than pumpkins, you can be sure it also bars the purchase of airline tickets. (Our guess: The benefit amount would be less than the tickets anyway.)  There is undoubtedly some illegal bartering of EBT cards -- though I understand trafficking in EBT cards is less than under the old food stamps -- but I am having trouble imagining how you could barter an EBT card for an airplane ticket, said Julia Isaacs, a child and family policy fellow with the Brookings Institution.  We do at least have a pretty good idea where this notion came from.  In March, the St. Louis television station KMOV did an investigative piece looking at the Missouri food stamp system. It asked the state Department of Social Services for the states where food stamp money was spent.  Current law allows food stamp funds to be spent out of state. This makes sense for recipients who live close to another state, since they may find less expensive groceries across state lines. What the TV station noticed is that some of the expenditures were spent beyond Missouri’s immediate neighbors.  One of the states the report cited was Hawaii. In Hawaii, Missouri EBT cardholders spent $2,737 on food in January 2011, the station reported.  A couple of immediate points:  First, this was money spent on eligible food items -- not, as Gingrich suggested, on transportation to Hawaii.  Second, the amount was trivial. The total amount spent on food stamps by Missouri that month was $3,884,657, meaning that the amount spent in Hawaii amounted to seven hundredths of 1 percent of the total.  Third, there are two reasons why a food stamp eligible Missouri resident might have good reason to be spending money in Hawaii, and neither involves tropical vacations. One is that the recipient is in the military and was recently transferred to a new duty base. Until new benefits are set up in Hawaii, the servicemember would be able to use the Missouri card for benefits. Alternately, the food stamp user could be a migrant worker who spends part of the year in Missouri but works seasonal jobs in Hawaii.  They give food stamps now to millionaires.  Food stamps have always been a means-tested program. Benefits vary by household size -- the full details are here -- but the national rule is that you can’t earn more than 130 percent of the poverty line. That would clearly rule out millionaires.  According to USDA, in 2010, about 43.2 of households on food stamps had gross incomes at 50 percent or less of the poverty line. A full 85 percent had gross incomes below 100 percent of the poverty line. The remaining 15 percent were between 100 percent and 130 percent of poverty, often elderly beneficiaries on fixed incomes.  People above the income ceiling could certainly receive benefits under false pretenses, but doing so would be illegal. Is it possible to be a millionaire and legally receive food stamps? We found one way -- but it’s ridiculously improbable. You’d have to own a million-dollar house but have no other income, and live in a state with sufficiently lenient enforcement to allow it. (Principal residence values, among other assets, are not counted in determining eligibility.)  I would challenge Newt Gingrich to find a millionaire in annual income who gets on food stamps legally, said Michael Wiseman, a public policy professor at George Washington University.  Our ruling  Each of Gingrich’s claims about food stamps is so ridiculous -- especially for a self-styled policy wonk -- that we wondered whether he was really intending to be serious. (By publication time, we did not receive answers to several queries made to his press staff.) But the transcript makes it sound like he wasn’t joking, so we’ll assume he wasn’t. For being so ridiculously wrong in so many ways, we rate his statement Pants on Fire.Update: After we published this item we heard back from USDA spokesman Aaron Lavallee. Lavallee said there was one case in which an unemployed Michigan man who won $2 million in the lottery was deemed eligible for food stamps by the state. He was later removed from the program. Given the isolated nature of the incident and the fact that he was removed from the program, our ruling remains Pants on Fire.",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/01/newt-gingrich/Gingrich-says-use-food-stamps-Hawaii/,

To get SNAP benefits, households must meet certain tests, including resource and income tests:Households may have $2,250 in countable resources, such as a bank account, or $3,500 in countable resources if at least one person is age 60 or older, or is disabled.  However, certain resources are NOT counted, such as a home and lot, the resources of people who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the resources of people who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and most retirement (pension) plans. The procedures for handling vehicles are determined at the state level. States have the option of substituting the vehicle rules used in their TANF assistance programs for SNAP vehicle rules when it results in a lower attribution of household assets. A number of States exclude the entire value of the household’s primary vehicle as an asset. In States that count the value of vehicles, the fair market value of each licensed vehicle that is not excluded is evaluated. Currently 32 State agencies exclude the value of all vehicles entirely. 21 State agencies totally exclude the value of at least one vehicle per household. The 2 remaining states exempt an amount higher than the SNAP’s standard auto exemption (currently set at $4,650) from the fair market value to determine the countable resource value of a vehicle. For more information concerning State specific vehicle policy, check with the State agency that administers the SNAP program.Households have to meet income tests unless all members are receiving TANF, SSI, or in some places general assistance. Most households must meet both the gross and net income tests, but a household with an elderly person or a person who is receiving certain types of disability payments only has to meet the net income test. Households, except those noted, that have income over the amounts listed below cannot get SNAP benefits.Gross income means a household's total, non-excluded income, before any deductions have been made. Net income means gross income minus allowable deductions.* SNAP gross and net income limits are higher in Alaska and Hawaii.How Much Could I Receive?  Allotments for households in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.The amount of benefits the household gets is called an allotment. The net monthly income of the household is multiplied by 0.3, and the result is subtracted from the maximum allotment for the household size to find the household's allotment. This is because SNAP households are expected to spend about 30 percent of their resources on food.Benefits will be provided from the day the household applies.SNAP benefits are available to all eligible households regardless of race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefsIn general, people must meet work requirements in order to be eligible for SNAP.  These work requirements include registering for work, not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing hours, taking a job if offered, and participating in employment and training programs assigned by the State.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in disqualification from the Program.In addition, able bodied adults without dependents are required to work or participate in a work program for at least 20 hours per week in order to receive SNAP benefits for more than 3 months in a 36-month period.Some special groups may not be subject to these requirements including: children, seniors, pregnant women, and people who are exempt for physical or mental health reasons.Most SNAP rules apply to all households, but there are a few special rules for households that contain an elderly or disabled member.A person is elderly if he or she is 60 years of age or older.Generally, a person is considered to be disabled for SNAP purposes if he or she:How do I Get SNAP benefits?A member of your household can apply for SNAP benefits at the local State or county office or by visiting the State agency’s website and completing an online application. The State agency information should be listed in the government section of the local telephone book. This is generally the quickest way to find the local office. If that doesn't work, try calling the SNAP Hotline for your State. Most of them are toll free numbers.If you are unable to go to the local office or do not have access to an internet-ready computer, you may have another person, called an authorized representative, apply and be interviewed on your behalf. You must designate the authorized representative  in writing.Normally a household must file an application form, have a face-to-face interview, and provide proof (verification) of certain information, such as income and expenses. The office interview may be waived if the household is unable to appoint an authorized representative and no household member is able to go to the office because of age or disability. If the office interview is waived, the local office will interview you by telephone or do a home visit. A home visit must be scheduled beforehand with the household.Everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together is grouped together as one household. However, if a person is 60 years of age or older and he or she is unable to purchase and prepare meals separately because of a permanent disability, the person and the person's spouse may be a separate household if the others they live with do not have very much income.  (More than 165 percent of the poverty level.)Some people who live together, such as husbands and wives and most children under age 22, are included in the same household, even if they purchase and prepare meals separately.Normally people are not eligible for SNAP benefits if an institution gives them their meals. However, there is one exception for elderly persons and one for disabled persons:What Resources Can I Have (and Still Get SNAP Benefits)?Households may have $2,250 in countable resources, such as a bank account, or $3,500 in countable resources if at least one person is age 60 or older, or is disabled. However, certain resources are NOT counted, such as a home and lot, most retirement (pension) plans, the resources of people who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI),  the resources of people who receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) (formerly AFDC), and, up to $4,650 of the fair market value of one car per adult household member (and one car per teen-aged household member if the teenager is using it to go to work, look for work, or prepare for work). If a vehicle is needed to transport a physically disabled household member, its value is not counted. The resources of people who get SSI and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) are not counted at all.  An important exception to this is that in the State of California SSI recipients are not eligible for SNAP benefits, because they receive a State supplement to their SSI benefits in lieu of SNAP benefits.What Are the Income Limits?Most households have to meet both a monthly gross income test and a monthly net income test to be eligible for SNAP benefits. However, households in which all members are receiving SSI or TANF are considered to be eligible based on income. Other households with one or more elderly or disabled members only have to meet the net income test. Net income is gross income minus certain deductions.The allowable deductions are: a standard deduction for all households; a 20% earned income deduction; a deduction for dependent care costs when necessary for work, training, or education; a deduction for legally owed child support payments; a deduction for medical costs for elderly and disabled people; and an excess shelter cost deduction.States issue SNAP benefits through local State or county offices to households that are eligible to receive them. Clients who are eligible for SNAP benefits receive benefits through an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. Benefits are automatically loaded into the household's account each month. The local office gives the eligible household the SNAP EBT card so the household can buy groceries at authorized food stores. The card works like a bank debit card. The cost of the eligible food items is deducted from the household's account automatically.

For elderly members and disabled members, allowable medical costs that are more than $35 a month may be deducted unless an insurance company or someone who is not a household member pays for them. Only the amount over $35 each month may be deducted. Allowable costs include most medical and dental expenses, such as doctor bills, prescription drugs and other over-the-counter medication when approved by a doctor, dentures, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses, and nursing care. They also include other medically related expenses, such as certain transportation costs, attendant care, and health insurance premiums. The costs of special diets are not allowable medical costs. Proof of medical expenses and insurance payments is required before a deduction for these expenses may be allowed.Shelter deduction. The shelter deduction is for shelter costs that are more than half of the household's income after other deductions. Allowable shelter costs include the costs of rent or mortgage, taxes, interest, and utilities such as gas, electricity, and water. For most households, there is a limit on the amount of the deduction that can be allowed, but for a household with an elderly or disabled member all shelter costs over half of the household's income may be deducted.States issue SNAP benefits through local State or county offices to households that are eligible to receive them. States issue SNAP benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT). The household pays for its groceries at authorized food stores (almost all food stores are authorized) by using the EBT card at the checkout counter. It works like the bank debit card that other people use to pay for their groceries in increasing numbers of stores. The cost of the groceries bought is deducted from the household's account automatically. Most other people in line will not notice that the person checking out is paying with SNAP benefits. We have found that SNAP households like this feature, because it reduces the stigma many people feel in using SNAP.A second advantage is that the household no longer needs to go anywhere to pick up benefits each month. Benefits are automatically loaded into the household's account each month on the designated date.

And do i get them as an european r do i have to be mexican ? :<I can say one thing...millionaires do not receive food stamps. They got bail outs instead. We finally get a COLA this year, but that means that our food stamps will go down to about $45 a month. Unless Obama does some magical new percentage for those under the poverty line. Making more people able to qualify for SNAP.   Now, what Newt really meant was that people who receive CASH assistance every month can use their cards like a credit card and they can book trips to Hawaii by saving up that money. Kind of like it is a savings account. Now if they are saving a few dollars a month towards something nice, like a vacation, how is that wrong? I do agree that would be wrong if they were using ALL of the benefits and not paying their bills with it in leu of a vacation.In fact some of what Newt said is true he just doesn't have his facts right.   1.You really could be a millionaire and get food stamps! You can be self employed and declare as much income as you wish. The system does not require you to prove your income when you're self employed, you just declare what you want. The only way they can verify is through the department of labor if you paid into that system.   2. The EBT card is not just for food stamps. It is the same card they put family cash assistance on and that cash money can be used anyplace and for anything.. It could be used to purchase airline tickets, a cruise or anything!!he was talking about selling the money you get from food stamps and using it to go to hawaii. you can do that - thats what my mom saidIs Newt really that f*cking stupid?

Newt Gingrich on Wednesday, November 30th, 2011 in a speech in Council Bluffs, Iowa  Newt Gingrich says you can use food stamps to get to Hawaii      Can you enjoy the surf in Hawaii courtesy of federal food stamps? Newt Gingrich suggested you can.  In an appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Nov. 30, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich reiterated one of the themes he often brings up on the campaign trail -- food stamps.  Gingrich garnered national attention in May when he said that President Barack Obama deserves to be called the most successful food stamp president in American history because 47 million Americans are on food stamps. (We ruled that claim Half True because Gingrich was close on the number but wrong in assigning so much of the blame to Obama.)  In his Council Bluffs speech -- at a slice the deficit pizza party sponsored by a group called Strong America Now -- Gingrich added a new twist. According to NBC News campaign embed Alexandra Moe, Gingrich said this:  Remember, this is the best food stamp president in history. So more Americans today get food stamps than before. And we now give it away as cash -- you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card, and the credit card can be used for anything. We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii. They give food stamps now to millionaires because, after all, don't you want to be compassionate? You know, the Obama model: isn't there somebody you'd like to give money to this week. That's why we're now going to help bailout Italy because we haven't bailed out enough people this week, the president thought let's write another check. After all, we have so much extra money.  We decided to check three separate claims:  Can food stamps be used for anything?  No. The food stamp program -- which, we should point out, has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008 -- has very precise rules about what can and cannot be paid for.  According to the Agriculture Department, which runs SNAP, households can use benefits to buy groceries or to buy seeds and plants which produce food. (In some places where subsistence fishing is the norm, such as remote areas of Alaska, recipients can also pay for nets, hooks, fishing line, rods, harpoons and knives.) And in some areas, restaurants can be authorized to accept SNAP benefits from qualified homeless, elderly, or disabled people in exchange for low-cost meals.  But in general, SNAP funds cannot be used for restaurant meals. Other types of foods and beverages cannot be paid for with SNAP funds, including beer, wine or liquor; vitamins; food that will be eaten in the store; or hot foods.  According to the rules, pumpkins are edible and eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. However, inedible gourds and pumpkins that are used solely for ornamental purposes are not eligible items. And items such as birthday and other special occasion cakes are eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits as long as the value of non-edible decorations does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the cake.  Gingrich is partly right when he says that today, you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card. The old system of using coupons is past; recipients now receive what’s called an electronic benefits transfer card, or EBT card. This looks like a credit card, but it doesn’t allow for purchases on credit. It’s really more like a debit card, with the government periodically uploading the proper amount of cash.  In addition to cutting administrative costs, EBT cards allow for easier oversight, and they remove some of the stigma of having to pay with food stamps. In addition, the system can tell at the checkout line which products qualify and which ones don’t. The ones that don’t must be paid for with cash. This amounts to one more way to guard against the possible misuse of funds.  We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii.  If the food stamp system bars beneficiaries from buying decorative gourds rather than pumpkins, you can be sure it also bars the purchase of airline tickets. (Our guess: The benefit amount would be less than the tickets anyway.)  There is undoubtedly some illegal bartering of EBT cards -- though I understand trafficking in EBT cards is less than under the old food stamps -- but I am having trouble imagining how you could barter an EBT card for an airplane ticket, said Julia Isaacs, a child and family policy fellow with the Brookings Institution.   http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/...ps-Hawaii/  No. The food stamp program -- which, we should point out, has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008 -- has very precise rules about what can and cannot be paid for.

The Trail card is part of the federal food tamp program.Actual food stamps were phased out years ago in favor of a plastic card that beneficiaries can use like a credit card. More than $64 billion in food stamps were distributed in 2010, with most people receiving about $135 a month, and as of June 2011 45,183,931Americans were receiving federal food stamp assistance.A Safeway spokesman told FOX 12 they recently added the ability to use foodstamps in the Starbucks kiosk as a convenience to customers. Apparently the purchase works only in the grocery store Starbucks and not at stand-alone stores.SNAP restrictions prevent the card from being used to purchase hot food or anything that is pre-prepared, but people can purchase sweets, soft drinks, and even energy drinks if they have a nutritional label.Starbucks and Safeway aren't the only companies scrambling to get their share of that $64 billion in food stamp money. Early this fall Yum! restaurants Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut began their push to be included in the program.In Late November, however, the USDA  seemed to rebuke the Yum! campaign and said their agency was only interested in promoting healthy foods.Companies fighting to gain access to the program point out that homeless people using foodstamps don't have kitchens and still need hot food, and they should be the ones to sell it to them.",http://www.businessinsider.com/foodstamps-can-now-be-used-to-buy-starbucks-cfrappuccinos-and-muffins-2011-12,

After more than a decade of struggling to patch together a living, he directs TV segments for an Emmy-nominated documentary series now in its “umpteenth season” on a major network.But, he says, “I think I have economic PTSD.”This year he expects to gross $90,000, but he still can’t stop checking his bank account or worrying about a precipitous dip in his income next year.“I’m definitely fortunate,” he says, “but that could go away in a second.”Abdou sits in a mom-and-pop coffee joint in Los Angeles’ Echo Park neighborhood, gazing at his MacBook through thick square glasses and waiting for his next assignment. He knows it’s coming but his network isn’t paying him to wait, and he’s anxious.With almost no savings or retirement account, he’s not even close to being able to buy a house. “I pay for all my own benefits – medical and dental,” he says. “I’m 32 and this is the first year I’ve been able to have those things for the whole year.”Abdou isn’t alone. Some economists argue the traditional employee-employer relationship, which has undergone tectonic shifts since the 1980s — is going the way of the Leave It to Beaver family of the 1950s. In 2015 the federal General Accounting Office found that as many as 40 percent of Americans are considered independent contractors, day laborers, W-2 subcontractors, or work part-time or in temp jobs. All of the net job growth in the economy between 2005 and 2015 was in this sort of contingent work, according to a 2016 study by economists Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence Katz of Harvard. Some of these non-traditional workers lack basic protections like workers’ compensation or unemployment insurance, and most lack health insurance, sick pay or retirement.Many workers are on the outside looking in at the nation’s prosperity, argued Service Employees International Union Vice President David Rolf in an American Prospect article co-written earlier this year with venture capitalist Nick Hanauer. One way to change that: Offer so-called portable benefits – basic protections such as health care, retirement and sick pay — that would follow all workers from job to job.“Imagine an entirely new system,” Rolf and Hanauer wrote, “that substantially closes the gap left by the ongoing decline of secure full-time employment.”Indeed, advocacy for a new safety net for American workers gained traction two years ago, when the unlikely alliance between business and labor that the Prospect article described, called for more flexible benefits for workers who piece together an income from multiple sources or hop from gig to gig.In a single day a driver, for example, could earn contributions from both Uber and Lyft. If he logged on to TaskRabbit to do a home-repair job, he’d get a prorated benefit payment from that platform, too. Workers would choose their benefits from a menu and the whole system would be administered by nonprofits, professional associations, credit unions or labor unions.The founders of Lyft and the CEO of Care.com, along with other tech entrepreneurs who fuel multimillion and -billion dollar ventures with armies of gig workers lacking benefits, began to argue that all Americans deserved them.“A lot of them genuinely see the risk this poses ethically, economically, societally and politica lly,” says Ben Mangan, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “They like to fix a big problem.”The good news, says Nell Abernathy, a vice president at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, is this country is rich enough to pull people from the brink of economic collapse — where nearly half of Americans currently find themselves. In 2016, the Federal Reserve found that 46 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in case of an emergency. A new 21st-century social contract, in which basic benefits aren’t tied to employment, could change that and bring a raft of societal benefits along with it, Abernathy said. Clearly consumer spending would rise. But she noted there is evidence that financial security also boosts health outcomes, child development and entrepreneurship.In California, agricultural workers, writers and other creative types would be among the millions who would get some breathing space from the financial squeeze that has become their daily reality, Abernathy said.“There is a real moral case, but there’s simply an economic case that we will be better served as a nation if people can achieve their real potential.”“Not so fast, says Ken Jacobs, who chairs UC Berkeley’s Center for Labor Research and Education. While he sees nothing wrong with portable benefits and the security they’d bring, he thinks the scope of the problem is more limited than many portable benefits advocates argue it is. Economic inequality is real, and many people – even those with traditional jobs — lack basic benefits, he says. But he believes the speed at which the gig economy is growing is vastly overstated. And many gig workers lack benefits simply because their employers wrongly call them “independent contractors,” as opposed to company employees, and get away with it.A legal battle over who can properly be called a contractor is still raging. Two years ago, a National Labor Relations Board decision  appeared to put responsibility for contractors squarely on the shoulders of the bosses for whom they worked, but higher courts have disputed the labor board’s conclusion in some subsequent cases, and agreed in others.In fact, thousands of workers at tech companies like Uber, GrubHub and Amazon are suing those companies in class actions to demand the employee status that they say they’re legally due and the benefits that come with it. Earlier this year, Lyft paid out $27 million to settle a similar lawsuit, although under the settlement its drivers remain independent contractors.The economic upheaval that has left these gig workers and many others working without a safety net is due in part to an intense corporate focus on short-term profits, says Ben Mangan. A weakened labor movement is another factor (only six percent of private sector workers are unionized); so is the rise of technologies that allow companies to outsource work anywhere around the world. Today’s tech revolution is just as disruptive as the manufacturing boom of a hundred years ago that shifted work from farms to factories, says Nell Abernathy. And, just as they did a century ago, worker advocates are debating exactly how to offer basic worker protections in a changing economy.Ken Jacobs says that while he’s for state-administered health care and retirement, he’d also support worker-run funds for things like sick pay or vacation. Rolf backs a Washington state bill that would require companies to contribute 25 percent of a contract workers’ pay – up to $6 per hour — to a nonprofit portable benefit fund for workers’ compensation and other benefit options like retirement, health care or paid time off.A similar bill in the New York state legislature is backed by gig-employer Handy.com and would create portable benefits in exchange for recognition that the company’s fix-it workers and others are independent contractors.But, warns Jacobs, the bill is a dangerous one: “Details matter here. In exchange for portable benefits, are you granting these companies the ability to get out of [granting] benefits they would otherwise provide?”A major federal portable benefits program is what’s needed, Abernathy says, but such a plan is unattainable from the current administration and Congress. Rolf and Hanauer contend that portable benefits stand a better chance of gaining traction at the local and state levels. They argue the idea will eventually percolate upward to influence the national debate. Smaller-scale pilot programs are underway as well, with Department of Labor funding and grants from Google.org, the search giant’s philanthropic arm. In the U.S. Congress, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) has introduced a bill that would make $20 million in grants available to groups that would create a portable benefits pilot program.Among the first to benefit from such programs are nannies and house cleaners, who know something about precarious work, says Palak Shah, director of the National Domestic Workers Association’s Fair Care Lab. With a $1.5 million assist from Google.org and a smaller Department of Labor grant, UX designers and other tech types have built MyAlia.org, an online platform that allows multiple employers to contribute $5 per weekly house cleaning job to a single worker. Cleaners begin earning sick time immediately, and they can add other benefits like life, accident and disability insurance. (MyAlia is still being tested, so Shah hasn’t yet released data on the platform or its users.)“You could say domestic workers are the original gig workers,” Shah says. “We can be seen as the advance team for [a new] labor movement.”Fifty-eight-year-old Norma – she doesn’t want to use her last name — is one of them. Originally from Peru, she’s been a nanny for 17 years. She started her current job in a beach community south of Los Angeles nine years ago, before one of the two kids she cares for was born. She says she loves the children and takes pride in her work. She also knows her rights and isn’t afraid to speak up. Still, she doesn’t think she can convince the couple who employs her to pay for benefits. She earns just $12 an hour and hasn’t even been able to persuade her bosses to comply with California law, which requires overtime for domestic workers. “They’re good people,” she says. “But they’re tight with a buck.”For now, Norma doesn’t see her employers agreeing to spend more money on her. “There’s a lot of competition. Someone is always willing to work for $10 an hour.” And, at the more prosperous end of the economy, TV director Sami Abdou expresses the same sentiment. He says his bosses have even stopped handing out swag and throwing wrap parties.The Roosevelt Institute’s Nell Abernathy is optimistic, however.“All those experiments need to happen and all will get us to a place of innovation that points the way forward,” she says. “The endgame needs to be widespread safety.”",https://capitalandmain.com/newts-twisted-facts-about-food-stamps,

Go try and figure it out from the legislative language and you’re not likely to believe me. Fortunately, Joy Johnson Wilson, Health Policy Director for the National Conference of State Legislatures, has done the dirty work. In a handy document Wilson summarizes Medicaid and CHIP provisions in the new law and compares them to current law.In particular, on page 8 Wilson notes that the ACA “[r]equires states to use a net income standard (no asset or resource test, no income disregards) to determine [Medicaid] eligibility.” Yep, you read that right, bye-bye asset test. Hello simple income test. The new federal income eligibility threshold will be 133% of the federal poverty level (effective 1/1/14).Essentially, the Medicaid expansion under the ACA will broaden Medicaid eligibility for low-income, non-elderly adults without regard to assets. A major exception for that age group are those with incomes above the threshold but with high out-of-pocket medical costs. Such individuals will be required to spend their assets down to the existing asset limit, which varies by state and is typically a few thousand dollars.There are a few other caveats. Existing rules, including the asset tests, will continue to apply for individuals obtaining Medicaid eligibility through another program (e.g. foster care children, or SSI/SSDI recipients) and the elderly.Medicaid qualification just got a whole lot easier (or, rather, it will in 2014).",https://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/bye-bye-medicaid-asset-test/,

In her response on CNN, Rachel Held Evans noted that Ramsey and Corley mistake correlation for causality when they suggest (without actually proving) that these habits are the cause of a person’s financial situation. (Did it never occur to them that it might be the other way around?)Ramsey fired back, calling the pushback “immature and ignorant.” This from a guy who just made 20 sweeping assertions about 47 million poor people in the US — all based on a survey of 361 individuals.That’s right. To come up with his 20 habits, Corley talked to just 233 wealthy people and 128 poor people. Ramsey can talk all he wants about Corley’s research passing the “common-sense smell test,” but it doesn’t pass the “research methodology 101” test.To balance the picture a bit, I wanted to take a fact-based look at 20 things the poor do on a daily basis…1. Search for affordable housing.  Especially in urban areas, the waiting list for affordable housing can be a year or more. During that time, poor families either have to make do with substandard or dangerous housing, depend on the hospitality of relatives, or go homeless. (Source: New York Times)2. Try to make $133 worth of food last a whole month.  That’s how much the average food stamp recipient gets each month. Imagine trying to eat well on $4.38 per day. It’s not easy, which is why many impoverished families resort to #3… (Source: Kaiser Family Foundation)3. Subsist on poor quality food.  Not because they want to, but because they can’t afford high-quality, nutritious food. They’re trapped in a food system that subsidizes processed foods, making them artificially cheaper than natural food sources. So the poor are forced to eat bad food — if they’re lucky, that is… (Sources: Washington Post; Journal of Nutrition, March 2008)4. Skip a meal. One in six Americans are food insecure. Which means (among other things) that they’re sometimes forced to go without eating. (Sources: World Vision, US Department of Agriculture)5. Work longer and harder than most of us. While it’s popular to think people are poor because they’re lazy (which seems to be the whole point of Ramsey’s post), the poor actually work longer and harder than the rest of us. More than 80 percent of impoverished children have at least one parent who works; 60 percent have at least one parent who works full-time. Overall, the poor work longer hours than the so-called “job creators.” (Source: Poverty and Learning, April 2008)6. Go to bed 3 hours before their first job starts.  Number 15 on Ramsey and Corley’s list was, “44% of [the] wealthy wake up three hours before work starts vs. 3% of [the] poor.” It may be true that most poor people don’t wake up three hours before work starts. But that could be because they’re more likely to work multiple jobs, in which case job #1 means they’re probably just getting to bed three hours before job #2 starts. (Source: Poverty and Learning, April 2008)7. Try to avoid getting beat up by someone they love.  According to some estimates, half of all homeless women in America ran away to escape domestic violence. (Source: National Coalition for the Homeless, 2009)8. Put themselves in harm’s way, only to be kicked to the streets afterward.  How else do you explain  63,000 homeless veterans? (Source: US Department of Veterans Affairs, updated to reflect the most recent data)9. Pay more than their fair share of taxes.  Some conservative pundits and politicians like to think the poor don’t pay their fair share, that they are merely “takers.” While it’s true the poor don’t pay as much in federal income tax — usually because they don’t earn enough to qualify — they do pay sales tax, payroll tax, etc. In fact, the bottom 20% of earners pay TWICE as much in taxes (as a share of their income) as do the top 1%. (Source: Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy, January 2013)10. Fall further behind.  Even when poverty is the result of poor decision-making, often it’s someone else’s choices that make the difference. If you experience poverty as a child, you are 3-4 times less likely to graduate high school. If you spend your entire childhood in poverty, you are 5 times less likely to graduate. Which means your future has been all but decided for you. (Sources: World Vision, Children’s Defense Fund, Annie E. Casey Foundation)11. Raise kids who will be poor.  A child’s future earnings are closely correlated to their parents’ earnings. In other words, economic mobility — the idea that you can claw your way out of poverty if you just try hard enough is, more often than not, a myth. (Sources: OECD, Economic Policy Institute)12. Vote less.  And who can blame them? I would be less inclined to vote if I didn’t have easy access to the polls and if I were subjected to draconian voter ID laws that are sold to the public as necessary to suppress nonexistent voter fraud. (Source: The Center for Voting and Democracy)13. When they do vote… vote pretty much the same as the rest of us.  Following their defeat in 2012, conservatives took solace by reasoning that they’d lost to a bunch of “takers,” including the poor, who voted for Democrats because they want free handouts from big government. The reality is a bit more complex. Only a third of low-income voters identify as Democrats, about the same for all Americans, including wealthy voters. (Sources: NPR, Pew Research Center)14. Live with chronic pain.  Those earning less than $12,000 a year are twice as likely to report feeling physical pain on any given day. (Source: Kaiser Health News)15. Live shorter lives.  There is a 10-14 year gap in life expectancy between the rich and the poor. In recent years, poor people’s life expectancy has actually declined — in America, the wealthiest nation on the planet.

Despite the common picture of inner city crack houses, drug use is pretty evenly spread across income groups. And rich people actually abuse alcohol more than the poor. (Source: Poverty and Learning, April 2008)17. Receive less in subsidized benefits than corporations.  The US government spends around $60 billion on public housing and rental subsidies for low-income families, compared to more than $90 billion on corporate subsidies. Oil companies alone get around $70 billion. And that’s not counting the nearly $60 billion a year in tax breaks corporations enjoy by sheltering profits offshore. Or the $700 billion bailout banks got in 2008. (Source: Think By Numbers)18. Get themselves off welfare as soon as possible.  Despite the odds, the vast majority of beneficiaries leave the welfare rolls within five years. Even in the absence of official welfare-to-work programming, most welfare recipients enroll in some form of vocational training. Why? Because they’re desperate to get off welfare.

Accomplish one single goal: stay alive.   Poverty in America may not be as dire as poverty in other parts of the world, but many working poor families are nonetheless preoccupied with day-to-day survival. For them, life is not something to be enjoyed so much as endured.These are the real habits of the poor, those with whom Jesus identifies most closely.[Note: For a followup to this post, see “Poverty is more than a matter of poor decision-making.“]",https://benirwin.me/2013/12/03/20-things-the-poor-do-every-day/,
"People can use food stamps for anything, including to go to Hawaii, and even millionaires can qualify.",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/01/Is-Newt-right-Food-stamps-can-take-you-to-Hawaii/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,How Much Money Do You Really Need?,"Everyday I run into new entrepreneurs who tell me about their “business venture” that is going to change the world. After they share this with me, I immediately ask them this one simple question:You can probably guess what the most common response is:I want to be rich!When I start digging deeper to find out why they want to make a lot of money, it’s almost always because they want to live a comfortable lifestyle so they don’t have to worry about money.That’s when I usually think to myself, “how much money does one really need to live comfortably?”Don’t get me wrong, I am also an entrepreneur because I want to make money, but I quickly learned that you don’t need as much money as you think to live comfortably.I have compiled some of the striking reader responses from this post, check it out here .I’m not going to tell you how much money I make each month, but I’ll tell you that I live a pretty comfortable lifestyle without stretching myself thin. Just for a moment, let’s look at my monthly expenses:Life insurance: $225 Mortgage (includes property tax and home owners dues): $3,000 Cable TV: $186 Electricity: $15 Gym: $50 Food: $1,000 (I eat out a lot) Partying: $1,000 (I work hard and play hard) Miscellaneous: $500 Total expenses: $5,976Some of you may think that I live a lavish lifestyle, and some of you may think that I live a frugal lifestyle. I personally think I am somewhere in the middle.I’m not married, I don’t have kids, I am currently single, and, overall, I think my expenses are pretty low compared to my income. I know if I got married and had kids, my expenses would shoot through the roof. I don’t know what those expenses would entail, but I am assuming that I would need a bigger house at the very least. Obviously, everything else would double, if not triple, in order to support a family (except the partying, of course).So, how much money do you really need? When I was younger, I quickly learned that anything above $15,000 in monthly income for me didn’t change my lifestyle. As long as I am single, I can easily live within my means and have a good amount of savings after taxes, assuming my income never dips below $15,000 a month. And if it does dip, I can cut back on my expenses to $3,500 a month.By no means am I saying that it’s easy to make money, but what I am saying is that you don’t need much to live a comfortable lifestyle. And if you do need big amounts of money, it’s because you are putting the added pressure on yourself by buying fancy cars, a really big home, and a variety of material possessions that you don’t need.Making millions of dollars is never an easy thing to do. It’s a lot harder to make money than it is to save it. For this reason, I am a big believer in living below your means so that you don’t have to stress about making more and more money each month.Heck, I even somewhat regret paying $3,000 a month for my home. I probably would have been better off paying $1,000 a month living in a 275-square-foot motel room (which I did for six months).The point I am trying to make is that you don’t need much money to live a comfortable lifestyle. If you are trying to be an entrepreneur to make millions of dollars, that’s great! But if you only need to make $10,000 or $20,000 a month to live a great lifestyle, there are much easier ways to make that money.If you still want to go down the entrepreneurial path, by all means, do so. I’ll even help you along the way. But if you are trying to just live a chill lifestyle, here are some other ways you can make a good living:Like I mentioned above, if you want to shoot for the stars and try to become a millionaire, by all means, go for it. If you just want to live a comfortable life, you don’t need to be an entrepreneur. You just need to find a high-paying job. 😉And if you are wondering why I still keep on working, it’s because:So, how much money do you really need? And why do you need it?P.S.

The Tax Foundation calculates each state’s tax burden by taking the total amount paid by the state’s residents in taxes, and dividing it by the total income of the state’s residents.The cost of living data is from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. According to their website, they “[derive] the cost of living index for each state by averaging the indices of participating cities and metropolitan areas in that state.”“The least expensive areas continue to be the Midwest and Southern States.”The amount each state spends on education per student, including teacher salaries, as well as data on “income inequality,” measured by the Gini coefficient, comes from the Census Bureau.Medicaid spending per recipient is from The Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Medicare spending per recipient is from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The average amount each state employee receives in pension benefits per year was ranked by using data from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College on defined benefit plans. Data on the average number of months of benefits received and the average monthly amount of cash assistance from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a welfare program that provides cash assistance to American families with dependent children, was obtained from the Administration for Children and Families.These are the states that love to “spread the wealth,” so to speak:10. California Average pension benefits: $24,398 Total per pupil spending: $9,657 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $3,367 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 30.3 percent No. of months of TANF received: 42.4 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $537California provides a large amount of cash assistance to the needy. Recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in the state receive $537 per month—the second largest amount in the country—and for 42.4 months—the 7th most months. California residents have one of the highest tax burdens in the country.9. Minnesota Average pension benefits: $16,304 Total per pupil spending: $11,098 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $8,435 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 40.7 percent No. of months of TANF received: 40 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $348As of 2008, Medicaid enrollees in Minnesota received the second largest amount in benefits in the country. However, the state has cut outlay to the program as stated in the 2012-2013 budget, meaning the state’s ranking in this category may soon change. Residents of the state have to pay a very large amount in taxes. The average citizen of Minnesota pays 10.3 percent of their income in state and local taxes, which is the seventh largest amount in the country.8. Alaska Average pension benefits: $18,632 Total per pupil spending: $15,552 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $7,453 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 27.0 percent No. of months of TANF received: 37.3 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $602Alaskans have the lowest tax burden in the country, paying just 6.3 percent of their income in state and local taxes. According to the Tax Foundation, “Before the Trans-Alaska pipeline was finished in 1977, taxpayers in Alaska bore the second-highest tax burden in the country. By 1980, with oil tax revenue pouring in, Alaska repealed its personal income tax and started sending out checks instead.”The state also doesn’t levy personal income tax or sales tax. Still, it manages to spend the third largest amount per pupil each year, provide the sixth largest amount in medicaid per beneficiary, and give the largest amount in monthly TANF assistance in the country.7. Connecticut Average pension benefits: $26,622 Total per pupil spending: $14,531 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $7,442 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 29.2 percent No. of months of TANF received: 26.7 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $413Connecticut has the highest per capita income in the country. Its residents also pay more than $5,000 a year on average in state and local taxes—the highest amount in the U.S. As a result, residents have the third highest tax burden in the country.In return, Connecticuters receive above average benefits. State employees who receive their pensions through the Connecticut State Employees Retirement System have the fourth highest average pension benefits. Students have the sixth highest amount spent on them. The state also has the fourth highest cost of living, and the second highest rate of “income inequality.”6. Hawaii Average pension benefits: $22,680 Total per pupil spending: $12,400 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $5,261 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 54.3 percent No. of months of TANF received: 46.7 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $518Hawaii, on average, covers 54.3 percent of workers’ previous weekly wages through unemployment benefits. This is the highest rate in the country. The state also provides, on average, the greatest number of months of TANF benefits, and the third highest average amount of cash assistance. Part of the reason for this is that Hawaii has — by a substantial margin — the highest cost of living in the country. The state also receives one of the largest amounts of federal funding per capita in the country. This is partly due to defense, but also because of its high rates of health and human services payments.5. Pennsylvania Average pension benefits: $20,662 Total per pupil spending: $12,512 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $6,937 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 39.4 percent No. of months of TANF received: 42 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $322Pennsylvania ranks high in a number of categories, but is not especially exceptional in any. It spends a large amount on education, health care, public pensions, and welfare. As a result, it has the tenth highest tax burden in the country, with residents spending an average of 10.1 percent of their income in state and local taxes.4. New York Average pension benefits: $17,459 Total per pupil spending: $18,126 Medicaid payments per beneficiary: $9,057 Pct. of weekly wages covered by unemployment benefits: 26.9 percent No. of months of TANF received: 43.9 Avg. TANF cash assistance per month: $499New York spends more than $18,100 per student on education each year, which is more than any other state in the nation. Approximately $12,500 of this is spent on teacher salaries and benefits alone. The state’s medicaid payments per beneficiary of $9,057 is the largest in the country, and more than $600 than the state that spends the second most.New York has the second largest state and local tax burden, and the third highest cost of living.See the rest of the list here.",http://www.theblaze.com/news/2011/12/07/the-are-the-top-10-states-that-give-the-most-money-benefits-to-their-residents/,

This is one of the most important and challenging decisions you’ll make in your life. When you decide to retire affects not only you, but it could have serious, long-lasting consequences for your family members, too. The answer is not the same for everybody, and I’m going to share some information that can help you make an informed decision based on your own personal situation.From a Social Security standpoint, you can start getting lower benefits as early as age 62, or you can delay retirement up to age 70 for your maximum monthly benefit amount.For example: Let’s say your full retirement age for Social Security benefits is 66, and your monthly benefit at that age is $1,000. Here’s what your monthly benefit would be, starting at different ages:At age 62, your benefit amount is about 25 percent lower than your full benefit at age 66. If you delay receiving your Social Security until age 70, the monthly amount is 32 percent more than you would get at full retirement age. From 62 to 70, that comes to a monthly increase of $570 or $6,840 a year.When to retire is a personal decision that you should base on factors such as your current cash needs, your health, and family longevity, whether you have other retirement income sources, and of course, your anticipated future financial needs and obligations. Remember, the average retirement will last for about 20 years, and Social Security benefits are typically adjusted annually for inflation to help maintain your standard of living.

Keep in mind that I originally published the article in 2010 — so, after adjusting for inflation, that number is equivalent to $45,000 in 2017 dollars.Even so, how can I make such a claim?Well, I live in Southern California; it’s one of the most expensive places to live in the United States. In fact, according to the Council for Community and Economic Research, Los Angeles currently has the seventh-highest cost of living in the US, behind only New York City, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, Seattle and San Diego.Even so, there are still millions of people living here right now that are making ends meet on $45,000 or less.I know if I had to, I could make it here too on that amount of money — and if I can live on an annual income of $45,000 here in Southern California, I’m certain I could make it most everywhere else in America, where the cost of living is significantly cheaper.How do I know for sure? Well, if you’re a regular Len Penzo dot Com reader, you know that I’ve been meticulously tracking every penny I’ve earned since 1997.Although I have a much more detailed breakdown, here is a top-level summary of just my key household expenses in 2016:Remember, most of these expenses should be considered conservative. Why? Because if I was making only $45,000 per year I would certainly work much harder to cut some of those costs down — starting with kicking my two teenagers off the auto insurance policy, which would reduce that bill by more than half.You can also bet I’d be much more vigilant about limiting our gasoline and utility bills. Likewise for the retail purchases. However, the biggest area where I could really cut corners is the grocery bill; although we do plan our dinner menus to save money, we rarely take advantage of coupons. We currently eat lots of steak and other expensive cuts of beef too, so I’m quite certain that I can easily cut our grocery bill by at least 25%.But, Len, what about the mortgage?Well, my mortgage payment is a bit less than $640. And although I bought my home almost 20 years ago, there are still places in Southern California where you can find a place to live for $1000 per month.With that in mind, if you add everything up, those basic expenses come to about $45,000 annually.Yes, I realize I still haven’t accounted for federal, state and social security taxes. But I’m certain I could offset whatever taxes would be deducted from my paycheck with the savings I’d get by reducing my other bills.Would my family be living like kings and queens? No.But we would be living in a respectable and comfortable home in Southern California, with four insured cars in the garage, and presentable clothes on our backs. We’d also go to bed each night with full bellies. Unfortunately, the downside is that there would be little money left over to put away toward my retirement, or an emergency fund in case my water heater broke.I admit, it’s not ideal. Clearly, it is a no-frills lifestyle; but it’s certainly not poverty either.So if you and your family are blessed with good health, but you find yourself still having trouble making ends meet on approximately $40,000 per year — and are truly serious about living within your means — I strongly suggest you reassess your situation and see where you can cut back on your expenses. After all, as these testimonials show, there are plenty of folks in America who have been able to live comfortably on less than $40,000 annually.Otherwise, you’ve really got nobody to blame but yourself.",http://lenpenzo.com/blog/id1283-if-you-cant-live-on-40000-per-year-its-your-own-fault.html,

Territorial gangsters (TGs) love to create systems that enable them to dominate and control their victims so they can live off the fruit of their labor like parasites or cannibals. They use the Social Security number to keep track of their victims. Other agencies, such as Credit Bureaus and Banks, also use the Social Security number (SS#) to identify people.The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution created a creature called a U.S. citizen - euphemism for victim or slave. U.S. citizens are subject to federal and other statutory jurisdiction. The TGs took many other steps to turn individuals into victims or slaves. One of these steps was the introduction of the Social Security system. Practically all these steps have been flagrantly fraudulent. The TGs like to operate on the basis that because you've applied for their SS# (and stated on the application that you're a U.S. Citizen), you are their slave and they own you and can tell you what to do or what not to do. They won't put it this way, but this is the basis on which they operate. Read Report #04: How to Find Out Who You Are for a better understanding of this.We advocate that you shift your economic activities into the real free market. However, it may still be necessary for you to use an SS# (or equivalent) for certain transactions. So, the more options you have available to you, the better, the more easily you can operate in the real free market. See Report #01: Introductory Freedom Guide for details.We also advocate that people correct their status from the equivalent of a slave, to that of a free sovereign individual. Understanding the nature of SS#'s (or, for non-Americans, the equivalent numbers that are assigned and used in other countries) is an essential step in this process. This report provides you with vital information to outwit territorial gangsters (TGs) and other bloodsuckers. Here are some of the areas covered: INFORMATION ON SOCIAL SECURITY Misconceptions abound regarding a Social Security card and number. Like a driver's license, its intended use was simple and direct. A Social Security number supposedly represents your private account to hold paid-in benefits for your old age. It was essentially a coerced savings program initiated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and was heralded at the time as a product of enlightened social conscience. Today, the Social Security system is broke, benefits provide a subhuman existence, and when it's time for you to retire, there will not be enough people paying in to foot the bill. So much for enlightenment.You've probably noticed that everyone wants your Social Security number these days. Schools, lenders, banks; everyone seems to want it. Why? Because it's an easy way for individuals and the government to identify and keep track of you. It's one number you're supposedly stuck with your whole life.Most people believe that the law requires you to have a Social Security number to work in the United States. As we shall later see, this isn't true. Nevertheless, the Privacy Act of 1974 requires that the SSN be provided for certain purposes.You must give your Social Security Number to the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. You are supposedly required to give your employer your Social Security Number in order for your employer to prepare the necessary tax records for the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration.In a nutshell, the law says, that no federal, state, or local government agency may deny you any right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to provide your Social Security number, unless there is a law or regulation on the books adapted prior to 1975 that specifically authorizes the demand for the number.Your employer by law cannot divulge your Social Security Number to anyone. In fact, the IRS cannot divulge your Social Security Number to anyone. The only thing that the IRS can verify is if the Social Security Number you are using is valid.That is why you may want to acquire a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) that is associated with your name. Then if anyone wants to verify the TIN with the IRS they will state that the TIN is valid to your name and the IRS cannot divulge any other information about you.You are not required to give your Social Security Number to anyone else, including creditors, hospitals, doctors, credit bureaus or any other private firm that wants to keep track of you.If you have to give an identification number, you should have a taxpayer identification number, (TIN) which you may acquire as outlined in this report - see pages 14-19. This taxpayer identification number can be used to set up your new Credit File and for other purposes. This taxpayer identification number (TIN) can only be acquired once in your lifetime, so be careful how you use it.If you want to try to secure a new Social Security number, it's possible and the information on pages 13-14 tells you how. Unfortunately, it's a lot more difficult and time-consuming than getting a taxpayer identification number (TIN).THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT Generally, dictionaries describe nexus as a connection, tie, or link between individuals of a group; or members of a series. TGs use the term to imply that someone is their slave in some respect. For example, a mailorder company operates from a certain state. The TGs of that state claim that the company has to pay sales taxes on sales made within that state - they have nexus in respect of those transactions. Generally the company doesn't have to pay sales taxes on sales made to other states. However, under certain circumstances the TGs claim that they have nexus even on sales made to some other states, for example, if the company has some kind of office or representative in those other states. But the main thing to understand is that when they say they have nexus over you, it means they regard you as their slave in some respect. The main purpose of the Social Security system is to turn people into slaves.The Social Security Act is a monstrous lie. It was created and devised and intended unjustly, fraudulently, and maliciously to deprive the individual of his/her birthright, good name and character, and to legally steal his wealth. Some people claim that the Social Security Act was a plot to rid the individual sovereign of his absolute rights, and, further that the underlying purpose was to render the individual subject to, and the object of, the tax laws and other related contractual obligations. The Social Security number is recognized by other nations and is prima facia evidence that:What is a conspiracy? A conspiracy is a combination, usually secret, of persons for evil or unlawful ends. Blackstone further stipulates that in law, conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons, falsely and maliciously to indict, or procure to be indicted, an innocent person of felony. The most approved manner of charging the conspiracy are the words, did conspire, combine, confederate and agree together. The Social Security system is a conspiracy to enslave the innocent.The following are excerpts relating to the Social Security Act. They are from theFollowing are additional excerpts from Title 18, U.S.C. and Social Security case law:In all the above named cases, the evidence before the court was:The terms, people, or human being are not to be found in the Internal Revenue Code and it fails to properly identify who is required to file. It cannot be found because it is not there. Partaking into the Social Security Act merely identifies one as a who is receiving benefits and therefore must meet the burden. Under the ancient concept of Lord Mansfield's maxim that no man shall enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another, in the eyes of the court, that individual ought to pay the income tax. The common law of quasi contract (as if a contract) is now in full force and effect.THE SIGNATURE OF A PERSON IS THE PROOF OF HIS CONSENT THAT BINDS HIM UNDER THE LAW OF CONTRACT. is defined as a connection, tie, or link between individuals of a group. The signature of each person, given voluntarily, binds the U.S. citizenry together into a lifelong socialized contract with the government.The law cannot be invoked when a citizen is not numbered, receives no benefits, and does not enrich himself at the expense of another. Without the law, the court cannot offer a remedy. When a court cannot offer a remedy, the court lacks jurisdiction.Under the Social Security Act, the citizen is in a state of voluntary servitude. Involuntary servitude is unconstitutional (13th Amendment), but voluntary servitude is constitutional (for every positive action there is a negative reaction). One has the absolute right to enter into a contract and bind himself to specific performance, submitting himself to the law of contracts and to the laws of the contract. Within the U.S., and any place subject to its jurisdiction, no one can force a citizen into a state of involuntary servitude unless for the punishment of crime whereas the party shall have been duly convicted (13th Amendment).No one can force a citizen into a contractual agreement. The judicial, executive, and legislative branches of the government do not have that power. A tax judge will always remind a litigant that there are no constitutional protection (i.e., right of free speech, privacy) in a tax court (when under contractual obligations). But no judge can order a citizen to participate in the Social Security system. The system is 100% voluntary and whoever joins the system also volunteers into paying the income tax. The following case law describes a valid, constitutionally valid tax return:When a fraud is discovered, the plaintiff must put the other party on notice of the fraud, as it applies to his case, and if he benefits from the fraud, no recovery can be had. When the party himself rescinds or repudiates the contract, he merely gives notice by that action to the other party to the contract that he does not propose to be bound by the contract. This he may do by his own action and he needs not turn to the courts. When, however, a court of equity grants rescission or cancellation, it wipes out the instrument, and renders it as though it did not exist; in effect, it tears up the paper and destroys it. A bill in equity to obtain a rescission is not like an action at law brought on the footing of a rescission previously completed; the foundation of the bill is that the rescission is not complete and that the plaintiff asks the aid of the court to make it so. (annot. 95 ALR 1001).Neither an agent of the government, nor a judge, nor a legislative officer, nor an executive officer, can cancel participation in the Social Security Act of any citizen. Nor is there a provision within the code that permits and/or does not permit a citizen to withdraw from the System. These provisions are lacking because participation in the system is a voluntary contract decided by the individual.All citizens who have rescinded their social security numbers by resorting to common law proceedings (i.e., by the mere filing of a document of asseveration recorded in the county courthouse) will most likely not be recognized by a court that proceeds in equity. But if the word fraud is implied, he can wait until sued upon and set the fraud up as a defense. If the relief asked is in equity then he who seeks equity must do equity (be given equity). The remedy that exists within the law must come from equity. (Equity: That part of law which administers and adjusts common-law rights where the courts of common law have no machinery.)The following legal maxims are relevant to the above issues:Today, every day, Americans are constantly confronted with greater and more frequent requests from all too many sources that they provide to the inquiring parties their Number of the Beast, the Social Security number (SSN). The examples of this modern day phenomenon are numerous and known to all. Many States are now moving to ostensibly require the display of SSNs upon drivers' licenses. Public school officials demand that school age children obtain SSNs before those children may be enrolled in any public school. Private parties of all kinds, from banks to employers, deem it essential that they obtain the SSN of everyone with whom they may conduct any business. With all these entities making these demands, surely the law must contain a requirement that everyone have the Number of the Beast.'' (Of course, there are a few cases which recognize objections to the SSN on First Amendment, freedom of religion grounds; see 428 F.Supp. 896 (E.D.N.Y., 1977); 658 F.2d 679 (9th Cir., 1981); and 736 F.2d 1269 (9th Cir., 1984).) Or, is it possible that everybody simply acts like lemmings, dutifully following the herd instinct without any question, assuming such requirement without any knowledge of it? More simply put, does the law demand that everybody apply for and obtain a SSN, or is such purported obligation nothing more than so much male bovine feces? (B.S.!)The first inquiry regarding the legal duty to apply for and obtain a SSN must involve an examination of the U.S. Constitution and the powers granted therein to Congress. Congress can only possess powers which are contained, expressly or by necessary implication, within the text of the Constitution, particularly Art. 1, section 8. Being straightforward and to the point, the problem here for Social Security is that no particular clause in this or any other article of the Constitution is sufficient to sustain such power to compel a domestic American to participate in a compulsory retirement or benefits scheme. The power to thus mandate participation in Social Security must therefore be one which is based upon an implied power.To determine if this power is one arising by implication, a study of various Supreme Court cases regarding the limits of Congressional power is essential. The States are arguably the governmental entities which might possess the inherent, municipal power to compel participation in a retirement scheme; but, if the states might have this power, an issue which appears to not have as yet been decided, does Congress have a corresponding power? Can Congress assume this inherent power of the State and claim it as its own?Examples of Supreme Court cases which place some real limits upon the powers of Congress are manifold. In the 72 U.S. 462 (1866), the Supreme Court held that Congress could not authorize the conduct of business within the States in order to tax that business. In , 76 U.S. 41 (1870), the Court held that a penal regulation in a tax act could not be enforced in a state. In 94 U.S. 315 (1877), the Court held that the United States could not receive property via a testamentary devise contrary to state law. In , 95 U.S. 670 (1878), a penal statute remotely related to bankruptcy laws was held inapplicable in the States. In 97 U.S. 501 (1879), the Court held that U.S. patent laws conferred no superior rights within the States. In 100 U.S. 82 (1879), federal trademark legislation unconnected with interstate commerce was held inapplicable inside the States. In 120 U.S. 678, 7 S.Ct. 656 (1887), certain penal, federal civil rights legislation was held unenforceable within a state. In 136 U.S. 586, 10 S.Ct. 850 (1890), and 201 U.S. 303, 26 S.Ct. 485 (1906), the Court held that domestic relations matters were solely state concerns. In 154 U.S. 413, 14 S.Ct. 1060 (1894), it was held that federally created corporations engaged in business in the States were subject to state laws. In 213 U.S. 138, 29 S.Ct. 470 (1909), it was held that Congress could not exercise police powers within the States. In 221 U.S. 559, 31 S.Ct. 688 (1911), it was held Congress could not dictate to a state, Oklahoma, where to locate its state capitol. In 247 U.S. 251, 38 S.Ct. 529 (1918), and 259 U.S. 20, 42 S.Ct. 449 (1922), the Court held that Congressional attempts to regulate and control manufacturing activities in the States were unconstitutional; see also 259 U.S. 44, 42 S.Ct. 453 (1922). In 259 U.S. 344, 42 S.Ct. 570 (1922), the Court held that Congress could not regulate coal mining in the States. In 268 U.S. 5, 45 S.Ct. 446 (1925), it was held that Congress could not regulate the practice of medicine in the States. In , 268 U.S. 64, 45 S.Ct. 403 (1925), the construction industry was deemed to be inherently of local concern and beyond Congressional powers. In 283 U.S. 570, 51 S.Ct. 601 (1931), the Court held that Congress could not impose a sales tax on items sold to state and local governments. Before the advent of Social Security, a statutorily mandated retirement system applicable to interstate carriers was held unconstitutional in , 295 U.S. 330, 55 S.Ct. 758 (1935). The case of 296 U.S. 315, 56 S.Ct.235 (1935), stands for the proposition that Congress cannot federalize state financial institutions over objection from the State. The cases of , 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837 (1935), 293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241 (1935), and 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855 (1936), emasculated most of the National Industrial Recovery Acts in part on the grounds of invasion of reserved powers of the States. In 297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312 (1936), the Court held that Congress had no direct power to regulate agricultural production within the States. Finally, in 400 U.S. 112, 91 S.Ct.260 (1970), it was held that Congress could not dictate voter qualifications to the States. The above decisions, as well as others, do place severe restraints upon the powers of Congress.The genesis of Social Security is the events of the Great Depression. While that era saw extraordinary unemployment and a tremendous decline in national production, still it was not as cataclysmic as other events in our nation's history, such as the War Between the States. Further, no constitutional amendment was adopted during this era which can offer any basis for an expansion of Congressional powers. The legislation which started Social Security in 1935 must be viewed in the light of the various Supreme Court cases decided within a few decades of that legislation and prior thereto. When Congress adopted the Social Security Act in 1935, the Supreme Court had already held in supra, that Congress had no authority to establish a retirement scheme through its most tremendous power, its control over interstate commerce. Additionally, the revolutionary acts of Congress adopted in the two preceding decades had been emasculated in a series of Supreme Court decisions. Are we to suppose that, against this legal background, Congress decided to enact legislation of the caliber which had been struck as unconstitutional in the same year?In the Social Security Act, Congress imposed excise taxes upon employers and those tax receipts were to be deposited with the Treasury. The act further provided schemes whereby participants could enjoy unemployment and retirement benefits. When the act was adopted, parties opposed thereto made challenges to the act, relying upon some, if not all, of the various cases cited above. The major arguments mounted against the act were premised upon invasion of state rights. In 301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883 (1937), an employer challenged the unemployment tax imposed upon it and the Court held that such tax was an excise which Congress could impose. In reference to the contention that the subject matter of the act was properly within the historical field reserved to the states, the Court held that Congress could enact legislation to aid the states in an area of great concern. The Court placed considerable emphasis upon the fact that the states were reluctant to adopt unemployment acts because such taxes created differentials between states which had such legislation and those which did not. By creating a national unemployment act, this difference was eliminated and a great benefit to the American people resulted. The Court, therefore, found nothing constitutionally objectionable to the act. In 301 U.S. 619, 57 S.Ct. 904 (1937), the same rationale was used to uphold the retirement features of the act. The importance of these two cases upholding the Social Security Act concerns the issues which these cases raised: neither of them addressed the issue of whether there was a requirement for any American to join Social Security. The reason that this issue was not raised is because there is no such requirement, unless of course one works for a state government which has contracted into Social Security; see 613 F.Supp. 558 (E.D. Cal.,1985), rev.,477 U.S. 41,106 S.Ct. 2390 (1986).The above review should readily demonstrate that there is indeed a real question concerning the point of whether one must submit an application to join Social Security. The cases which challenged the constitutionality of Social Security simply did not raise this issue, and it appears that no cases have as yet dealt with it. The reason for this absence of a challenge to such alleged requirement can only be explained by analyzing the act itself to determine if there is such a requirement. Because Congress lacks the constitutional authority to compel membership in Social Security, the act simply imposes no such requirement.The modern day act is codified at 42 U.S.C., sections 301-433. If there were a requirement that every American join the Social Security scheme, one would expect to find language in the act similar to the following: Every American of the age of 18 years or older shall submit an application with the Social Security Administration and shall provide thereon the information required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Every member of Social Security shall pay the taxes imposed herein and records of such payments shall be kept by the Secretary for determining the amount of benefits to which such member is entitled hereunder. Amazingly, no such or similar language appears within the act, and particularly there is no section thereof which could remotely be considered as a mandate that anyone join Social Security. The closest section of the act which might relate to this point is the requirement that one seeking benefits under the act must apply for the same. But, this relates to an entirely different point than a requirement that one join.Since the statutory scheme fails to impose such requirement, the next question to be asked is whether perhaps the Social Security regulations themselves might impose such duty. But here, the regulations are no broader than the act itself, and the duty to apply for and obtain a Social Security card or number boils down to the following found at 20 C.F.R., section 422.103:The purported duty to apply for and obtain a Social Security number therefore boils down to this: you get it if you need it or request it. There is no legal compulsion to do so.With the act of applying for and obtaining a SSN being entirely voluntary, the next question to be asked is whether any State can force you to use this number which is voluntary in the first place. This appears to have been addressed by section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 1896, which reads as follows:See U.S. v. Two Hundred Thousand Dollars in U.S. Currency, 590 F.Supp. 866 (S.D. Fla., 1984).Thus, it seems perfectly logical, if having a Social Security number is not mandatory but purely voluntary, no state can use the lack of a number in any adverse way against anyone. The state cannot make that which is voluntary under federal law something which is mandatory under state law.What should the American people do who are opposed to Social Security for whatever reason, be it the contention that it is the prelude to the Beast's number or any other? They should constantly inform those requesting the number that there is no obligation to have one.If I were a young man, 18 or 20 years old and just starting out in my first job, I would not want Social Security. With my signature on the application I would write, Without Prejudice, U.C.C. 1-207, and I would reserve my Common Law rights. But why wouldn't I want Social Security today? [UCC is the Uniform Commercial Code.]I got into the Social Security system in the 1930s, and I paid into it dollars that had good purchasing power. Now I'm getting a promised return in Federal Reserve Notes which have considerably less value. For example, in 1940 you could buy a deluxe Chevrolet for 800 dollars. With today's Federal Reserve Notes, that won't buy the rear fenders of a new Chevrolet. If I were a young man, I would not want to put Federal Reserve Notes into Social Security now, and get back something later like the German mark after World War I - when it took a billion to buy a loaf of bread. They will give you every Federal Reserve Note back that they promised you, but it might not buy anything.Assurance Under the Uniform Commercial Code, you have the right in to demand a guarantee of performance. So, don't go to them and say, I want to rescind my Social Security number, or I refuse to take it. Just take it easy and say, I would be happy to get a Social Security number and enter into this contract, but I have a little problem. How can I have assurance before I enter into this contract that the purchasing power of the Federal Reserve Notes I get back at the end of the contract will be as good as the ones that I pay in at the beginning. They can't guarantee that, and you have a right under the UCC to assurance of performance under the contract.So tell them, Well, I cannot enter this contract unless the government will guarantee to pay me at the end of the contract with the same value Federal Reserve Notes that I am paying in. Both may be called Federal Reserve Notes, but you know that these Federal Reserve Notes don't hold their value. I want assurance on this contract that the Federal Reserve Notes that I get in my retirement will buy as much as the ones that I'm giving you now in my working years. They can't make that guarantee. If they won't give you that guarantee, just say, I'd be glad to sign this, but if you can't guarantee performance under the contract, I'm afraid I cannot enter into the contract.Now, did you refuse or did they refuse? You can get the sections of the UCC which grant the right to have assurance that the contract you have entered will be fulfilled properly - that the return will equal the investment, and you can reject the contract using the Code. Using their own system of law, you can show that they cannot make you get into a contract of that nature. Just approach them innocently like a lamb.It's very important to be gentle and humble in all your dealings with the government or the courts - never raise your voice or show anger. In the courtroom, always be polite, and build the judge up - call him Your Honor. Give him all the honor he wants. It does no good to be difficult, but rather to be cooperative and ask questions in a way that leads the judge to say the things which you need to have in the record.The Court Reporter In many courts, there will be a regular court reporter. He gets his job at the judge's pleasure, so he doesn't want to displease the judge. The court reporter is sworn to give an accurate transcript of every word that is spoken in the courtroom. But if the judge makes a slip of the tongue, he turns to his court reporter and says, I think you had better leave that out of the transcript; just say it got a little too far ahead of you, and you couldn't quite get everything in. So this will be missing from the transcript.In one case, we brought a licensed court reporter with us and the judge got very angry and said, This court has a licensed court reporter right here, and the record of this court is this court reporter's record. No other court reporter's record means anything in this court.We responded with, Of course, Your Honor, we're certainly glad to use your regular court reporter. But you know, Your Honor, sometimes things move so fast that a court reporter gets a little behind, and doesn't quite keep up with it all. Wouldn't it be nice if we had another licensed court reporter in the courtroom, just in case your court reporter got a little behind, so that we could fill in from this other court reporter's data. I'm sure, Your Honor, that you want an accurate transcript. (I like to use the saying, give a bad dog a good name, and he'll live up to it!) The judge went along with it, and from that moment on, he was very careful in what he said.These are little tricks to getting around in the courtroom environment. This is how to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves when entering into the courtroom. Other people, using the same information presented here, end up in jail, handcuffed and hit over the head, because they approached the situation with a chip on their shoulder. They try to tell the judge what the law is and that he is a no-good scoundrel and so on. Just be wise and harmless.UCC 1-207 Review It's so important to know and understand the meaning of Without Prejudice, UCC 1-207, in connection with your signature, that we should go over this once more. It's very likely that a judge will ask you what it means. So please learn and understand and be able to explain it carefully:The use of Without prejudice UCC 1-207, in connection with my signature indicates that I have reserved my Common Law right not to be compelled to perform under any contract that I did not enter into knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally.And furthermore, I do not accept the liability associated with the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or commercial agreement.Once you state that, it's all the judge needs to hear. Under the Common Law, a contract must be entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally, by both parties, or it can be declared void and unenforceable. You are claiming the right not to be compelled to perform under any contract that you did not enter into knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally. And you do not accept the liability associated with the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or agreement.The compelled benefit is the privilege to use Federal Reserve Notes to discharge your debts with limited liability rather than to pay your debts with silver coins. It's a compelled benefit, because there are no silver coins in circulation. You have to eat, and you can only buy food with the medium of exchange provided by the government. You are not allowed to print your own money, so you are compelled to use theirs. This is the compelled benefit of an unrevealed commercial agreement. If you have not made a of your rights under UCC 1-207, and you simply exercise this benefit rendered by government, you will be obligated, under an implied agreement, to obey every statute, ordinance and regulation passed by government, at all levels - federal, state and local.See UCC 1-201. General Definitions (3) Agreement means the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance...SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER INFORMATION Let us briefly discuss the issue of the employee providing a Social Security number to the employer. We must take a practical and constitutional approach to this issue. What possible reason could there be for the employer to require the NON-TAXPAYER employee to furnish a Social Security number? The average payroll clerk would claim the number was needed so the employer would withhold Social Security taxes, undoubtedly. But if the employee's job description does not involve any revenue taxable activity, he is not subject to any of these indirect taxes under any circumstances. The right to lawfully contract one's own labor to engage in innocent and harmless activities for lawful compensation cannot be (and therefore has not been) taxed for revenue purposes. Surely, the free exercise of such a constitutionally secured right cannot be limited only to those individuals who furnish a number. Surely there can be no act of Congress which would require such a number to be furnished by a NON-TAXPAYER.The Internal Revenue Code does indeed contain sections requiring a Social Security number from those who ARE subject to an internal revenue tax, but the NON-TAXPAYER is without the scope of the revenue laws.Many people in the freedom movement have tried to obtain jobs without giving a Social Security number, only to have the employer quote a section from the Internal Revenue Code. This, of course, is not a valid reason in the case of a non-taxpayer because the revenue laws relate only to taxpayer(s) as defined. If an employer believes there is requirement for a non-taxpayer to furnish a Social Security number, the burden of proof rests with the employer - NOT the NON-TAXPAYER. The employer will have a difficult time here because the number can only be required from those subject to the tax (WHICH ALMOST NONE OF YOU REALLY ARE!!).Even if the employee provided a number to the employer, it still does not make the employee subject to the tax. The furnishing of a number does not change a non-taxable activity into a taxable activity. It's the nature of the activity that creates the liability.Let us look back to the now. After discussing Title VIII in the Helvering Case, the U.S. Supreme Court next discusses Title II of the act.It's now obvious, that none of the money collected from the so-called Social Security taxes goes directly into any special account. The only way money gets into the above-mentioned account is when Congress appropriates money from the general Treasury. When the public is told that the Social Security account is depleted, it's only because Congress has not appropriated sufficient funds from the Treasury to keep the account solvent.Money collected in so-called Social Security taxes goes into the general Treasury fund, and, no longer being identifiable, is spent along with the rest of the moneys collected. Pay attention to the arguments from the politicians regarding the status of the Social Security System and REALLY hear what it is they are quarreling about. If Congress chooses to appropriate funds for Social Security benefits, it can.However, if there is no claim that can be made upon the funds by the taxpayer(s) (as defined) who have paid the so-called Social Security taxes. The payment of taxes into the general Treasury is completely separable from Congress's choice in how and where public funds are to be spent.Congress may impose taxes on all legitimate subjects of taxation. If it's a direct tax, it shall be apportioned. If it is an indirect tax (duty, impost or excise), it shall be uniform. HOWEVER, and here is another one I bet you didn't think of, CONGRESS CAN LAWFULLY ONLY SPEND MONEY FOR PURPOSES AUTHORIZED BY THE U.S. CONSTITUTION!!!Providing the spending is deemed to be for the defense and/or the welfare of the nation, such spending is within the bounds of the Constitution. On the other hand, if the spending is deemed to be for the welfare of specific persons, as opposed to the general welfare of the nation, then the spending is not within the bounds of the Constitution, and therefore the spending is unconstitutional.If such spending of public funds for the so-called Social Security benefits is deemed to be for the general welfare of the nation, then such spending is within the bounds of the Constitution. The recipients are entitled to the benefits provided by congressional appropriations, regardless of the sources of revenue from which the general Treasury obtained the taxes.The tax paid into the Treasury is exactly that; . Moneys appropriated from the general Treasury and subsequently spent on general welfare is exactly that; The point being that it's actually frivolous for a person to say that because he paid so-called Social Security taxes, he has the right to Social Security benefits. The two are separable, which was one of the main purposes of the separability clause in the Social Security Act, at - 1103.Unfortunately, the common misunderstanding of Social Security by the American working men and women is of such magnitude that there will be many who will not believe what they have read here and will not want to believe it even if they go to a law library and get copies of the court cases cited. I KNOW this because this information has already been available since at least 1986. Further, for a much longer time it has been available in other formats which work from a different standpoint, but nonetheless do work. YOU ARE CONTROLLED BY LIES AND FEAR - NOT BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS OF YOUR LAND. There will, however, be Americans who are researching the court cases in an attempt to get to the bottom of the taxing problems and lies facing the American working men and women. Will it not be wondrous when the day of profound lies and enactment through force will be put behind us as a nation and people?Before appropriating any public funds, Congress is to judge if the spending is for the general welfare of the nation. As you read the various court cases, you will find that the courts will not interfere with Congress's judgment if by any reasonable possibility the spending is for general welfare.If providing Social Security checks every month to retired millionaires is deemed to be for the welfare of the nation, then such spending is indeed lawful and constitutional. If, on the other hand, such spending is deemed to be for the general welfare of the nation, then such spending is an unlawful and unconstitutional conversion of public funds, and, most surely constitutes criminal behavior. But then, didn't the millionaire probably contribute to that account? Can anyone in the possession of even a portion of their proper faculties honestly contend that this type of spending is ?It would appear, however, that the questions as to the constitutionality of the spending of public funds for the particular purposes are NOT being directly raised before Congress or the courts. When the fundamental principles of constitutional taxation and constitutional spending are better understood by the American working men and women, these issues will then, and only then, be properly raised by the citizens to Congress in addition to being raised profoundly in the courts.Great numbers of people want to do away with Social Security because they see that it is wrong, badly managed and the ones presently paying the costs will likely not have benefits later. Others, of course, want to keep the programs because of their well justified fear that many of the elderly and poor would not otherwise have any resources of funds with which to sustain themselves. Look carefully, though, for you can see from the Supreme Court cases, the taxing provisions are completely separate from the provisions for appropriating public funds for general welfare.Stated differently, Congress can lawfully appropriate funds for the general welfare of the nation if they so choose - and have done so constantly without your even taking note. It also can tax all lawful subjects of taxation - and you who are not subject to the taxation have somehow convinced yourselves to donate (voluntarily contribute) according to the rates provided plus penalties for not donating enough.Congress can even utilize its power to taxation, which it has not implemented in over 100 years, I suppose because all of you NON-TAXPAYERS keep donating and contributing so freely according to their needs and rates. I can find no other reason for sending your money and filling out forms, etc., for actually you do so most unlawfully when you are not even eligible as a taxpayer.While it's obvious that millions of working folks are having money withheld from their wages under the guise, pretext, sham and subterfuge of withholding so-called Social Security taxes, this unlawful, unconstitutional deprivation of property can come to an abrupt halt without jeopardizing the welfare of the truly needy. Congress will still have the power to obtain sufficient revenue from the lawful subjects of taxation and the needs of the nation can still be met quite constitutionally and you the people can keep total tabs on it.It's glaringly apparent that you must take action for all of the programs which are for general welfare, along with those where spending is done under the mere guise of general welfare, need to be fully reconsidered and the programs totally overhauled. However, the American people will not be able to give clear and meaningful instructions to their public servants in Congress until the American people themselves have an understanding of the constitutional principles of taxation and the constitutional principles which apply to the use of public funds.Much needs to be done to stop the illegal acts of those employers who are willfully, knowingly, corruptly and unlawfully withholding part of their employee' wages under the guise, pretext, sham and subterfuge of withholding taxes in the cases where the employee's job descriptions do not involve any revenue taxable activity (which is the category within which almost ALL of you belong).The employers must know that the revenue laws to those who are engaged in revenue taxable activities; i.e., unlawful, harmful and non-innocent. They must know that the withholding of ANY funds under the guise of taxation from those who are NON-TAXPAYERS and are not subject to the tax is totally and blatantly illegal. It's only because of lack of knowledge on the part of the working men and women that this CRIME continues on and on and on, unabated.We will point out another point of interest to these employers: THEY WILL FIND QUITE EMPHATICALLY THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WILL COME TO THEIR AID WHEN THEY ARE SUED BY THE DAMAGED NON-TAXPAYER EMPLOYEE; providing such nontaxpayer presents himself as a non-taxpayer as described in the , and not as a taxpayer as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.The internal revenue laws authorize the employers to withhold taxes from their employees whose job descriptions involve revenue taxable activities. The laws do not authorize the employers to violate an individual's constitutional rights or to commit FRAUD and Extortion against the employee who is merely exercising his natural, constitutionally-secured right to lawfully acquire property by lawfully contracting his own labor to engage in innocent and harmless activities for lawful compensation.THREE TYPES OF ID NUMBERS The Federal Government issues three types of identification numbers. These numbers all have nine digits. They are:THE STRUCTURE OF THE SSN The Social Security number is structured as follows:The following are the first three digit ranges assigned per state: 001-003...New Hampshire  004-007...Maine  008-009...Vermont  010-034...Massachusetts  035-039...Rhode Island  040-049...Connecticut  050-134...New York  135-158...New Jersey  159-211...Pennsylvania  212-220...Maryland  221-222...Delaware  223-231...Virginia & West Virginia  232-232...North Carolina  233-236...Not in use  237-246...North Carolina  247-251...South Carolina  252-260...Georgia  267-267...Florida  268-302...Ohio  303-317...Indiana  318-361...Illinois  362-386...Michigan  387-399...Wisconsin  400-407...Kentucky  408-415...Tennessee  416-424...Alabama  425-428...Mississippi  429-432...Arkansas  433-439...Louisiana  440-448...Oklahoma  449-467...Texas  468-477...Minnesota  478-485...Iowa  486-500...Missouri  501-502...North Dakota  503-504...South Dakota  505-508...Nebraska  509-515...Kansas  516-517...Montana  518-519...Idaho  520-520...Wyoming  521-524...Colorado  525-525...New Mexico  526-527...Arizona  528-529...Utah  530-530...Nevada  531-539...Washington  540-544...Oregon  545-573...California  574-574...Alaska  575-576...Hawaii  577-579...Washington, D.C.  580-584...Puerto Rico & Virgin lslands  585-585...New Mexico  586-586...Guam, Samoa & Pacific Territories  587-588...Mississippi  589-595...Florida  596-599...Not in use  600-601...Arizona  602-626...California  627-699...Not in use  700-728...Railroad Retirement  729-999...Not in useThe following range of first three digit's are currently NOT USED by the Social Security Administration: 233 through 236; 596 through 599; 627 through 699; 729 through 999.If you receive a Taxpayer Identification Number in the above number range, and you use it for establishing credit, it raises a RED FLAG ALERT at the Credit Bureau. If you get one, see if you qualify for a new Social Security Number by reviewing the section below on Changing Your Social Security Number.CHANGING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER The information that follows may be usefully applied to establish a new Credit File. Readers are advised to follow all laws and regulations to the letter.The Social Security Act (P.L. 74-271) was originated in 1935. It imposes taxes to finance a program of retirement and survivor benefits.However, one of the laws provision is not so well known or publicized. According to the department of Health Education and Welfare's publication, Records, Computers and the Rights of Citizens, the regulation provided that: Any employee may have his/her account number changed at any time by applying to the Social Security Board and showing good reason for a change. With that exception, only one account number will be assigned to an employee.The following is an example of one individual who used the above method to change his Social Security number. This individual, armed with the above information, requested that a new Social Security number be assigned. The manager at the SSN office had never heard of someone being assigned a new number; a new name, yes - but a new number, no. The individual explained that under the law one could have a SSN change if a good reason could be supplied. The good reason this person supplied was as follows:Because data banks are currently using SSNs as universal identifiers and because the SSN had been recorded by the police on the occasion of an arrest, the individual felt that the arrest record would end up in all those data files, causing embarrassment and economic hardship.Another plausible reason for requesting a new SSN would be reasonable suspicion that someone else had appropriated your name and number and is causing you embarrassment and economic hardship.You can come up with other plausible reasons. This method is available to you but it could take you up to 90 days to get your new Social Security number. Don't be afraid of the officer at the Social Security Office. All they can say is no. But if you are insistent, you may get a new Social Security Number. Then you can follow the steps on pages 20-21 to set up your NEW Credit File.Following is a copy of the Social Security Administration's procedures for securing a new Social Security number. These are the technical procedures that a Social Security Office must follow.HOW TO GET YOUR NEW TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE Recall that your Taxpayers Identification number is referred to as a TIN. Go to your local IRS office or call them at 1-800-829-FORM and request form SS-4. Don't volunteer why you want it. It's used for a number of reasons.NOTE: Before COMPLETING the SS-4, review the important strategies below. Before implementing these strategies, the reader should consult with an attorney to ensure that all laws and regulations are obeyed to the letter.Strategies for Completing the SS-4 The U.S. Constitution protects your right to live at any address or to use any address as your mailing address. In order to establish a new Credit File, you have three choices: (a) move to a new address; (b) use the address of a friend or relative; (c) use a mail receiving service.It's important when you apply for your new Taxpayer Identification Number, and you live in any of the following states:that you use an address on the SS-4 form of a friend, relative, or a mail receiving service, that is located in one of the areas specified below, so you can apply to the right IRS Service Center. The purpose of securing a Taxpayer Identification Number from one of the following IRS Centers is that the digits of the TIN number will be less than 62-6999999:If you live in a state other than those listed in the Alabama to Wyoming list, file your SS-4 with your current address, and with the IRS service center for your state where you currently file your tax return.If you have no legal residence, principal place of business, or principal office or agency in any Internal Revenue District, send to: IRS CENTER, Philadelphia, PA 19255.DO NOT SEND THE SS-4 FORM TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IRS CENTERS:The Credit Bureaus do audit the information it receives and it does look for items that are not valid and therefore raise a RED FLAG ALERT on the Credit Report.When you receive the SS-4 form (See sample form on pages 15-19) complete the following information:Don't forget to print and sign and date the form at the end.After completion of the SS-4, make a copy for your records. Mail the SS-4 to the appropriate IRS Center. You can get the correct mailing address from the SS-4 FORM.DO NOT call the number shown on the instructions to receive your new I.D. number directly from the IRS! Always use the U.S. MAIL to get the I.D. number. It will take from 3 to 4 weeks to receive your Taxpayers ID Number from the IRS.The TIN you receive will look something like this: 00-1234567. You will have to write the number as 00-1234567, which is required by section 6039(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. The TIN has the same number of digits as a Social Security number.When you apply for credit, enter your TIN where your Social Security number is requested. Indicate on the credit application that the number is a TIN number by putting TIN after the number. In this manner you are not lying on your credit application.Under the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the United States Code Annotated 552(a), It shall be unlawful... to deny any individual any right, benefit or privilege provided by law because of such individual s refusal to disclose his/her social security number.If you write your TIN number as 001-23-4567 or as 001234567, please review with your attorney before using it so you will not be in violation of any federal or state laws.IMPORTANT NOTICE: If you have ever applied before for a TIN number for banking purposes, the IRS will send back your original number to use. If you currently have a second TIN number for banking purposes, you may not be issued another number. Check your credit report to see if the TIN that was issued to you in the past is on your credit report. Check all credit bureaus to verify. If it's not on your credit report, you already have a taxpayer identification number you may be able to use.HOW THE MAJOR CREDIT BUREAUS IDENTIFY YOU Every credit bureau has a particular system of file retrieval that allows them to identify the file of each person in their system. It's necessary to identify each file in such a manner as to separate individuals with similar names and address so that Robert Jones will not appear on the file as Bob Jones. However, no bureau has yet come up with a perfect system of file identification. That's why you will sometimes see items on your report that belong to someone else with a similar name.In an effort to maintain maximum efficiency, credit bureaus prefer to set up more than one file per person rather than risk merging several people's files into one. This is the weak link in the system.In our research, the credit bureaus have two basic types of file identification. Type A is used by TRW, CBI/Equifax, and other major credit bureaus, with the exception of TransUnion. Type B is used mainly by TransUnion.File Identification System - Type A The following sequence of information is entered into the computer system in an attempt to match an existing file. If the information does not match, a new file is created.File Identification System - Type B This system is based entirely on the applicant's Social Security number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN), and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If it does not match the name, a new file will be created.HOW TO ESTABLISH A NEW CREDIT FILE After you've obtained your new TIN or SSN, you'll need to set up a new mailing address and phone number. In the case of setting up new credit, it's not advisable to use places like Mail Boxes Etc. as many credit bureaus maintain software which will detect these locations. Instead, use a local secretarial service or use a friend (in either case, don't open one in the same zip code that you currently use). I would also avoid the use of a Postal Service box rental for this purpose.Do not use any previously used or listed addresses on your new credit applications. Change the address on your driver's permit as well. Most states will allow you to use your TIN number instead of a SSN on your driver's permit. Unless you're also given a new driver's permit number with your new license, leave any question to this effect blank on a credit application.Make use of the voice mail box phone numbers for a new phone number.To create your new Credit File, use only the following where applicable:Armed with the above 'new data' begin to apply, by mail, for new department store credit cards and a new checking account at a new bank. Review carefully the applications so you do not provide any of your old credit data.More than likely, you'll be turned down the first few times you apply for new credit; don't be alarmed because YOU WILL BE CREATING A NEW FILE FOR YOURSELF. Next apply for a secured Visa card (a Visa card that is tied to a savings account on deposit at the granting institution - the biggest is Key Federal - addresses provided at the end of this section). Once you have this secured card (and no one will know it is secured) you can leverage this card into obtaining other credit. Most department stores, for instance, grant instant credit when you show a major credit card.Make sure, however, that you make a number of small purchases with your new credit card and pay the balance off promptly at the end of each billing cycle. This action will create a favorable payment history in your new Credit File. Within six to nine months of this, begin applying for other credit cards such as gasoline cards and so on. CAUTION: Do not go overboard during this time period in applying for too many new cards as these inquiries will show on your Credit File and will arouse suspicion. REMEMBER: Always apply by mail.Avoid merging your new credit with your old Credit File. Here are some simple items to avoid when establishing your new file:When starting this new process you may be asked why don't you have any credit? This is easily countered by saying you've been out of the country for several years, or that you were in the military, self-employed or had no previous desire for credit. Never volunteer information.The smaller the business and the smaller the line of credit you ask for in the beginning, the more your odds of success are improved.Just like most things in life, this information is valid IF IT IS NOT MEANT TO DEFRAUD ANYONE. If in doubt, check with a qualified attorney or accountant.THE COMMON LAW NAME PRINCIPLE You are free to use whatever name you like, as long as it's not used to defraud. You don't have to inform anyone of this fact, and you don't have to record it anywhere. You don't have to get your name officially changed. This is a common law principle. You are free to choose for yourself whatever name(s) you desire.However, if you put a common law name of your choice on a government form, and they find out, they'll regard it as a crime.HOW TO TERMINATE YOUR SSN by Anthony HargisPeople in the freedom movement have suspected that the SS number was a central issue, or an essential link, of the chain that bound everyone into a condition of slavery. Accordingly, everyone has tried dozens of methods to disconnect themselves from the SS number, except one, that I know of: going into the SS records and correcting the application for one's SS number.The application form for an SS number contains a section for the applicant to declare his citizenship. It includes such choices as U.S. Citizen, resident alien, foreign student and other. When you were ten or fifteen years old and coerced into applying for your SS number, what choice did you select? I would guess that, nine times out of nine, you chose U.S. Citizen. A deadly choice, especially when you consider what was said about the distinctions between state and U.S. citizenship in , 29 SCR 14.But assuming it to be true that the exemption from self-incrimination is not, as a fundamental right of national citizenship, included in the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, counsel insist that, as a right specifically granted or secured by the Federal Constitution, it is included in them. This view is based upon the contention which must now be examined, that the safeguards of personal rights which are enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the Federal Bill of Rights, ... are among the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States... It is, however, not profitable to examine the weighty arguments in its favor, for the question is no longer open in this court. The right of trial by jury in civil cases, guaranteed by the 7th amendment ( , 92 U.S. 90, 23 L.ed. 678), and the right to bear arms, guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment ( , 116 U.S. 252, 29 L. ed. 615, 6 Sup Ct. Rep. 580), have been distinctly held not to be privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment against abridgment by the states, and in effect the same decision was made in respect of the guarantee against prosecution, except by indictment of a grand jury, contained in the 5th Amendment ( , 110 U.S. 516, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292), and in respect of the right to be confronted with witnesses, contained in the 6th amendment ( , 194 U.S. 258, 48 L. ed. 965, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650). In , 176 U.S. 581, 591, 44 L. ed. 597, 601, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494 (sic, it should probably be 449), where the plaintiff in error had been convicted in a state court of a felony upon an information, and by a jury of eight persons, it was held that the indictment, made indispensable by the 5th Amendment, and the trial by jury, guaranteed by the 6th Amendment, were not privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, as those words were used in the 14th Amendment. The discussion in that case ought not to be repeated. All the arguments for the other view were considered and answered, and the decision rested upon the ground that this clause of the 14th Amendment did not forbid the states to abridge the personal rights enumerated in the first eight Amendments, because those rights were not within the meaning of the clause privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. ... We conclude, therefore, that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination is not a privilege or immunity of national citizenship guaranteed by this clause of the 14th Amendment against abridgment by the states.The essential point made by the court in the above citation was that the first eight Amendments, ... were not within the meaning of the clause privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. Since Amendments Nine and Ten have meaning only in the context of the first eight, the first Amendments are not available to citizens of the United States. The federal bill of rights, then, is available only to state citizens (sovereign individuals). Thus, if you declared yourself to be a U.S. citizen on your application for an SS number, you legally annihilated of your rights: those secured by the first eight Amendments and all those reserved in Amendments Nine and Ten.To correct this situation, it seems that we have to go into the SS records and correct your application for your number to reflect your true status. Once this is done, it should resolve most of the problems associated with work place, traffic, taxes, licenses and so forth. We have not yet perfected the procedure for doing so.We could experiment with one client and take six months or three years to develop the procedure and then offer the service to all others. In such a case, all others would remain in a condition of slavery for an additional six months or three years. Or, we could experiment with a large number of clients, make several mistakes and wrong turns and have the process substantially developed in less time. It is the nature of things that a goal is more quickly reached as more people pursue it.Accordingly, we are trying to recruit people who want to help us experiment with this project. Our fees will be calculated on a per letter or per response basis of two to six grams of gold each. If we need court action to compel the SSA to correct your records, that would be an extra expense. Please remember, this is an experiment at this stage: we do not know how long it will take nor what will be necessary to make it happen.The first step in this experiment is to obtain a copy of the form by which you applied for the number. You can do this on your own thru the SSA or, if you want our help regarding this step, send two grams of gold to us and we'll tell you how to complete this first step.- We the People ... and our Posterity, 17220 Newhope #201, Fountain Valley, California.

Facebook has unveiled new rules to stop their users from creatingposts related in any way to religion.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-planning-ban-religious-content-no/,False,Can not judge,Unrelated,False,Can not judge,Can not judge,,New Facebook Rules Show How Hard It Is to Police 1.4B Users,"Once upon a time, governing the Facebook community was relatively simple, because users—mostly American college students—shared at least some cultural context for what was and wasn’t acceptable. But now Facebook’s 1.39 billion users span a range of ages, ethnicities, religions, gender identities, and nationalities, and Facebook’s ability to create a space that meets everyone’s definition of “safe” increasingly has been called into question.Which is why today, Facebook updated its community guidelines, spelling out in unprecedented detail what constitutes unacceptable behavior. Yet the unwieldy specificity of the new guidelines only proves that Facebook’s policies and procedures surrounding user activity will never be a finished product. As the world's largest social network, Facebook certainly can learn a lot from the past, but it can never fully anticipate the future.It’s a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meets the needs of a diverse global community, Facebook executives wrote in a news release announcing the update. “For one thing, people from different backgrounds may have different ideas about what’s appropriate to share—a video posted as a joke by one person might be upsetting to someone else, but it may not violate our standards.”The new guidelines address everything from hate speech to nudity, making it clear that things like revenge porn, graphic images that glorify violence, and posts that threaten self harm or harm to others are explicitly prohibited. As always, anyone who violates these rules runs the risk of having their posts — or their accounts — blocked. According to the post, the updates to Facebook’s community guidelines aren’t so much tweaks to the guidelines, but fully formed explanations of how Facebook historically has assessed controversial content. For instance, though Facebook always has had a policy against nudity, the new guidelines get very specific about what type of nudity that rule refers to.“We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks,” the new policy reads. “We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.”This and other lines in the community guidelines reveal just how reactionary many of these rules are. Facebook’s anti-nudity policies have, in the past, provoked the ire of breast cancer survivors whose post-surgery photos repeatedly were removed. Banned photos of breastfeeding have been similarly controversial.These impassioned responses essentially have forced Facebook to add nuance to its blanket policies. Our policies can sometimes be more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate purposes, Facebook's updated nudity policy reads. We are always working to get better at evaluating this content and enforcing our standards.Facebook’s new guidelines also address last year's real name scandal, in which the company drew fire from the drag queen community for its policy requiring users to set up accounts with their real names. After two weeks of fighting, Facebook rethought its policy, with Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer writing a lengthy apology on Facebook. “We're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were,” he wrote.Now, Facebook says users are free to sign up with their authentic identities, or the names they go by on a daily basis. And yet, just as these rules are adjustments to past policies, they too, will likely be subject to adjustment down the line. The fact is, keeping social media safe for all users, with their many definitions of what that word means, is an unachievable task, and yet, Facebook is not alone in chasing it. Twitter has faced similar dissent from its community regarding the policing of harassment on the platform, leading CEO Dick Costolo to recently pledge to begin kicking trolls off of Twitter left and right, and making sure that when they issue their ridiculous attacks, nobody hears them.But for Facebook, Twitter, and indeed, all social networks, the central challenge of accomplishing this mission is that they cannot solve it the way they solve other problems, which is to say, with technology. Today, Facebook still relies on people to report a violation, and other people within Facebook to determine whether that piece of content truly does violate its guidelines. That's because no amount of expertly crafted algorithms can substitute for human sensitivity and judgment. But with billions of pieces of content being created every day from all corners of the globe, no amount of rules can adequately address every little judgment call these human moderators are forced to make. And so, the guidelines will always be a work in progress, forever begging to be rewritten.",https://www.wired.com/2015/03/facebook-guidelines/,

They’ve gotten so familiar to me that I often forget others aren’t, which is why I’ve compiled this extensive glossary of terms for SEO and social media marketing. My personal motto when speaking about online marketing is to “dumb it down without speaking to them like they’re dumb.” Hopefully I’ve succeeded in this with the below glossary. If I haven’t, feel free to contact me with any questions at (337) 233-1515 or rhess@nullbbrcreative.com.

Facebook has unveiled new rules to stop their users from creatingposts related in any way to religion.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-planning-ban-religious-content-no/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Trends | b-side,"Vietnam, remembered best by the Western world at once as the site of terrible wars and a pleasingly backward society with ‘the hidden charm’, is now one of the rapidly emerging economies of Asia. This significant change was notably brought about by the free market economic reformation in 1986 – known as Đổi Mới – allowed by the socialist government, the Vietnam Communist Party. As Vietnam’s economy develops, so do the attitudes and mindsets of the people. When global influences enter the country and commercialism takes a foothold, the population becomes more urbanised, leading to increased use of digital devices and the Internet. Though Vietnam still digitally lags behind other Asian countries – the Internet only available from 1997 [1] – the convenience of modern technology has led to rapid adoption in the local market, opening up opportunities for companies to reach consumers via the World Wide Web.Vietnam has 26.8 million internet users within a population of 86.5 million by the end of 2010. It has an estimated online penetration of 31%, and can be seen as one of the emerging markets in Asia. In the Vietnam NetCitizens Study 2011 conducted by Cimigo, nearly 56% of its urban population area are already connected to the internet, with Hanoi leading at 64% internet penetration rate.[3].Remarkably, this puts Vietnam in an unique position as it has become one of the fastest growing internet country in the region and in the world. In terms of internet growth rate, Vietnam has has topped the Asia Pacific region with a staggering 12,035% growth over the past 10 years from 2000-2010. This is followed by second-placed China with a growth rate of 1767% and India with 1520% [4] DemographicsInternet users in Vietnam are significantly younger than the internet users from many other countries in this region. 38% of the internet users aged from 15-24 years old forming the predominant group of internet users in Vietnam followed by 33% of them from the age group of 25-34 years old. Also it is said that 95% of the 15-24 years old population in Vietnam are already connected to the internet, hinting a bright prospects of the future digital media usage in Vietnam. [6].The usage frequency of the internet is very high in Vietnam. Nearly 90% of internet users access the internet more than once a week, and about 60% use it daily. Only a small minority of internet users (8%) use the internet less than once a week. [8].As for length, the Vietnamese spend more time online than most of their Asian peers, averaging 23.2 hours per month as at end of 2010. The average Vietnamese would spend an average of 2 hours and 20 minutes online during the weekdays, and slightly less during the weekends. This is especially prevalent in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City where nearly 50% of the population spends an average of more than 2hours online per day. [9] Places of Online AccessVietnamese users are online most frequently at home (78%), followed by at work (31%) and at an internet shop or cyber café (26%). In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, access from home is more common than in other cities, while internet cafes are more frequently visited by young age groups and lower socio-economic classes.[10]As of end 2010, Vietnam has more than 3.6 million fixed broadband subscribers, and this represented a strong leap of 200% from the number of subscribers in 2007. [11]. Although the fixed broadband penetration rate remained relatively low at about 6% of the population, it is estimated to increase to 16% by 2015. [12]. This may signify potential strong growth in the number of internet users for the coming years. Quality of internet usage would also improve greatly for the coming years as the Ministry of Information and Communication has already started to look into the development of 4G. [13]The list on the left shows the ranking of various internet activities that Vietnamese engaged in. The Vietnamese use the internet mainly for information gathering so much so that Vietnamese internet users average about 30million searches per day. [15] It is interesting to note that internet users in Vietnam are perhaps more inclined towards being a spectator than a creator as 46% of them visit forums but only 18% of them post onto the forum. Likewise, 31% of the internet users visit blogs but only 20% of them write a blog. Users from the younger age group (15-24 years old) are more active than all other age groups for all the activities except Use for News, Email, Shopping/Auctions and E-banking. [16].The Vietnam telecommunications in general and its mobile market is one of the most dynamic markets in the region. The mobile market has experienced an strong growth of 39.8% from 2009 to 2010, whereby the number of mobile phone suscribers have increased up to 154 million. [17]. Amongst all the internet users, nearly 40% of them have already accessed the internet via their mobile phone or smart phone. [18]. The mobile penetration rate currently stands at 120%[19] and it is expected to pass the 200% mark in 2011, with a subscriber base of 184.49 million people. [20].Vietnam’s mobile market has been experiencing double digit growths due to the marketing efforts of the country’s mobile operators. Its largest three operators are: Mobifone, Viettel and Vinafone, and their market share totals over two thirds of the market. Vietnam is also in the midst of developing its 3G infrastructure as the popularity for smartphones has been rapidly increasing in the country. Six months after 3G services was first introduced into the market in 2009, only 3% of the mobile users signed up for the services. However, subscription rate jump up to 11% of mobile users another six months following that. It is also estimated that the number of 3G users would increase from approximately 8million in 2011 to 16million by 2014. This is in view that 98% of Vietnam would have 3G coverage by end 2012.[21].To understand the usage of digital media platforms and the behavior of Vietnamese people online, we must bear in mind that majority of the internet users are very young, as compared to internet users in other countries. Consequently, the activities they pursue online are reflective of their demographic, interests and activities they pursue offline as well. According to the Vietnam NetCitizens Report 2011 by Cimigo [22], these activities are grouped into 5 categories:1. Information Gathering 2. Online Entertainment 3. Online Communication 4. Blogging and Social Networks 5. Online Business Due to the late start in internet penetration in Vietnam, there is still a way to go for social media to be fully embraced by its Netizens. However, this also indicates a tremendous amount of potential and opportunities that businesses and individuals can tap into.Hence, given the remarkable internet growth rate in Vietnam, social media will continue to significantly expand and provide great prospects for the online industry. However, it is also important to note that instead of using the more common social media tools like Facbook and Twitter, Vietnam has its own localized version of social media tools which could be a significant threat to its international counterparts. More importantly, this would mean that it would be more difficult for marketers to decide on the right digital channel to market their products in Vietnam as compared to marketing their products in other countries. Vietnam Social Media Landscape by Ogilvy 360Blogging in Vietnam has grown alongside the growth of internet usage in Vietnam. Writing and visiting blogs constitutes an important part of the internet lives of the Vietnamese, and takes up a substantial part of their internet usage. Nearly half of internet users have already visited blogs, forums and social networks, and blogs and forums are mostly visited on a weekly basis. However, like in many countries, the average user takes a more passive role in blogging, whereby out of the 30% of internet users who visit blogs, only 20% have a blog of their own. Hence, blogs can be seen as a source of information for web browsers in Vietnam as well. [25] Blogging is an activity usually associated with the youth in Vietnam. They actively visit and contribute to blogs, forums and social networks – their usage rate is 50% higher than that of older age groups. They contribute three times as often in blogs and forums compared to older users, and most of its contents are reflections of their daily lives, events, gossip and personal thoughts. Differences in gender have also led to differences in blog usage in Vietnam. Females are more often visiting and writing blogs, while visiting and posting in forums is more popular with males. [26]The most popular blogging platform until 2009 was Yahoo! 360∘, where users could create blogs, personal websites, share photos from Yahoo! Photos, create and share a public profile and see which friends are currently online. At that time, there were more than 2 million Vietnamese who were Yahoo! 360∘users, and its usage topped that of Youtube, Myspace, Facebook etc. However, Yahoo announced the closure of the Yahoo! 360∘website on 13 July 2009, and this made a big impact in the Vietnam blogosphere. [27]After the closure of Yahoo! 360∘, most bloggers migrated to platforms such as WordPress, Zing, YuMe, Clip.vn, Vietspace and even Facebook. While Yahoo reintroduced a new platform, Yahoo! 360∘Plus, it never picked up on where its predecessor left off, and could not reclaim its dominance online. Although it remained as the most important website for blogging, the penetration rate has decreased from 53% to 41%. At the same time, Facebook is catching up with Yahoo! 360∘Plus at 35% and with the addition of a new local blogging website Blog360.vn, it could possibly affect the position of Yahoo! 360∘Plus. [29] A significant result of Yahoo! 360∘closure was the decline of blogging in Vietnam in 2009. From 2007, there was a attributable decrease in the writing of blogs from 27% to 20%. [30] Another reason for the decline of blogging in Vietnam could be the government’s crackdown on politically active blogs which threaten to undermine and discredit the government. In 2008, Hanoi passed a new law prohibiting bloggers from creating posts the government claim incite violence or crime, undermine national security, including inaccurate information that could damage the reputation of individuals and organizations, or disclosure of state secrets. [31] The implementation of this law led to the arrests of a few high profile Vietnamese bloggers due to their political and controversial blog posts. As such, these events led to a decline in blogging and stagnation in growth of the blogosphere in Vietnam. This has given rise to more popular online activities, such as social networking, forums and online gaming. Blogging TrendsAside from the myriad of personal blogs online, a new league of bloggers are gaining increased attention and have turned blogging into a career in their status as a “hot blogger”. These blogs attract thousands of hits a day, and have turned their owners into overnight stars who dictate greatly the trends and entertainment news of the country.Blogger Gao, who rose to fame after blogging about her thoughts about life, family and love, as well as short stories which captured the interest of many Vietnamese netizens. Her rise to fame allowed her to publish some of these short stories in a bestseller book, and she is now a PR manager of Vietnam Artist Agency of famous actress Ngo Thanh Van.[32] Her Facebook fanpage shows that she has over 180,000 fans as of October 2011, and the number keeps growing as she continues to post entries on her blog.As a result of the rise in “hot bloggers” in Vietnam, businesses have started to reach out to these bloggers because of their strong fan following, high volume of site visits and high readership. As a result, they become brand ambassadors or endorsers of new products introduced by these businesses, and are paid to write and promote the brand on their blogs.Blogger Robbey McNificent became popular after he began posting reviews of music albums and blogging about the Vietnam Idol competition. His blog has since garnered over 4 million views, and he now even hosts shows with other celebrities for media events in Vietnam. His readers are mostly young adults, with 61% of them coming from the age of 18 to 24 years old.[33] A part of his job now is to introduce new products that he likes and uses to his readers so to promote the brand and image of the businesses behind it. This has proven to be very beneficial to his sponsors, especially for products catered to the youth, as information about their products spread widely and rapidly to their target audience.Forecast Due to the advent and popularity of social networking and online gaming sites, blogging is slowly losing its precedence in Vietnamese Internet usage, especially as many web users continue to take a passive stance in this activity. However, for bloggers who continue to post interesting and unique content on their blogs, their commitment and creativity do get acknowledged in terms of readership and following. Hence, the trend of “hot bloggers” and accordingly, advertising in blogs, will likely continue in the coming years – as long as the audience remains interested instead of turning to other avenues for information and entertainment.Current Microblogging in Vietnam is still a relatively new concept, as opposed to blogging, visiting forums and social networking online. Vietnamese people are still more familiar with the concept of updating their profile status, like on social networking platforms such as ZingMe, rather than uploading small elements of content on Microblogging platforms such as Twitter. As described by blogger Van Nguyen, the “Vietnamese mind concept is not to be an individual but to always try to fit in a group or community”. This is translated to their online behavior as “we love to play games, having fun in a certain community more than quoting in 140 max characters.” [34]Although there has been no statistics on the penetration rate and the number of twitter users in Vietnam, it does not mean that the community is not growing. The top Microblogger in Vietnam Mr. Giải Pháp Số, tweets about technology and social media related news and currently has more than 53,000 followers under his Twitter account @giaiphapso. Microblogger Ben Chua, has a following of more than 6000 people on Twitter under the account @TwitVietnam. People follow his Twitter for local news in Vietnam, as well as to connect with each other, as seen by their Tweet-ups that have taken place over the past few years.Twitter “clones” have also been developed in Vietnam to suit the local consumer’s Internet usage preferences. For example, US-based software company VietTech Corporation has launched a beta version of a social networking and Microblogging site, PingGadget.com. PingGadget allows users to communicate with one another, stay connected to what is going on around them, and build custom groups specific to their location and interests. It features jobs, classifieds, events, nightlife, music and volunteering opportunities at various locations as well. It also has image and video uploading capacities, but it does not provide a platform to support blogs. [36] Other Twitter “clones” include Linkhay, Mimo and Ola Me.According to blogger TaiTran, there are ways to bring Twitter, or Twitter clones into the Vietnam market. In his visual step-by-step guide[37] , Tai highlights that developers can learn lessons from the use of Yahoo!360 Blast, and apply them to their own sites. It is important to educate Vietnamese netizens of what microblogging is, before they can associate it as a concept different from online social networking, and start adopting it in their online routine. Future developers should also customize their services to the local market in, and incorporate familiar features in their sites, so that there can be an easier transition from the idea of profile updates to microblogging. For example, services such as instant messaging and profile pages can be included in their sites, so that people can access and communicate with people using more functions at the same place. As such, while the trend of microblogging has yet to be picked up fully in Vietnam, there is a growing potential in users here if people become more aware and educated about its concept and use. At the same time they are should also be allowed to conduct their usual online activities on this platform, so that it makes adopting the service into their online lifestyle easier.Involvement Although Vietnam has shown the highest growth in reach of 35% from 2009 to 2010, the penetration rate of social network remains low at just 66%. This has also led to a 73% increased in the number of Vietnamese sharing photos on social networking sites in the same years as they began to embrace the sharing of photos with friends as part of the social networking experience.[39]] In addition, the social networking scene in Vietnam is primarily occupied by the younger generation, who are both more familiar with the Internet and open to new web developments – most local social networking users are from 15 to 29 years old.[40] Overall, 72% of the population between 18 to 30 and 43% of older population use social networking to interact with friends and family.[41] Though Vietnamese mobile use is far lower than computer use, 48% of the population access social networking via computers, while 33% access it via mobile.[42]The top three social networking platforms in Vietnam as of 2011 are the international Facebook, Vietnamese ZingMe, and Go.vn. The three service sites are evaluated below:Forecast According to Mr Bui Quang Minh (VCCorp), the social networking landscape in Vietnam in 2011 will be the battle between Facebook, ZingMe and a few potential players like Go.vn, Kunkun.[56]However, according to Google Double Click Ad Planner, there were 340 million visits to Facebook in January 2011, a 70% decrease compared to December 2010.[57] This may be due to the fact that government’s banned on Facebook has caused it to be inaccessible 70% of the time. Although the data above has shown that ZingMe is the most popular social network in Vietnam, there are other research which places Facebook firmly at the top with apparently 70% of those social network users using Facebook. However, it remain ambiguous as to how active these users are on Facebook.[58]]But considering Facebook’s recent move to hire Mr. Huynh Kim Tuoc (former Google advisor for Vietnam market) as Growth Manager for Vietnam market (Jan 2011),[60][61] the tables may be turned in its favor again. Furthermore, FPT Vietnam’s telecom giant recent partnership with Facebook in April 2011 may indicate a positive direction for Facebook to be unblocked in the near future. The partnership allows FPT to help promote and sell ads for Facebook with the possibility of even developing a Facebook application for the Vietnam market. [62] This would mean that more companies would seek to gain an online presence as well as connect to their customers via Facebook as even without an easy access to Facebook, Vietnamese companies have already started to use it as a marketing tool.[63].Other trends will include the blossoming of social applications, especially game – related applications. The list provided Other services on social networks will be an advantage for Vietnamese platforms that have already had online payment channels likeZingXu (VNG – ZingMe) and vCoint(VTC- Go.vn)Snapshot Forums were first created in Vietnam in the early 1990s. Forum participants are mostly from a very young group (15-29 years old).[64] In fact, 20% of online users go to forums.[65]The oldest and biggest community is TTVNOL which dates back to 1990s. Some of the biggest communities are TTVNOL, Dienanh.net, DDTH, 5giay, Webtretho, truongton, Yeuamnhac.Other noticeable issues about forum community in 2009-2010 include various reports of flaming. Prominent cases include the scandal surrounding Mrs. Vietnam Contest. One of the contestant claimed that there had been numerous degrading forum posts about her on Webtretho. The situation received wide press coverage, and relevant authority was notified. However, no legal outcome was ruled on the contestant’s behalf. In 2009, two members of TTVNOL forums were fined for flaming VNDirect, a stock company, in the stocks discussion board of TTVNOL and the OTC Stocks forum. One of them was identified as being from a competitor company.[66] Thus, forums have many implications for both the corporate community and general society in Vietnam.Corporate Utilization Corporations have paid more attention to what is being said about them on community forums as word of mouth generation from forum discussions is huge. For Webtretho, the most popular brand comparison discussions are for milk and diary products, international schools and cosmetics, while it’s IT products on DDTH and other IT forums, and movies on Dienanh.net. The shift from white-collared experts to user experts can be seen clearly. Opinion leaders are sought after because what they write matter to the community and thus, their influence may spill over offline and affect consumers’ purchase decisions. Many corporations have latched onto this trend and work in closer collaboration with forum moderators. For example, Dienanh.net, a popular movie forum, has a section for promoting Lotte Cinema, a movie theater chain. Webtretho has a roundtable section sponsored by brands like P/S (Unilever) and Dutch Lady with regular contests, deals, and product counseling for the community members. Some websites have organized offline events sponsored by firms in their respective fields – for example, Dienanh.net members regularly receive coupons and invitations to movie screenings.Implications and Forecast With the rise of social networking sites, will forums take a step back? A forum’s biggest drawback is lack of real time updates – a question posed on forums may not get replies as fast as when it is posted on social networking sites. However, forums are still an important part of online community and activity in Vietnam, due to its information sharing on common interests across wider audiences, and easy translation to offline relationships, which we don’t see happening on Facebook pages community yet. Back to top ↑Communication is one of the main online activities that Vietnamese people conduct on the internet. The main types of communicating online in Vietnam are through chatting, emailing, and sending SMSes online. Instant messaging as become so popular as a chatting platform that it has nearly 72% reach in Vietnam, way above the global average of 35%.[67]Currently, Yahoo! Messenger is the most popular Instant Messaging service in Vietnam. Yahoo! Messenger has 17 million users in Vietnam. Yahoo! plans to increase the usage of its Messenger service by partnering with Vietnam’s largest telecom operator, Viettel, and mobile social networking company Miyowa, by bringing Yahoo! Messenger to mobile phone users in Vietnam. This way, mobile phone users with a 3G network can now choose to communicate with each other through Instant Messaging on their phones, thus saving costs on texting and calls. [68]Currently, YouTube, Clip.vn and Dailymotion are the most popular video-sharing sites in Vietnam and are ranked 2nd, 9th, and 10th respectively on Vietnam’s Top Entertainment Sites.[69]. Clip.Vn, the localized version of Youtube still pale in comparison with its international counterpart. The popularity of Youtube stems from its faster speed, greater navigation and usability, a reasonable amount of advertising and a large online community which leads to a significantly large database of user-generated content.[70]At the moment, Google is the most popular search engine in Vietnam with nearly 90% of internet users use it as their preferred search site and 50% of them use it for school or work research. However, Vnexpress.net top the search engines for news as Vietnamese still prefer to read from localized news portals. [72]For a search engine catered to local sites, VietGATE is the host to the VietSearch engine, one of the most powerful search engines used to find Vietnamese content sites all over the web. It has links to over 100,000 Vietnamese pages in its database, making it a gateway to the online Vietnamese community.As of 2010, Vietnam has 156.1 million phone subscribers, 90.32% of which are mobile phones. Vietnam has also been listed among the markets with the highest growth rates in the world.[73]The mobile phone application market is considered to be a “gold mine” as Vietnam is trying to develop 3G technology, and as the number of people using smartphones rapidly increase. One of the popular mobile applications available in the Vietnam market is TWO.VN, a location-based mobile application service similar to Foursquare.[74] Targeting young, urban and savvy users, Two.vn has close to 170,000 users. On top of simply checking in and communicating your whereabouts or recommending location tips, it is linked with the most popular local music site and local music TV channel, Yan TV, and also provides news, updates and maps to create a combined lifestyle package.This market has a great potential to grow as the 3G technology has yet to be fully exploited. There is a great opportunity for local businesses in Vietnam, as well as foreign companies with more experience in developing mobile applications, to develop the service here and allow the market to grow.Online shopping is fast growing popularity in Vietnam. With an expanding economy and a large demographic of computer-savvy youngsters keen on displaying their newfound wealth, local businesses and retail firms around the globe have been vying for a share of this emerging market.One of the top three online shopping sites is 123mua.com.vn (123-buy).[75] It has over 15,000 e-stores on its site, with each store selling more than 100 different types of products. So far, most of these sites are Vietnamese-language only. But after foreign ownership restrictions on the retail market were lifted earlier this year, the virtual marketplace is expected to diversify.[76]This has led to foreign companies such as eBay, Yahoo and Google, to enter the Vietnam market and try to tap into the local customer base. Alibaba.com, which claims to be the world’s online business to business marketplace, has also teamed up with Vinalink to expand into the Vietnamese market. This is a good indication that online shopping in Vietnam will continue to grow, and provide additional avenues for brands to interact and sell to their customers.In order to understand the importance and effects of digital media arising in Vietnam, we should look back to the country’s traditional media and analyse them. In all fields, traditional media in Vietnam is monitored and governed by the state. TelevisionAll Vietnamese families now own television sets, and 86% of families own DVD/VCD/VCR players. The television is the most dominant device in terms of usage. [77]The major TV station is Vietnam Television, the only nation-wide network in Vietnam. It has five channels: news and current affairs, science, technology and education, sports, and entertainment. Since 1991, Vietnamese public places are permitted under license to install and operate satellite dises. Satellite networks from other countries like Hong Kong’s Star TV, and Thailand’s UBC can also be seen in Vietnam.[78]In 2001, two new home-grown multi-channel cable TV networks were launched – Vietnam Cable Television (Hãng Truyền hình Cáp Việt Nam, VCTV) in Hanoi and Saigon Tourist Cable Television (Hãng Truyền hình Cáp Saigon Tourist, SCTV) in Ho Chi Minh City. Both offer an international bouquet ranging from CNN, BBC World, TV5, ESPN and Discovery Channel to MTV Asia, Star Movies, Star World, HBO, Cinemax, Cartoon Network and TCM. In 2008, two southern television stations – Ho Chi Minh City Television Station (HTV) and Bình Dương Radio and Television Station – were experimenting with digital broadcast technology. RadioOwnership of radio is decreasing: in 2006, 63% of the population owned radios, which decreased to 34% in 2008. [79]There are 3 radio stations and 60 other radio channels that belong to TV stations. In Vietnam, where radio listeners are mainly students, FM channels are most preferred. Radio programmes in general are government controlled and information oriented, with very low consumer-interest. However, exposure is strong in rural areas such as the Mekong Delta, where people have little access to media of higher cost and technology. The forerunner of today’s national radio station Voice of Vietnam (Đại tiếng nói Việt Nam, VOV) was established in Hanoi just a week after the Declaration of Independence. In 2004 it was reported that VOV’s programmes had reached more than 90 per cent of all households throughout the country. Print PublicationsCoupled with the adoption of the Vietnam national official language: quốc ngữ , the rapid growth of publishing from the late 19th century onwards contributed to the rapid spread of literacy in Vietnam.To look back to the Vietnam publishing sector, the milestone was reached in 1952, when President Hồ Chí Minh signed Order 122/SL which established a National Printing House (Nhà In quốc gia) with responsibility for the state management of the three industries of publishing, printing and book distribution.Then, due to the effect of Reunification in 1975, the industry in North Vietnam got the assistance from the Soviet Union, China and some East European countries. Publishing, printing, and distribution staff were sent overseas for training. The other impact of the west came out in the 1990s. The open door policy makes the publishing officials to study contemporary printing technology in the west.[80]Today, there are 18000 new book titles each year by the country’s 47 publishing houses, and 700 newspapers and periodicals published by around 450 press organizations.In 2009, 60% of the 88 million populace were under 30[81] with an ever-increasing number of web-savvy working adults with a positive economical outlook. Each younger generation of Vietnamese become more intimate with the Internet, thus creating a sustainable customer base for companies to market to on the Internet.As such, the rate of Vietnamese embracing technology has increased emphasis on digital marketing, especially since traditional media, like papers and magazines, are heavily monitored by the government. [82] The populace are also used to advertisements in traditional media, and companies have to search for more novel ways to reach their customers – an aim more achievable digitally – and there is “increasing demand for creative, nontraditional touch points”. [83]ZingMe look likely to win in the social networking market, but despite Facebook’s uncertain status and its reducing market share in recent months, marketing services related to this platform are still developing. Price per click for advertisement (CPC) on Facebook is at 0.25USD, nearly doubling its 0.13USD late 2010. Price for 1000 impressions (CPM) ads placed in Facebook has reached 0.12USD, doubling this rate 3 months ago. Ads on Facebook flourish, suggesting investors are increasingly interested in forms of online advertising on this social network. Marketing to fans for brand promotion is not cooling off any time soon. [84] According to Mr.Cuong (CEO of Click Media), “Facebook is still the most effective despite its being blocked, both in term of interaction and conversion rate”. Compared to Facebook, ZingMe is judged as being limited in commercial use due to its heavy focus on games. [85]As consumers gain access to overall aggregations of opinion online and start treating advertisements and paid endorsements with some cynicism, businesses are under more pressure than ever to maintain their corporate reputation and be aware of forum opinions. Given the public, open nature of forums, not only are the members of the forums influencing and being influenced by each other across the country, so are non-members who search for information on the Internet. Though social networking sites are rising in prominance, forums’ environment of networks – mostly amongst already established relationships of friends and family, and rarely distant peoples connected by common interest – is still a crucial vehicle of public opinion.The Vietnamese web populace heavily use search sites, with a reported 91% using search engines.[86] Google’s dominance is especially important knowledge for companies, since the company – unlike its counterparts – asserts that all search results listings are organic. Google’s paid customers benefit from Google ads and advice on search engine optimisation to appear early in relevant searches.[87] Evidently, search engine optimisation (SEO) is increasingly important for companies appealing to the Vietnamese, and Vietnamese webcompanies are already offering SEO services along with webpage design.Vietnamese society, even with its shifting, Westernised youth, is generally classified as collectivistic – especially due to prominant Buddhist and Confuciust influence[88] – with feminine characteristics like relationship-focused and nurturing, with a relatively high power distance.[89] These aspects have been seen in how the Vietnamese approach the web and build their online presence, valuing large-community building and expressing a reverence for figures they deem a presentable and superior source of information and opinion, such as hot bloggers. The use of anonymity in online life also reflects societal worries – whether it be possible detection by the state regarding taboo issues like politics, or whether higher authorities, whether their bosses, parents or teachers. In essence, Vietnam’s society structure has partially transposed onto the Internet, though the older generation are less prominent than they are in real life.The Internet in turn impacts Vietnam by giving the population vehicles of communication, to strengthen the ties between geographically separate – to a certain extent, as digital penetration is much higher in urbanised areas – peoples and connect them via common interests. The greater feeling off community leads to the incredible impact of advertising, as seen in the case studies below. However, the web also presents opportunities for communications between those with political interests, resulting in the power struggle over opinion and information between the government and political dissidents. Just as the Internet has done worldwide, Vietnamese society is now increasingly empowered to spread information and connect.The state had maintained control over information access via traditional media, but has found it increasingly difficult to moderate content over digital channels. Undesirable content on Vietnamese Internet consists of pornography and content in Government Decree No. 97: anything that “opposes the state …undermines national security, social order or safety, causes conflict or discloses national security, military or economic secrets.” [90]Most filtered websites seem to be political dissidance and religious freedom content in Vietnamese. Perhaps due to lower foreign language literacy in Vietnam, such websites in other languages like English and French are not as thoroughly blocked as the aforementioned content. [91] Otherwise, commercial content is generally unaffected, except in the cases where certain web-communication channels are closed off due to its propensity to connect insurgents. Please see Controversies – Government Online Monitoring & Involvement.Ever since the implementation of the Internet during 1997, Vietnam has been vascillating between a lofty vision of significant digital and technological development and a general lack of willingness, ability and resources to achieve such a goal. The potential is great – the economy is growing, Vietnam suffers from no lack of independent entrepreneurs hawking their specialised goods, and the population is massive. However, e-commerce is simply not on the radar of Vietnamese businesses.[92] It is possible the prevalence of Internet cafes over computers at home, an urban-rural divide in connectivity, a young and weaker IT industry, low online security as well as a nebulous set of regulations in a channel that the government similarly is unsure about has caused e-commerce to be seen as unviable by companies. It was anticipated in 2006 that the passing of regulations such as the Law on Electronic Transactions[93] would lead to a higher willingness to participate in e-commerce. Unfortunately, Vietnam’s e-commerce segment is still struggling: the government’s Overall Plan on Developing E-commerce has been raised at various points, from 2001-2005[94], 2006-2010[95][96] and 2011-2015 [97], all with similar goals of developing IT infrastructure, e-commerce regulations and laws and increased security of transactions. Though the state has evidently been continously attempting to improve e-commerce, it is still not seen as a substantial business force in Vietnam, with companies calling for more improvements. [98][99]Vietnam’s economic development in the digital sector, though currently not at its full potential, may yet grow bigger faster in the new decade – the country’s digital content industry – consisting of IT and telecommunications – turnover reached USD1 billion in 2010, possibly indicating that the necessary quality infrastructure for e-commerce will be established soon.[100]Increased use of digital media is a cause for worry in regards to energy consumption and electronic waste (e-waste).[101] As Vietnam’s society develops, digital media and electronic gadgets become more prevalent, and increasing affluence often leads to higher consumerism and goods turnover. E-waste and energy consumption, in light of the large Vietnamese population, is a danger already manifesting: higher living standards, decreasing cost and technological development speed, according to Tran Quang Hung, General Secretary of the Vietnam Electronic Industries Association, have caused the population to replace their appliances faster, resulting in a far higher level of e-waste being generated than before. Electronics also contain toxic material such as lead and mercury, which leads to pollution as they are thrown away. [102] As the economy developed, the state passed the Law on Environmental Protection in 2005 which held not only corporations, but households and individuals responsible for their wastage and environmental pollution as well. [103] However, the problems of e-wastage, stemming from the root problems of an emerging economy, still loom large – a recent attempt by a US company to export e-waste from America to Vietnam highlights a continuing need for attention in this aspect.[104]Vietnam’s digital regulations have mostly been established after the fact, since the nation is inexperienced with the Web, of which activity can be unpredictable. As the government takes active interest in Vietnam’s digital access and media, regulations have been mentioned in various sections of the page.Internet Content – Government Decree No. 97, same as 2008 Law on Inciting violence or crime, undermining national security, reputation-damage and state secrets. IXP and ISP Law regarding Internet access. E-Commerce Plans from 2001 to 2011 Law on Environmetal Protection, including e-waste, in 2005 Recording Industry Association of Vietnam (RIAV), in 2003Many Vietnamese music-sharing sites operate as search and link collectors for licensed music tracks uploaded on the Web privately, instead of paid-for streaming and downloads like their Western counterparts Lastfm and the iTunes store. Only a minority of sites, for example Zing.vn, pay royalties to music artistes.In 1999, part of Vietnam’s trade agreements with the US is legislation on the eradication of Vietnamese-US music piracy: American companies and individuals were allowed to take action against copyright abuse in Vietnamese courts, and the upholding of such rights were left to Vietnam’s Ministry of Culture and Information. [105]Yet still, piracy still evidently exists and its state has exacerbated by the advent of the Internet, even if shops selling hordes of copies CDs are shut down.The issue of piracy in a burgeoning economy like Vietnam’s may stem from the fact that popular music and Westernisation are greatly desired, but the population at large are unable to buy imported CDs at the prices mandated by the industry.[106] With easy alternatives on the web, and the perennial problem of wanting to acquire simply one track, the Vietnamese are then more inclined to download a desired track illegally. As the youth are most familiar with the Internet, it is no surprise that youths download illegal music most.The Ministry of Internal Affairs established the Recording Industry Association of Vietnam (RIAV) in 2003 to address piracy and other music-related legal issues in Vietnam. Other than providing information and advice in legal affairs and to the people, RIAV also set up a membership system, pledging to protect the rights of those who voluntarily join the Association while acquiring advice and support from members.[107] RIAV actions since include appealing to the government for simplified licensing procedures[108], and attempts to sue companies operating in Vietnam allowing consumers infringe copyright.[109]Internet access, like most key aspects of the country, is subject to the scrunity of the government. Vietnamese web access is through Internet Exchange Points (IXP) which are under the control of the state, and all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) mandatorily connect to the Internet via IXP. [110] [111]Governing Vietnamese Internet access and use is Government Decree No. 97: anything that “opposes the state …undermines national security, social order or safety, causes conflict or discloses national security, military or economic secrets.” [112] Such a definition allows to varying reasons for content control. The history of insurgents using innocuous Internet communication networks, such as chatrooms and emails, has resulted in the state being wary of Vietnamese political comments and content online, and the social web vehicles that can be used to connect dissenters and distribute their opinion. It is widely assumed that the state is responsible for Facebook’s inaccessibility, which if true, reflects the VCP’s concerns about possible uses of convenient, widespread social networking. [113] The state also attempts to involve themselves in the population’s Internet use, as seen above in the creation of the government-owned social networking site, Go.vn. The Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC), connected to the Ministry of Information and Communication, also allocates national “.vn” domain names and addresses.[114]1. More active participation on digital media as broadband and mobile penetration is set to increased.2. Majority of the active participants come from the Young generation (15-24 years old).3. Vietnamese youths are excited and open to branding and entertainment content and are adaptive to new trends.4. Vietnamese clones are forces to be reckoned with. Would Facebook be unblock? Should the company go local or global?5. Electronic Commerce is set to rise but would face challenges with security issues.2. Pay attention to forums. If your audience is discussing about your products there, you’d better be engaged and answering their enquiries.3. Understand how the localized social media clones work before deciding which social media platform to use.4. Ease of usage and accessibility of the campaign is crucial in attracting users at the start.5.

Using her blog, Uselessmarketing.com, Binh showcases the state of digital marketing in Vietnam by sharing her opinions and reviews on various real life digital marketing case studies.To find out more, you can visit her blogBinh Nguyen 2011 Interview on State of Digital Marketing in Vietnam1. What is your name? What do you do and how are you involved with digital marketing/ social media in Vietnam? My name is Binh Nguyen and I have been working in Vietnam as a marketer for the past decade. I write www.uselessmarketing.com as a resource for digital marketers in Vietnam, a forum for people to learn, argue, and grow beyond what is supposed to be “good enough” in marketing.2. How do you see Vietnam’s digital marketing/ social media landscape? I find a common issue is that marketers assume the default is good enough. By default, I mean that marketers are content to do what everyone else is doing, in assumption that this is the “safest” and most correct way. Companies reserve most of their marketing budget for traditional media even though internet usage is tremendously disproportionate to the current share of online spend. Even when companies do spend for online, a common practice is having banners linking to landing pages without a thought of what the landing page should do. Often, these pages are just boring text pages which lead to user simply clicking “close” on their browsers without taking a second glance at the content, basically losing all the momentum of the original ad. Even large multinationals are guilty of this, strangely, which means that less experienced, local firms follow the same route. In Vietnam, you could say that online marketing here in 2011 is similar to that in the US and Europe in 2001. Beyond the lack of understanding what digital marketing can be, there seems to be reluctance to admit that one should want to know what it can be.3. How receptive are the Vietnamese netizens when it comes to participating in digital marketing/ social media campaigns? Vietnamese are very receptive to advertising that’s done well. They “like” things, they participate in microsites. Vietnamese will participate in things that are personally relevant and provide some kind of value to them, whether that be enjoyment or an incentive, such as a prize.4. What are some of the unique characteristics of Vietnamese netizens? I think Vietnamese people as a whole are not so different from those in other countries. Older (40+) Vietnamese tend be less tech savvy, usually only familiar with computer technology if they work in an office. The younger generations tend be heavy consumers, playing games, watching videos, chatting, and listening to music. For those growing up today in the cities, the internet is a firm part of youth culture. The biggest difference between more developed nations and Vietnam is the use of the mobile phone. Mobile phone is by far the most dominant piece of technology in the country. There are over 120 million mobile numbers in use and over 80 million people with mobile phones. Contrast this with just 30 million people using the Internet in a country with about 90 million people. Culturally, there are a few services that seem to be more unique to Vietnam such as karaoke recording for sharing with the public, but overall, what is popular in other countries is also popular here.5. Which are the more popular digital platforms used by companies for their digital marketing campaigns today? How effective are these platforms in Vietnam’s context? Advertisers tend to go with Zing / Zing Me, Facebook, or microsites as the only marketing platforms. I would argue while there is nothing wrong with the platforms, I believe the reasons for using them are off-base. For example, Zing and Facebook are popular because of their number of users, but even combined, barely make up a third of the internet users here. What’s particularly difficult is that people who are not already members of these two communities have a difficult time joining an activity on them. Companies here are able to get 15,000 people to like your page, but they are unable to achieve much else, such as drives sales conversion or driving their fans to create buzz for them. The way most companies are using social media sites is a simple web page on a social network, with not much actual “social” action being created from the users. Microsites follow the same attributes in that they are described as social media sites, but very little sharing occurs. What’s worse is that I’ve heard that many companies don’t end up doing anything with the registered users that they spend so much money to obtain. They simply save them to a hard drive and store them on a server. There is no follow-up or conversion to a future campaign – each microsite simply starts over from scratch.6. What are the common methods that companies used to engage the audience on social media? I would say Fan Pages and simple Flash games on microsites are the most common ways to engage users online today in advertisement campaigns. I wouldn’t say that either is particularly social as they’re not being used in a social-optimized manner. Examples of real world cases are linked below.7. What are some of the common pitfalls that companies face when conducting digital marketing/ social media campaigns? How should they avoid them? I would consider the following critical to digital marketing campaigns, with some of my articles highlighting specific case studies from Vietnamese campaigns: 1.

I have been working in online industry since late 2005. For my work profile, please refer to linkedin. Right now I am managing a team of 20 specialists, providing online marketing (including SEO, PPC, social media) for clients in Vietnam.2. As a professional in the digital marketing industry, is the trend of SEO growing in Vietnam? Are companies there aware of it and is the pick up rate increasing? Yes SEO is definitely growing in Vietnam. However, the growth rate is not as expected. The level of understanding about SEO in the marketplace is still extremely limited. Myths and misconceptions are common. Pick up rate is increasing fast in the last 2 years or so.3. How important are digital marketing and SEO to companies in Vietnam today? Most companies want to be involved in digital marketing in general. However, they don’t know how. FMCGs (fast moving consumer goods) so far are the most active in digital marketing. SEO is just one part of the whole digital marketing picture and companies often consider it that way. They will invest holistically in digital, including SEO, not just SEO alone.4. Is there a rising trend of e-commerce in Vietnam? How has this affected the traditional business there? Yes there is. More and more e-commerce B2C sites are available in Vietnam. However, online payment is still the bottleneck together with security issues and personal preference. I don’t think traditional business cares that much about e-commerce yet in Vietnam.5. With regards to social media platforms, we have noticed that Vietnamese people tend to use their local versions of social networking sites such as ZingMe. Is there a reason why such websites are preferred to their western counterparts ie. Facebook? Has this also affected how digital marketing is used in Vietnam? Well, Facebook is actually the favorite social networking site for Vietnamese, especially Vietnamese office workers. However, local forums are commonly visited as well. ZingMe is used mostly by youngsters in Vietnam and people go there mostly to play games.6. Lastly, in your opinion what is the outlook for the digital marketing industry for Vietnam in the next few years? Digital marketing will grow at the rate of at least 60% per year in Vietnam. This is because of the low starting benchmark and the increased attention to digital media as a new platform to reach the targeted audience.Mr. Vuong Quang Khai is the Vice President – Web Business for VNG Corporation – a Vietnam-based internet giant whose portfolio includes social networking siteZingMe, music sharing site Zing MP3, various online games, and other famous brands.To find out more, you can visit his blog. Mr.Vuong Quang Khai 2011 Interview on Social Networking Sites and Zing Me1. We know that advertising on Facebook is all the rage these days. What do you think about an equal segment in ZingMe? How do corporations and enterprises use ZingMe, in relation to Facebook and Social Networking Sites (SNS)? Zing Me currently doesn’t provide advertising services. Fanpage function has not been promoted yet. It now mainly serves celebrities and has few enterprise profiles. Overall, so far, the Vietnam Social networking is not paying attention to business services. This will be Zing Me’s direction in the future.2. What is Zing Me’s direction for the upcoming period? In the period 2009-2010, Zing Me focuses on building features for end users (connection and entertainment). In 2011, Zing Me will switch to platform building strategy (opening Zing Me platform so that partners can easily build applications on Zing Me, or use the functionality available to do business). Three main benefit groups we will be focusing our resources on are: Business (and Marketing Agencies), celebrities (singers, actors, etc), and the user community (student groups, hobby clubs, etc).4. In your opinion, what is the future for marketing via SNS? Are there differences in how large enterprises and small and medium enterprises in Vietnam use SNS today? Yes SNS will become a major channel of communication to connect enterprise with customers and potential customers. However, approaching customers through SNS needs more optimization of maximum viral mechanisms and crowd power, not merely just building brand name awareness. Large enterprises in Vietnam mainly implement social media proposed by the agencies, or copy the campaigns that are being carried out by parent companies overseas. Small businesses have a more dynamic approach, but theirs are still quite primitive.5. In your opinion, what are the strengths of ZingMe compared with Facebook and other SNS products of Vietnam? Compared to Facebook, the biggest strength of Zing Me is that it is a product built by a team of Vietnamese, and focus on customer service in Vietnam. Therefore, we can create a product with localized features that best suits the needs and interests of Vietnamese people. Compared to other SNSs from Vietnam, Zing Me has the first mover advantage. We officially launched Zing users from 2009, two years earlier than other companies, and have gained a large number of users since then.Around 14 Feb 2011, there was a craze called Valentine of the Century (Valentine thế kỉ) that caused Vietnamese youths in Ho Chi Minh city to search for Closeuptoothpaste everywhere. The innovative and integrated Digital campaign lasted for 1.5 months from beginning January to 13 Feb 2011, ending with Valentine Couples night (The Crescent bridge Phu My Hung, Ho Chi Minh City) organized by Closeup for 100 couples.With the theme “Get Fresh, Get Charming”, 100 free tickets would be given away to 100 couples with the highest Fresh Coins. One could earn Freshcoins in many ways. On each tube of Closeup there was a Fresh code for Fresh Coins (hence the craze for Closeup toothpastes). With a Fresh code, participants could log onto the website to play 3D Games Fresh City (Thanh pho thom mat) to earn more fresh coins, or they could send their long-distance love story with supporting photos and videos to Fresh Love Marathon (Tinh yeu thom mat). This love story contest which created a craze on popular social network sites Facebook and ZingMe. Freshcoins could be earned as the results of “likes” for a love story, 3-D game wins, or Closeup purchases.[115] Apart from its interactive official website, the campaign created word-of-mouth via popular bloggers’ endorsement on their blog (Robbey’s and Meo Ac’s), and a series of viral Youtube videos. The Fresh Love Marathon contest also created buzz on Facebook and ZingMe.The campaign achieved extensive press coverage pre, during, and post-event. Its viral clip on Youtube got more than 80,000 views and sales of Closeup increased dramatically during the weeks of the event. Reports stated there could be up to 10 tubes per purchase. Implications Realizing opportunity in the festive mood of Valentine, the campaign leveraged on youth’s thirst for a place and ambience to celebrate V-Day, and created a romantic and innovative concept (with an element of dreams coming true by promising to reunite long-distance couples) with attractive prizes and therefore, was warmly welcomed by Vietnamese youths.Yo!Party was a publicity event sponsored by Dutch Lady to promote their YoMost brand. From the first round 05/11/2011 to the party on 12/02/2011, the event caught the attention of the online community in the biggest forums in Vietnam.Dutch Lady urged Vietnamese youths to create parties using 3-D virtual platform and promised 2 billion VND to make the best-styled party a reality and a prize of 200 million VND for the winner. There were 4 party themes: beach party, snow party, cruise party, or rooftop party.To start styling, participants needed a YoMost string with a scratch card attached to a unique code. With the unique code, they could go to the official website www.phongcachyo.com to start styling by purchasing various design items. They needed to invite their friends with unique codes for more points. The 10 best designs with the most points were chosen by the organizer after the first round. After the best party was determined by vote (via website or sms) in the second round, the fan-favourite was realized as a Dream Party.[116] Consumers had to exchange 1 block of YoMost for a ticket to the party.All its publicity efforts featured Vincent – a guy coined ‘Party God’. After a launch party with celebrity endorsements , the campaign generated substantial press coverage. Its official website featured blogs, video blogs (with a viral Youtube video) and 3-D design platforms for styling of parties. The campaign also maintained a Facebook Fanpage.At the same time, the Yo!Party contest created a lot of buzz on YAN, one of the biggest Vietnam forums on music and entertainment, due to a partnership between them. The forum had a whole new section dedicated to discussion and updates on Yo!Party, generating nearly 10,000 posts and comments in total. Results Yo!Party ended its second round with more than 20,000 fans on Facebook and more than 20000 views for its viral Youtube video. The contest itself also received 300,000 participants and 400,000 votes.[117] Fan-voted Snow Heaven party was held on 19/2/2011 at Hoa Lu stadium, which had more than 10,000 dancers, 10 DJs who danced for 21000 seconds non-stop, and many famous Vietnamese entertainers, like Ho Ngoc Ha and Noo Phuoc Thinh, performing.[118]Implications The success of this integrated campaign can be attributed to its innovative concept, which attracts Vietnamese youths, who are in need of a playground for creativity, festivity and connection. It was also able to create buzz around the event by extensive media coverage and by utilizing the popular social media platform, YAN forum, for word-of-mouth.",http://b-side.com.sg/?tag=trends,

Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws.She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek common-sense solutions to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers.About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders.States that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates, she said. The evidence is there. We know that.We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct.Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called  The Truth About Guns and Suicide , published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control.The report says, Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread.Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held.Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides, the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine.Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available.Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the . It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state.The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state.The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their , according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000.Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland.Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period.Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant.The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates.So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC.YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures.Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error.Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant.Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time, he said. For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not. These indicators, Hemenway said, don’t switch back and forth.Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates.It all makes sense psychologically, he said, since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent.Signer said states that have the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates.Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates.The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of  homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides.Editor's Note: An earlier headline on this story misspelled Signer's first name.",http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/apr/11/myra-signer/myra-signer-says-state-highest-gun-ownership-rates/,

Although homicide rates tend to be the focus of anti-gun rhetoric, guns are used even more frequently in suicides. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 21,175 firearm suicides in 2013 compared to 11,208 firearm homicides.Researchers from the Boston University School of Public Health have finished a study comparing the link between gun ownership and suicide rates across the U.S. Their findings show that states with higher rates of gun ownership also have higher rates of gun-related suicides.Our study adds to the consistent finding that among both males and females, increased prevalence of firearms is clearly associated with an increase in the firearm-specific suicide rate, said Dr. Michael Siegel, lead author and a professor of community health sciences, in a statement. The magnitude of this relationship is substantial and warrants attention from policymakers.Siegel and his colleagues combed through over 30 years of data on gun ownership and gender-specific suicide rates in all 50 states between 1981 and 2013. The average percentage of gun ownership for all states was 41 percent, ranging from as low as 12.2 percent in Hawaii to as high as 72.8 percent in Wyoming.Hawaii recorded the third-lowest suicide by firearm rate for males at 4.8 suicides per 100,000 people while Wyoming recorded the highest at 26.1 per 100,000. Massachusetts had the lowest rate of gun suicides for men at 4.2 per 100,000 and the second-lowest gun ownership rate. There was a noticeable disparity based on gender: Gun suicide rates among women were as low as 0.40 per 100,000 in New York and topped out at 4.2 per 100,000 in Nevada.Given that suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and firearm-related deaths and injuries are extraordinarily costly, reducing firearm-related self-injury and suicide is a public health imperative, said co-author Emily Rothman.Gun ownership was a significant predictor of male firearm suicide rates. In fact, firearm suicides among men increased by 3.3 per 100,000 for each 10 percent uptick in gun ownership. Firearm suicides among women increased 0.5 per 100,000 for every 10 percent jump in gun ownership. Owning a gun also led to higher rates of suicide by any means among men but not women.Reductions in the prevalence of firearms may be an effective strategy for reducing overall and firearm-related suicides among males and for reducing firearm-related suicides among females,” the research team added.Researchers from Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research conducted a similar study that compared gun policies in Missouri and Connecticut, which passed a law in 1995 that requires people to pass a background check before obtaining a permit or license to purchase a handgun. Missouri, on the other hand, repealed its gun purchaser licensing law in 2007. Connecticut’s stricter gun ownership law led to a 15.4 percent drop in firearm suicides while Missouri’s laxer laws meant a 16.1 percent increase.Source: Rothman E, Siegel M.

For women, firearm suicide rates increased 0.5 per 100,000 for each 10 percent increase in gun ownership. The study also found an association between gun ownership rates and suicides by any means (including non-gun-related acts) among males, but not among females.Over the 33-year study period, the mean estimated percentage of gun ownership ranged from a low of 12.2 percent in Hawaii to a high of 72.8 percent in Wyoming, with an average for all states of 41 percent. Hawaii had the third-lowest suicide gun suicide rate for males (4.8 per 100,000) among all states, while Wyoming had the highest rate (26.1 per 100,000). Massachusetts, with the lowest gun suicide rate in the country for men (4.2 per 100,000) had the second-lowest gun ownership rate.The mean adjusted gun suicide rate among women over the study period ranged from a low of 0.40 per 100,000 in New York to a high of 4.2 per 100,000 in Nevada. The average gun suicide rate for both genders declined slightly from 1981 to 2013.Siegel and Rothman noted that past studies exploring the association between firearm ownership and suicides had produced mixed results, with some failing to find any relationship. They said that by analyzing three decades worth of data, examining gender-specific suicide rates, and accounting for a host of state-specific factors that could potentially confound the association, they had controlled for as many variables as possible. The study controlled for income, education divorce rate and crime, among many other factors.Siegel noted that because there is no state-level data on firearm ownership, the researchers used a “proxy measure” of firearm ownership that estimates ownership based on the percentage of suicides in which a firearm was used and a state’s hunting license rate. The “well-established” proxy has a 95 percent correlation with survey-measured gun ownership rates, he said.He said the study suggests that lowering gun ownership rates could reduce gun-related suicides. For example, if the firearm ownership in Wyoming dropped from 72.8 percent to 41 percent (the average for all states), the male firearm suicide rate could be expected to decline by 38 percent, and the female rate by 56 percent. Overall male suicide rates in Wyoming, including those by means other than guns, would be expected to fall 16 percent, based on the study’s model.Siegel and Rothman said the key public health implication of their findings is that “reductions in the prevalence of firearms may be an effective strategy for reducing overall and firearm-related suicides among males and for reducing firearm-related suicides among females. “Approximately 40,000 people die as a result of suicide each year in the US, at an estimated cost of $44 billion a year. While gun homicides are more frequently reported, the number of gun suicides per year is almost twice as high.

The attack comes just one month after the worst mass shooting in the US, and has again raised questions about gun ownership and whether there should be tougher controls.About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one, according to a 2017 survey, and the rate of murder or manslaughter by firearm is the highest in the developed world. There were more than 11,000 deaths as a result of murder or manslaughter involving a firearm in 2016.Homicides are taken here to include murder and manslaughter. The FBI separates statistics for what it calls justifiable homicide, which includes the killing of a criminal by a police officer or private citizen in certain circumstances, which are not included.While it is difficult to know exactly how many guns civilians own around the world, by every estimate the US with around 270 million is far out in front.Switzerland and Finland are the European countries with the most guns per person - they both have compulsory military service for all men over the age of 18. Cyprus, Austria and Yemen also have military service.There have been more than 90 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones.Up until 2012, a mass shooting was defined as when an attacker had killed four or more victims in an indiscriminate rampage - and since 2013 the figures include attacks with three or more victims. The shootings do not include killings related to other crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence.The overall number of people killed in mass shootings each year represents only a tiny percentage of the total number.There were nearly twice as many suicides involving firearms in 2015 as there were murders involving guns, and the rate has been increasing in recent years. Suicide by firearm accounts for almost half of all suicides in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found there was a strong relationship between higher levels of gun ownership in a state and higher firearm suicide rates for both men and women.The average age of attackers in 91 recorded US mass shootings is 34.Paddock is one of three killers aged over 60. The others are: William D Baker, 66, who killed five people in Illinois in 2001; and Kurt Myers, 64, who killed five people in New York state in 2013.The youngest killer is Andrew Douglas Golden, 11, who ambushed students and teachers as they left Westside Middle School in Arkansas, 1998. He was jointly responsible with Mitchell Scott Johnson, 13, for five deaths and 10 injured.The Las Vegas attack was the worst in recent US history - and the three shootings with the highest number of casualties have all happened within the past 10 years.Military-style assault weapons have been blamed for some of the major mass shootings such as the attack in an Orlando nightclub and at the Sandy Hook School in Connecticut. The police said dozens of rifles had been recovered from the scene of the Las Vegas shooting.A few US states have banned assault weapons, which were totally restricted for a decade until 2004. However most murders caused by guns involve handguns, according to FBI data.For those from countries where guns are not widely owned, it can be a surprise to discover that they are relatively cheap to purchase in the US.Handguns, which were reportedly among Paddock's arsenal discovered in his hotel room, can cost from as little $200 (£151) - as much as a Chromebook laptop for example - and can be bought from gun shops.Assault rifles like the ones also reportedly found in Paddock's room can cost from around $1500 (£1,132).Given that 23 weapons were found at the hotel and further 19 at his home, Paddock may have spent more than $70,000 (£52,800) on weapons and accessories, such as tripods, scopes, ammunition and cartridges.US public opinion on the banning of handguns has changed dramatically over the last 60 years. This dataset is incomplete but it shows that support has shifted over time and now a significant majority opposes a ban on handguns, according to polling by Gallup.Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restricting the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill, or on watch lists.But Republicans and Democrats are much more divided over other policy proposals, such as whether to allow ordinary citizens increased rights to carry concealed weapons - according to a survey from Pew Research Center.In his latest comment on the shootings, President Donald Trump said he would be talking about gun laws as times goes by. The White House said now is not the time to be debating gun control.His predecessor, Barack Obama, struggled to get any new gun control laws onto the statute books, because of Republican opposition.The National Rifle Association (NRA) campaigns against all forms of gun control in the US and argues that more guns make the country safer.It is among the most powerful special interest lobby groups in the US, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy.In total about one in five US gun owners say they are members of the NRA - and it has especially widespread support from Republican-leaning gun owners, according to Pew Research.In terms of lobbying, the NRA officially spends about $3m per year to influence gun policy.The chart shows only the recorded contributions to lawmakers published by the Senate Office of Public Records. The NRA spends millions more elsewhere, such as on supporting the election campaigns of political candidates who oppose gun controls.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081,

It’s one of the few countries in which the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected. But America’s relationship with guns is unique in another crucial way: Among developed nations, the US is far and away the most violent — in large part due to the easy access many Americans have to firearms. These charts and maps show what that violence looks like compared with the rest of the world, why it happens, and why it’s such a tough problem to fix.This chart, compiled using United Nations data collected by Simon Rogers for the Guardian, shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. Why? Extensive reviews of the research by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center suggest the answer is pretty simple: The US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations.In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded as of October 2017.The counts come via the Gun Violence Archive, which has hosted a database that tracks mass shootings since 2013. But since some shootings go unreported, the database is likely missing some, as well as the details of some of the events.The tracker uses a fairly broad definition of “mass shooting”: It includes not just shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter).Even under this broad definition, it’s worth noting that mass shootings make up a tiny portion of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled more than 33,000 in 2014.Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue that it’s inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a strong supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for “trying to score cheap political points” when Obama mentioned gun control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will never be the right time to discuss mass shootings, as Christopher Ingraham pointed out at the Washington Post. Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has nearly one mass shooting a day. So if lawmakers are forced to wait for a time when there isn’t a mass shooting to talk gun control, they could find themselves waiting for a very long time.Using data from a study in Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mother Jones put together the chart above that shows states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths. And it’s not just one study. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.When economist Richard Florida took a look at gun deaths and other social indicators, he found that higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness didn’t correlate with more gun deaths. But he did find one telling correlation: States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. (Read more at Florida’s “The Geography of Gun Deaths.”)This is backed by other research: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.The good news is that all firearm homicides, like all homicides and crime, have declined over the past two decades. (Although that may have changed in 2015 and 2016, with a recent rise in murders nationwide.)There’s still a lot of debate among criminal justice experts about why this crime drop is occurring — some of the most credible ideas include mass incarceration, more and better policing, and reduced lead exposure from gasoline. But one theory that researchers have widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime — in fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Center.Although America’s political debate about guns tends to focus on grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, this is actually one of the most compelling reasons for reducing access to guns — there is a lot of research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide.Perhaps the reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and poison.Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, previously explained that this is why reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides: Just stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a huge difference.“Time is really key to preventing suicide in a suicidal person,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “First, the crisis won’t last, so it will seem less dire and less hopeless with time. Second, it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help. That’s why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful.”She added, “[I]f we keep the method of suicide away from a person when they consider it, in that moment they will not switch to another method. It doesn’t mean they never will. But in that moment, their thinking is very inflexible and rigid. So it’s not like they say, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to work. I’m going to try something else.’ They generally can’t adjust their thinking, and they don’t switch methods.”When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides. The data above, taken from a study by Australian researchers, shows that suicides dropped dramatically after the Australian government set up a gun buyback program that reduced the number of firearms in the country by about one-fifth.The Australian study found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking.Australia is far from alone in these types of results. A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent — particularly on weekends — when the military stopped letting soldiers take their guns home over the weekend.This data and research have a clear message: States and countries can significantly reduce the number of suicides by restricting access to guns.Since police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014, police have killed at least 2,902 people as of May 2017.Fatal Encounters, a nonprofit, has tracked these killings by collecting reports from the media, public, and law enforcement and verifying them through news reports. Some of the data is incomplete, with details about a victim’s race, age, and other factors sometimes missing. It also includes killings that were potentially legally justified, and is likely missing some killings entirely.A huge majority of the 1,112 deaths on the map are from gunshots, which is hardly surprising given that guns are so deadly compared with other tools used by police. There are also noticeable numbers of fatalities from vehicle crashes, stun guns, and asphyxiations. In some cases, people died from stab wounds, medical emergencies, and what’s called “suicide by cop,” when people kill themselves by baiting a police officer into using deadly force.Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it isn’t too surprising that, as a study in the American Journal of Public Health found, states with more guns also have more cops die in the line of duty.Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and homicides of police officers across the US over 15 years. They found that states with more gun ownership had more cops killed in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15-year study period.The findings could help explain why US police officers appear to kill more people than cops in other developed countries. For US police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence — even against them — in America mean they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result.Over the past 20 years, Americans have clearly shifted from supporting gun control measures to greater support of “protecting the right of Americans to own guns,” according to Pew Research Center surveys. This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have received more press attention.Although mass shootings are often viewed as some of the worst acts of gun violence, they seem to have little effect on public opinion about gun rights, based on surveys from the Pew Research Center. That helps explain why Americans’ support for the right to own guns appears to be rising over the past 20 years even as more of these mass shootings make it to the news.Although Americans say they want to protect the right to bear arms, they’re very much supportive of many gun policy proposals — including some fairly contentious ideas, such as more background checks on private and gun show sales and banning semi-automatic and assault-style weapons, according to Pew Research Center surveys.This type of contradiction isn’t exclusive to gun policy issues. For example, although most Americans in the past said they don’t like Obamacare, most of them also said they like the specific policies in the health-care law. Americans just don’t like some policy ideas until you get specific.For people who believe the empirical evidence that more guns mean more violence, this contradiction is the source of a lot of frustration.

Armed citizens are standing “guard” outside of military recruitment offices around the country after the Tennessee shooting that killed four last week (and occasionally accidentally firing their guns).Following the latest US mass shooting, which killed two people plus the shooter himself and wounded nine at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, the gun control debate is likely to flare up again. And a look at US gun ownership and gun death statistics casts some doubt on the “good guy with a gun” theory.Complete and recent breakdowns of gun ownership by state are difficult to find, in part because the National Rifle Association has long pushed to stifle funding for research on guns’ impact on American society. Even based on limited information, though, there appears to be a relationship between high rates of gun deaths and high rates of gun ownership.The most complete state-by-state ownership data comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics, from a 2005 report using data from a 2002 survey. Overall, America average household gun ownership rate is 32%, but that varies widely by state:The most complete, most recent data on state-by-state deaths related to guns comes from the US’s latest National Vital Statistics report, released this February and using 2013 data, which has been broken out by the Henry J.

These are the 10 states with the highest rate of gun deaths in the country:These states all have much higher rates of gun ownership than the average, and are among the top 20 US states when ranked by gun ownership rates (with the exception of New Mexico, which is one of the US’s deadliest and ranks 27th):",https://qz.com/437015/mapped-the-us-states-with-the-most-gun-owners-and-most-gun-deaths/,

Rates of gun ownership also appear to be a major factor.You probably saw the headlines late last week: suicides among middle-aged Americans appear to have surged over the past decade. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently found the suicide rate for people aged 35 to 64 jumped 28 percent between 1999 and 2010, a troubling development by any measure. This means more Americans now die of suicide than of car accidents. Given the nation's recent economic history, it's understandable that everyone is looking to define the relationship between suicides and the recession. The CDC report itself cites several studies that point to a connection between the twoThe chart above shows the 10 states with the most significant increases in their suicide rates from 1999 to 2010, based on data from the CDC report. Wyoming tops the list with an increase of nearly 80 percent. North Dakota is second and Rhode Island third, both with increases of roughly 70 percent. Hawaii, Vermont, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Oregon, and South Dakota round out the top 10. While much has been made of the connection between rising suicide and the economic crisis, many, if not most, of the states on this list have had relatively stable economies over the course of the crisis and recovery. The Dakotas have been held out as examples of economic stability and growth throughout the crisis. Indiana is the only Rust Belt state to make the top 10 list — Michigan and other hard-hit industrial states are curiously absent. None of the Sun Belt states that were devastated by the housing crisis — Arizona, Florida, or Nevada — are among the top 10 either. Also curiously absent are high-priced, allegedly high-stress East and West Coast states such as New York or California, while more laid back states — Hawaii, Vermont, Oregon, and Idaho as well as Plains states — dominate the top 10 for highest increases in suicide rates. While the economic crisis has clearly been a contributing factor to America's rising suicide rate, perhaps it is not the only, or even the most important factor, behind the surge. In fact, another key factor appears to be at play: guns. Guns are the leading cause of suicide by far, according to the CDC report, accounting for nearly half (48 percent) all suicides among adults ages 35 to 64 in 2010. Slightly less than a quarter of suicides of people in this age group are caused by suffocation, and another 22 percent are poisonings, mainly drug overdoses.Gun ownership rates, as well as gun control measures, vary substantially by state. According to a recent Pew Research Center report, over 60 percent of all firearm deaths in 2010 were suicides. (While nationwide gun homicide rates were nearly halved between 1993 to 2010, gun suicides have seen a far smaller rate of decrease, declining from a high of 7.6 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 5.7 in 2006, before bouncing back up to 6.3 in 2010). The close connection between gun ownership and suicide has indeed been documented in several detailed state-level studies. A Harvard School of Public Health study found gun ownership to be the overriding factor in accounting for state-by-state differences in suicide after controlling for mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, and other factors. A website for a Harvard suicide-prevention campaign explains: The higher suicide rates result from higher firearm suicides; the non-firearm suicide rate is about equal across states. The Harvard School of Public Health News, which summarized the main findings of the study, notes that in states where guns were prevalent—as in Wyoming, where 63 percent of households reported owning guns—rates of suicide were higher. The inverse was also true: where gun ownership was less common, suicide rates were also lower.",https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/05/hidden-geography-americas-surging-suicide-rate/5489/,

There appears to be a correlation between suicide by firearm and the rate of gun ownership.,Gun Laws vs Gun Deaths,"Firearm legislation is a much discussed issue these days, and there are many opinions that surround it. Statistics can even be unpacked to adhere to certain viewpoints on the topic. For example, the U.S. has the highest rate of gun violence when compared with Western Europe, but falls around the median when compared with countries in North and South America.Similarly, some states have more issues with firearms than others. The South, in particular, is a consistently high-risk area for firearm violence, while California and much of the Northeast have per capita rates that pale in comparison. However, some states with strict gun laws, such as Illinois, can still have significant rates of gun deaths, while states with extremely lax gun legislation, such as Arizona, aren’t quite as high on the list as you might expect.Knowing the facts about firearms, crime trends in the U.S., and the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of gun legislation are a vital part of staying safe and informed. Continue reading to see the relationship between gun laws and gun deaths in the U.S.While it’s true there are about as many guns in America as there are people, not every resident possesses a firearm. In fact, one-third of U.S. residents are gun owners. However, it bears mentioning gun ownership is more concentrated in some areas of the country than others.Alaska has the highest rate of gun ownership in the U.S., with nearly 62 percent of adults owning a gun. Arkansas and Idaho have the next most gun owners (58 percent and 57 percent, respectively). The most salient reason behind firearm ownership is the prevalence of gun culture, or the acceptance of firearms by friends, family, and associates.While firearm homicides are a major cause for concern, suicide by firearm makes up almost two-thirds of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. In fact, the number of firearm homicides has been on a general decline since 1993, while firearm-related suicides have increased in recent years.Broken down, about 36,100 people die from firearms each year in the U.S. Suicides make up over 21,300 of those deaths, while homicides make up nearly 11,000. Legal intervention and accidental discharge of firearms are each responsible for roughly 500 deaths annually.For every category except suicide, victims are, on average, between the ages of 15 and 34. While victims of self-inflicted gunshot wounds are usually between the ages of 45 and 64, the rate of suicide is relatively high for all involved age groups compared with other categories of death by firearm.Suicide is the most common cause of death by firearm. There appears to be a correlation between suicide by firearm and the rate of gun ownership.Alaska may have the highest firearm suicide rate because of its Alaska Native population. The suicide rate among Alaska Natives was about three times that of non-native Alaskan residents from 2003 to 2006. However, factors used to explain Montana’s high rate of suicide – including isolation and alcoholism – may apply to other states as well. Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana also have the lowest population density.Alternatively, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have the lowest firearm suicide rates and are the top three states regarding population density.Homicide makes up about one-third of all firearm-related deaths. Firearms were used in nearly 72 percent of murders nationwide in 2015. Additionally, Louisiana and Mississippi have disproportionately high firearm homicide rates. Notably, most of the bottom 10 states for firearm homicides, except New York and Connecticut, are in the bottom 10 for gun ownership.Florida passed a Stand Your Ground law in 2005, and saw a sharp 32% increase in gun-related homicides over the 10 years to follow. 23 other states passed stand your ground laws between 2006 and 2011. Florida appears to be the most dramatic example of a relationship between Stand Your Ground and gun deaths.Southern states along the Mississippi River have consistently reported some of the highest rates of firearm deaths. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas currently fall within the top 10 for firearm deaths. One legislative similarity that all of these states share is that none of them require license, registration or permit to buy a gun, though there are dozens of other states with the same regulations. Still, the states surrounding the Mississippi River Delta were rated as some of the most lenient in terms of gun law stringency, according to Crimadvisor.Conversely, while Washington and Rhode Island have some of the most restrictive gun laws in the U.S., they fall on the lower end of firearm death rates in the country. Six out of the top 10 states for firearm deaths enacted stand your ground laws around 2006.The issue of gun violence is extremely complicated and varied across state laws and local culture. Many states support the notion that firearm regulation is a necessary measure in preventing and reducing gun deaths; however, many other states do not take this stance.While the facts may speak for themselves in the debate over gun violence, they don’t necessarily point toward a catch-all solution on their own. Until this solution is found, though, it’s our duty to stay knowledgeable about the issues and to practice responsible gun ownership at all times.Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting database, and other sources, we compiled rates of gun ownership, firearm deaths including suicide, homicide, accidental death and legal intervention, and the stringency of gun laws across the U.S.It's safe to use the graphics above in your content.

Louisiana. According to the Violence Policy Center, 45.6 percent of homes have a gun. The state had almost 19 gun-related deaths per 100,000 residents in 2011, the most in the nation. It had the country’s highest murder rate, and its gun suicide rate also was higher than the national average. “Louisiana residents also struggle with high poverty rates and poor educational attainment,” 247wallstreet.com said, noting it was the third poorest state with almost 20 percent of residents below the official poverty line. “Like other states on this list, Louisiana’s gun laws do not require residents to have a pernit before purchasing a handgun.”2. Mississippi.According to VPC, 54.3 percent of homes have a gun. Mississippi also has the nation’s highest poverty rate, 24.4 percent in 2012, and the second highest murder rate, according to 247wallstreet.com. “The state’s suicide rate was also quite high,” its analysis said, “and it trailed behind most states in other factors such as access to basic necessities, health care, and household income.”3. Alaska. Unlike the deep South, poverty is not an obvious factor. Alaska has some of the “highest educational attainment rates and median household incomes,” 247wallst.com said. But easy access to guns means that guns are used more often. Alaska has the second highest rate of violent crimes of any state, second only to Tennessee. And it has the country's third highest rate of gun suicides.

But even as Congress continues to prevent the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting meaningful gun violence research, independent studies occasionally crop up, shedding light on gun violence even as it quickly becomes one of America’s most significant preventable causes of death.One such study, recently published in the American Journal of Public Health, reports that states with higher rates of gun ownership also have higher rates of gun-related suicides. The findings highlight the fact that gun violence does not stop at homicides and mass shootings—poorly regulated firearms may also be helping at-risk people take their own lives.“Our study adds to the consistent finding that among both males and females, increased prevalence of firearms is clearly associated with an increase in the firearm-specific suicide rate,” coauthor Michael Siegel, professor at Boston University, said in a press statement. “The magnitude of this relationship is substantial and warrants attention from policymakers.”National conversation surrounding gun violence tends to peak immediately after mass shootings or high-profile gun homicides, but suicide, while less prone to grabby headlines, is far deadlier. In 2013 alone the CDC reported 11,208 firearm homicides, but 21,175 firearm suicides—nearly double that figure. Those 21,175 firearm suicides also account for more than half of the estimated 40,000 suicides in the U.S. each year.In an effort to learn more about the causes of firearm suicides (and how we might prevent them), researchers from Boston University estimated levels of gun ownership per state, based on the percentage of suicides in which a firearm was used and a state’s hunting license rate. Although this is not an ideal metric for measuring gun ownership, states do not provide official data on gun ownership rates, and prior studies have demonstrated that this method has a 95 percent correlation with the slightly more robust data gathered from in-person surveys.The researchers found that the average gun ownership rate per state was 41 percent. Hawaii had the lowest rates, at roughly 12 percent, while Wyoming had the highest rates, at closer to 73 percent. When they then compared each states’ estimated gun ownership rate to its official suicide rate, they found that firearm ownership was a significant predictor of male (but not female) firearm suicide. Wyoming had one of the highest firearm suicide rates, while Hawaii had one of the lowest. Curiously, the researchers also found an, albeit weaker, correlation between gun ownership rates and total rates of suicide by any means.There are several limitations to this study, however. The most glaring is that the data on gun ownership rates is culled partially from state-wide firearm suicide figures, which almost ensures that there will be a correlation between one and the other. Furthermore, the findings are just that—a correlation. The study is retrospective in nature, and cannot demonstrate that firearms cause suicides, just that states with more gun owners tend to have more suicides. Indeed, some prior studies (often with substantial conflicts of interest) have found that gun control does not reduce suicide rates. All in all, these findings warrant further study.Nonetheless, the research has important implications. “Given that suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and firearm-related deaths and injuries are extraordinarily costly, reducing firearm-related self-injury and suicide is a public health imperative,” said coauthor Emily Rothman of Boston University, in a prepared statement. “Reductions in the prevalence of firearms may be an effective strategy for reducing overall and firearm-related suicides.”",http://www.vocativ.com/321192/guns-suicides/index.html,
States with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates.,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/apr/11/myra-signer/myra-signer-says-state-highest-gun-ownership-rates/,True,Can not judge,Unrelated,True,Can not judge,Can not judge,,What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings? International Comparisons Suggest an Answer,"Worldwide, Mr. Lankford found, a country’s rate of gun ownership correlated with the odds it would experience a mass shooting. This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html,

A chart with the Tribune story presents the state’s most-spoken languages other than English under this summary: Of the nearly 24 million people in Texas five years or older, 65 percent speak only English at home.

That count trailed only the 2014 survey’s tally of English-only speakers in Texas (16,126,855) and Spanish speakers (7,465,279).Some perspective; 65 percent of the estimated 25 million Texans age 5 or older speak only English at home, according to the survey, and 30 percent speak Spanish--while only 0.81 percent speak Vietnamese. That is, there’s a big dropoff from second to third place.Bernstein also provided national results on languages spoken at home. According to the 2014 ACS, 79 percent of the 299 million U.S. residents 5 or older speak only English, 13 percent speak Spanish and, in third place, about 5.5 percent speak French. Next, per the survey, 1 percent of residents speak Chinese at home with 0.5 percent, nearly 1.5 million residents, speaking Vietnamese.We also heard back from Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, who noted by email that according to the ACS covering 2010-2014, English, Spanish and Vietnamese were the three most-spoken languages in Texas.

But changing immigration patterns are increasing the number of other foreign languages spoken in Texas households, from Vietnamese and Chinese to Tagalog, the language spoken in the Philippines.“In some ways it speaks to immigrant patterns,” said state demographer Lloyd Potter. “Most of the individuals who are speaking a language other than English at home are fairly recent immigrants.”Texas has seen dramatic fluctuations in the origin of its incoming immigrants in the last decade. Though people born in Latin American countries continue to make up the largest group of immigrants in Texas, their share has decreased from 69.4 percent in 2005 to 42.9 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, the share of Asian immigrants to Texas has more than doubled, from 17.3 percent in 2005 to 40.4 percent in 2013.Those Asian migrants have not dispersed across the state in equal numbers; they've largely settled in the state’s big metropolitan areas, like Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Travis counties — what Potter calls little enclaves of language concentration. Compared to the state overall, those four counties have a larger share of residents who speak languages other than English or Spanish at home.Among the major metropolitan areas, Bexar County has the largest share of residents who speak Spanish at home, while Tarrant and Travis counties have the smallest shares.That means English as a Second Language (ESL) classes like the one at First United Methodist Church in Austin are more likely to enroll immigrants who speak neither English nor Spanish at home.“People tend to think when we say ESL class, ‘Oh, you have people from Mexico,’” but Spanish-speakers only make up a fourth of the students, said Catherine Bingaman, the church’s director of ESL education. At First United, ESL classes are largely made up of immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Europe, and cite employment as the main reason they are working to improve their English, Bingaman said.In the Houston area, a common immigrant resettlement spot, public schools face some of the toughest challenges associated with a growing number of spoken languages.In Fort Bend County, which has been called the most ethnically diverse county in America, the school district is charged with educating children who speak up to 100 different languages at home. Only 17 percent of the Fort Bend Independent School District’s student population is white. Asians and Middle Eastern students make up a quarter of the student population; of the remaining students, half are black and half are Hispanic.District administrators say this demographic breakdown has prompted them to offer ESL courses at all but a handful of campuses, consider bilingual skills in hiring of faculty and staff and invest in ESL certification for teachers. With a large Asian and Middle Eastern student population — and a correspondingly wide range of languages spoken — parents will often bring their own translators when meeting with teachers or school officials, said Lupita Garcia, the district’s senior executive director for federal and special programs.“It brings very unique challenges to us in that respect, Garcia said, because there’s also the cultural divide in learning as well as language [and] communicating with the parents about our culture, our schools and our expectations.",https://www.texastribune.org/2015/11/26/languages-spoken-texas-homes/,

As you'd probably guess, the second-most common language spoken in the U.S. is Spanish. But if you look at the most common languages after English and Spanish, the results get a little more surprising, especially when you parse them by state.Using data from the American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau, where respondents were asked to list the languages spoken in their household, Ben Blatt from Slate made maps of the most commonly spoken language in each state.Spanish blankets the country except for two French areas: in a handful of states near the Canadian border and Louisiana. Yupik, a Native American language, is the second-most spoken language in Alaska, and Tagalog is popular in Hawaii thanks to the large Filipino population. Now keep your eye on that German-speaking pocket in North Dakota.If we remove Spanish from the mix, we start to see some truly surprising trends. All sorts of ethnic, immigration, and cultural patterns start to reveal themselves. You can see more Native American languages like Navajo and Dakota, lots of Korean and Vietnamese states, and plenty of our original Colonial Era holdouts: Italian, French, Portuguese. Then there are some outliers like Russian, Arabic, Hmong, and French Creole. And I don't think I would have guessed Tagalog would be the third-most spoken language in California.The most shocking fact to me was seeing all the households that speak German—I can't say it's a language I hear hardly anywhere except when I travel to Europe. However, the prevalence of all those German-speaking states doesn't mean that German is the third most-spoken language by Americans. The third-most spoken language in the U.S. overall? Chinese.

",John Cornyn Continues Outreach to Vietnamese Texans,"According to the 2010 Census, Texas is home to more than 210,000 Vietnamese-Americans. Texas is home to the second largest Vietnamese population after California, with large communities in the Houston, Dallas, and Austin areas. Most Vietnamese Texans are first or second-generation Americans, making bilingual communication an essential element of any outreach efforts.The Vietnamese population in America was virtually nonexistent until the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, when political refugees first started arriving. Another wave, peaking in 1992, immigrated after the Refugee Act of 1980. Related laws granted additional opportunities to political prisoners, children of American servicemen, and those who had belonged to or supported the South Vietnamese military and were suffering retaliation from the communist Vietnamese government.Predictably, Cornyn’s announcement was met with skepticism from Texas Democrats, including his opponent on the November ballot, David Alameel, who attacked Cornyn as being “anti-immigrant” and dismissed his efforts as “futile.”This skepticism is unwarranted, according to Dr. Tram Ho, a Houston-area internal medicine doctor who spoke exclusively to Breitbart Texas about the Vietnamese community in Texas and Senator Cornyn’s outreach efforts. Dr. Ho and her father, a former officer in the South Vietnamese military, were imprisoned by the Vietnamese government shortly after the war ended, when she was just 10 years old. They escaped on boats to a refugee camp in Hong Kong, and then came to the United States when she was 13, along with her siblings. Her mother and youngest brother escaped a few years later and were finally reunited with them.“We are very passionate about human rights,” said Ho, “because many of us escaped from Vietnam as political dissidents and still have family ties back there. We love this country because of the freedom and feel so sorry for [friends and family] back in Vietnam who can’t enjoy these rights.. What we are thirsty for is to bring these human rights to Vietnam, and then democracy will bring Vietnam to be a truer and closer ally to the United States.”Ho first met Cornyn in 2008, when she contacted his office to seek help for Father Nguyen Van Ly, a Catholic priest who had been imprisoned for criticizing the Vietnamese government. Ly had suffered a stroke in prison and there were concerns that he was not receiving adequate medical care while incarcerated.After Ho and other members of the Vietnamese community contacted Cornyn and members of Texas’ Congressional delegation, Cornyn and others publicly spoke in support of Ly and were able to secure his temporary release to receive medical treatment. The Vietnamese government sent Ly back behind bars and efforts continue to secure his permanent release, but the temporary release undoubtedly saved his life.According to Ho, Cornyn was a “tremendous help” in securing Ly’s temporary release from jail, and in advocating for the rights of other dissidents imprisoned in Vietnam. Ho also spoke about how Cornyn was “passionate” about the “human rights of the Vietnamese people,” sponsoring several human rights bills, publicly speaking out against efforts by the Vietnamese government to retaliate against its critics, and pressuring President Obama to take action.Bloggers in Vietnam are in an especially precarious position, as the government controls all aspects of media. “Freedom of speech and journalism are ‘zero’ there,” Ho told Breitbart Texas. “They simply do not exist.” Bloggers have to register with their real names, and internet access is limited and requires prior approval, most have no choice but to use public internet cafes where every keystroke is monitored and reported to the government.This past May, Dr. Cu Huy Ha Vu was released after spending several years in jail for criticizing the government. Cornyn had drafted a letter to Obama before he was to meet with Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang in August 2013 urging the release of Dr. Vu and two other bloggers who worked with him named Dieu Cay and Ta Phong Tan.This year, five other Vietnamese dissidents besides Dr. Vu were released as a result of pressure from the United States and Europe, but more than 200 still remain imprisoned, including Dr. Vu’s two co-bloggers. Vietnam is second only to China in jailing journalists, bloggers, and political and religious dissidents.When asked about the Cornyn campaign’s new Vietnamese website, Ho was supportive and cheered the effort. Noting that the language gap hinders the outreach efforts of many candidates, she described the website as “a crucial, important way to reach out to the Vietnamese-American voter” that would create opportunities for outreach that would otherwise not be available.Cornyn’s Vietnamese website joins the campaign’s current English and Spanish websites and will be a part of Cornyn’s “Keep it Red” statewide grassroots outreach efforts. As of today, it appears to be the only Vietnamese-language website among all the statewide candidates in Texas.In a statement released by the campaign, Cornyn said, “I think it’s important to serve all 26 million Texans as U.S. Senator, so my campaign is reaching out to many different communities around the state. The Vietnamese Texans have always been a hardworking, faithful people who cherish freedom, entrepreneurship and education. I know that we share common values, and I want Vietnamese Texans to make their home inside the Republican Party.”“Texas is an increasingly diverse state,” added Cornyn social media coordinator Amy Miller. “Senator Cornyn recognizes that it’s time to stop talking at people, and start talking to them about the conservative policies that make Texas great. So many of these communities have never had the opportunity to talk to conservative campaigns, and our goal is to change that, starting now. We need to keep building relationships and reaching out to new voters, and if speaking a little Spanish or Vietnamese helps, we’re up to the challenge.”Sarah Rumpf is a political and communications consultant living in Austin.

Former President Jimmy Carter famously characterized it in a slightly different way.“We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic, the former president said. “Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.Whether melting pot or mosaic, the U.S. is undeniably defined by its rich diversity — exemplified in the sheer number of languages spoken in American homes. A U.S. Census Bureau report published in 2015 found at least 350 languages are spoken in homes across the country.But which languages are spoken by the most U.S. residents? And if we zoom in on specific sections of the map, what are the influences of these languages? Here’s the list of the 6 most spoken languages in the U.S. as determined by the number of people who speak the language at home.While it should come as no surprise that English is the most spoken language in the United States, you may be surprised to learn it’s not the country’s official language. The U.S. doesn’t have an official language on the books, but the topic has sparked a fiery debate that goes back centuries. Proponents of making English the official language typically fall on the conservative side of the political scale, while opponents are usually more left-leaning and pro-immigrant. Despite the lack of an official language on a federal level, more than half of the 50 states have passed laws giving English official language status.Official language or not, English speakers make up an enormous portion of the U.S. population. But with such a wide array of regional dialects, it can sound like there are many different versions of English being spoken in various parts of the country.Long Island University’s Robert Delaney created this map, which divides the U.S. into 24 distinct dialects. That’s a lot of variation for a single language (and that doesn’t include the forms of English spoken in other parts of the world)! In one corner of the country you may be “pahking the cah, while in another “ya’ll fixin’ to eat supper. In a sense, the stark contrasts in grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation make each region its own separate world.While the number of native Spanish speakers in the U.S. is significantly less than that of English speakers, Spanish is one of the fastest growing languages in the country — it increased by 233% between 1980 and 2013, according to Pew Research Center. In fact, there are more Spanish speakers in the U.S. than in Spain, making it second only to Mexico in Spanish speaking population.Further evidence of the ubiquity of Spanish in America can be found in both geographic enclaves and Americans’ everyday lexicons. Hispanic communities are located in every state, with particularly large concentrations of Spanish speakers in major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Miami, as well as in large sections of the Southwest (sometimes still referred to as “El Norte because California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas composed the northernmost region of Mexico until 1848).In terms of vocabulary, Spanish words and phrases have made their way into American English, perhaps most visibly in numerous American cities and states (San Francisco, Nevada, El Paso, etc.).The drop-off between the second and third most-spoken languages in the U.S. is steep, but Chinese speakers still make up an impressively large sliver of the population. Just like large numbers of native-born Americans, many Chinese immigrants flocked to California in the 19th century hoping to win big in the state’s Gold Rush. Their legacy can still be seen in the large and vibrant Chinese-American communities, or “Chinatowns, in cities across the country. New York City hosts the largest population of ethnic Chinese outside of Asia, and there are 12 Chinatowns in the New York metro area. Thanks to the Gold Rush, San Francisco is home to the oldest American Chinatown. The vast majority of Chinese speakers in the U.S. reside in California, followed by New York, with Texas a distant third.French is only the fourth most-spoken language in the U.S. if you include Louisiana Creole French, which is a hybrid of French and African languages. This is a particularly interesting subset of American culture, with roots dating back to the 17th century. France controlled the Louisiana territory starting in 1699, and French settlers brought over their language and culture. The region was a rich mix of cultures and classes, comprised of French and Spanish settlers, Native Americans, slaves and freed slaves. After the Louisiana Purchase by the U.S. in 1803, the importation of African slaves skyrocketed, driving the influence of West African languages on the regional French. That’s when Louisiana Creole emerged, and it’s still spoken today in southern Louisiana (especially New Orleans).Today, more Americans speak standard French than Louisiana Creole (just over 700,000 people speak French Creole in the U.S. as opposed to 1.3 million who speak standard French). And French influence can be seen in numerous American English words and phrases. When you eat an omelette, change the decor of your home, or go to the ballet, you’re seamlessly blending French into your everyday life.Despite being widely spoken across the United States, Tagalog has less name recognition than the other languages on this list. For those who’ve never heard of it, it’s widely spoken in the Philippines, and its standardized version – Filipino – is one of the country’s official languages.43% of Filipinos in America live in California, but a relatively large concentration reside in Hawaii and the New York City metropolitan area as well. The Philippines was annexed by the U.S. in 1899, so Filipinos were considered American nationals, making immigration a less painful process. Many Filipinos came to the U.S. in the early 20th century to work as agricultural laborers in Hawaii and California. Another large wave of Filipino immigrants came between 1960 and 2013 for a number of reasons, including economic and educational opportunities as well as a culture of migration encouraged by the Philippine government.The number of Vietnamese speakers in the U.S. is only slightly lower than the number of Tagalog speakers. More than 300,000 Vietnamese immigrants arrived in the U.S. between 2000 and 2014, primarily to reunite with family members — many of whom sought asylum in the U.S. following the Vietnam War.The majority of Vietnamese settled in California (39%), followed by Texas (13%). In fact, the populations were so concentrated that between 2010 and 2014, one in three Vietnamese immigrants lived in the Los Angeles, San Jose or Houston metro areas.This list barely scratches the surface of the vast ocean of languages spoken natively across America, but these languages and the people who speak them have influenced the country geographically, culturally and linguistically — and the “beautiful mosaic of the U.S. continues to grow.

Serious bias, Trump said in a Nov. 27 tweet.It was the last in a series of 13 tweets in which Trump, without evidence, claimed millions of people across the nation voted illegally on Nov. 8, robbing him of a plurality of popular votes - even though he won the crucial majority of Electoral College votes.

In other words, she got about 210,000 more votes than Trump.We emailed Trump’s campaign and his transition team to learn the basis of his fraud claim but did not get a response.As news of Trump’s comments swirled, the Virginia Department of Elections issued a prepared statement from Commissioner Edgardo Cortes batting down the president-elect’s statement.The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded, Cortes said. Virginia's election was well administered by our 133 professional local registrars, with help from hundreds of election officials and volunteers who worked to guarantee a good experience for eligible Virginia voters. The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted.Martin Mash, a policy adviser for the Department of Elections, told us in an email that the department has not received any specific allegations of vote fraud during the Nov. 8 election. Vote-fraud allegations would be forwarded to law-enforcement officials, he said. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, said in an email that his office has not received any reports of illegal voting in this election.We contacted John Fredericks, who was chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign. He said on Election Day that officials from from Trump’s campaign and the state GOP set up a call center in Richmond to take reports of voting irregularities. Although the center received hundreds of calls, nothing caused great concern, he said.Fredericks told us he is not aware of any massive voter fraud on Election Day beyond many isolated incidents of people voting without having proper identification who wanted provisional ballots.Fredericks added that flaws in the state’s election system allow avenues for illegitimate ballots and that there are real examples of real potential voter fraud or the groundwork for voting fraud being laid.For example, Fredericks pointed to a well-publicized case from Harrisonburg where 18 to 20 people who died ended up on voter rolls. The FBI is probing that case of potential voter fraud. But it should be noted that that this irregularity was discovered in September - well in advance of Election Day.Another case being prosecuted in Alexandria involves what appears to be a relatively small number of fake voter registration applications, and it was also found before Election Day, the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an article this week.We also emailed the Republican Party of Virginia for its take on Trump’s serious voter fraud claim.

John Fredericks, a conservative radio talk-show host who chaired Trump’s Virginia campaign, said there were “isolated incidents,” such as the roughly 20 dead people registered to vote in Harrisonburg. “I was not made aware of any voter fraud in Virginia on a mass scale,” Fredericks said in an interview. “That doesn’t mean that there isn’t any.” Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who supported Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, laughed off Trump’s claim while speaking to reporters. “When you make an allegation, put proof behind it,” McAuliffe said.

His commission is going there.,"New Hampshire is known for hosting the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. But now, another reputation is gaining steam: as a breeding ground for vote fraud.The state was one of the first targets of Donald Trump’s claims of illegal voting during the 2016 election — he lost the state by a razor-thin margin (fewer than 2,800 votes). Weeks after he defeated Hillary Clinton, Trump claimed without evidence that the state had serious voter fraud and charged that thousands of people from Massachusetts were bused into in the Granite State to vote.Trump's vote fraud panel is coming to New Hampshire on Tuesday for its second public meeting, only days after the commission's vice chairman amplified in an op-ed the president's baseless claims that illegal voting had possibly swayed the election in the state.It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes, the vice chairman, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, wrote on Breitbart last week.He added that it is possible that New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents.Experts countered that there's no evidence of significant fraud.New Hampshire is central to President Trump’s first claim of widespread voter fraud, said Jonathan Brater, counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which examines voting rights issues.“There’s really no evidence of widespread fraud in New Hampshire, but that has not stopped some people from inflating the potential for voter fraud,” he added.The accusation that people have been bused in from nearby states has been around since at least the mid-1990s, said the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Ray Buckley.This is a lie that they have convinced themselves because they have not been able to process that Democrats win in New Hampshire,” Buckley told NBC News. You would think after 20 years of saying it, if it was true, that one of them would have taken a picture of one of the buses. It’s a farce.In the op-ed, Kobach cited driver's license and voter registration data released last week at the request of New Hampshire's Republican House speaker, Shawn Jasper.The data showed that over 6,500 people who voted in last year’s election had out-of-state licenses, which experts said is no evidence of voter fraud. State law allows people with non-New Hampshire driver's licenses to live in the state and vote legally.These are people who had licenses from other states as millions of people do. They might be students and they might be military, David Becker, an election expert, and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said in a statement. There can be no conclusions drawn regarding the driver's licenses.New Hampshire State Rep. Fred Doucette, a Trump supporter, told a local television station that he personally witnessed people exiting cars with Massachusetts license plates and voting at local polling stations during the presidential election.In recent years, the state has passed laws that critics say amount to voter suppression, but advocates argue will tamp down on any improper voting, including a voter ID law and a residency law requiring voters to prove where they live.It’s interesting that they (the vote fraud commission) are visiting a place where President Trump has said that there’s widespread illegal voting, said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who opposed Trump during the 2016 election.I think the state is being used, he added. They have already concluded what they plan to conclude, and these are just show trials that they’re having.New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a Democrat and a member of the vote fraud commission, has repeatedly denied claims of widespread voter fraud in the state.Gardner told a local paper this year, I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-claims-vote-fraud-new-hampshire-his-commission-going-there-n799931,

Yes. Massive? Doubtful.,"RICHMOND – For years, Republicans have loudly proclaimed that voter fraud is widespread in U.S. elections – and just as adamantly, Democrats have insisted that such allegations are nonsense.  Last fall, a pair of groups supported by conservatives released a report with the sensational title “Alien Invasion in Virginia: The discovery and coverup of noncitizen registration and voting.” It said illegal voting is a “massive problem"":  “In our small sample of just eight Virginia counties who responded to our public inspection requests, we found 1046 aliens who registered to vote illegally,” the study said.  “The problem is most certainly exponentially worse because we have no data regarding aliens on the registration rolls for the other 125 Virginia localities. Even in this small sample, when the voting history of this small sample of alien registrants is examined, nearly 200 verified ballots were cast before they were removed from the rolls. Each one of them is likely a felony.”  The report’s startling claims gained traction on some conservative websites as evidence of a rigged election system but were dismissed by Democrats as fiction from the far-right. The study made a splash in Virginia media but was quickly lost in the partisan noise of the presidential election.  In recent weeks, Capital News Service attempted to replicate the study’s methods and found that some noncitizens have indeed voted in Virginia, though not on a massive scale. Using the Freedom of Information Act, voter registration records and voter history data, CNS found that:      About 240 people who weren’t citizens had been registered to vote in 10 localities, mostly in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area.     28 of these noncitizens actually voted in an election before they were removed from the voter registration rolls.     They cast a total of more than 100 ballots.  CNS did not find evidence that noncitizens voted in massive numbers or tipped an election, as some Republicans have alleged. Indeed, half of the noncitizens who voted in a party primary voted in a Republican primary. However, the records seem to contradict Democrats’ assertion that voter fraud is nonexistent.  Origins of the ‘Alien Invasion’ report  The “Alien Invasion” study was produced by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit law firm based in Indiana, and the Virginia Voter Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group “dedicated to free and fair elections.”  Logan Churchwell is the foundation’s communications director and founding editor of Breitbart News Texas, a division of the far-right news network. In an email, Churchwell explained the process the foundation used in its study to determine whether noncitizens had voted.  Citing the state’s Freedom of Information Act, the foundation requested documents on people who were registered to vote but later pulled off the voter rolls after officials discovered they were not citizens.  “Once we knew that more than 1,000 voters fit this description, and knew their names, we were able to see in voter files that roughly 200 ballots had been cast from this sample,” Churchwell said.  He believes that is just the tip of the iceberg, since the study covered only a handful of Virginia’s 133 counties and cities.  “After our first survey of 10 jurisdictions, we’re now sweeping statewide,” Churchwell said. “We’re finding more voter registrations that were swept under the rug without calling the cops. We’ll be releasing an update to our study this year.”  To replicate the investigation, CNS sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the 10 localities mentioned in the foundation’s report: the counties of Prince William, Loudoun, Stafford, Bedford, Hanover, Fairfax and Chesterfield and the cities of Alexandria, Roanoke and Manassas.  The requests asked for the names of individuals who were taken off the voter registration rolls since 2015 after it was determined that they were not citizens.  The FOIA requests yielded names and other information on 243 individuals who were removed from the voter rolls because their citizenship had been questioned. Four of them were later reinstated, resulting in a final list of 239 noncitizens who had been registered voters.  But did these individuals actually vote? The answer lies in the state’s voter history database, which shows whether someone has cast a ballot in a particular election.  Reporters do not have access to that database. However, it is available to political campaigns and groups. One such group is NGP VAN, which manages data for Democrats. CNS asked the organization to look up the voter histories of the individuals who had been dropped from Virginia’s voter rolls for not being citizens.  Of the 239 individuals, the voter history database indicated that 28 had voted in an election. In fact, 26 of them voted in last year’s general election.  For about half of these individuals, 2016 was the only election they voted in. But others had been voting for years – including one with a voting history back to 1996. In all, the 28 noncitizens were recorded as having cast a total of 120 ballots.  The CNS research did not corroborate the contention in the “Alien Invasion” report that “nearly 200 verified ballots” were cast by noncitizens before they were removed from the voter rolls. However, it seemed certain that some noncitizens have voted.  Can a noncitizen accidentally register to vote?  It’s possible for noncitizens to get on the voter registration roll by mistake. It can happen when they go to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles to get a driver’s license or register an automobile.  Under the federally mandated “motor voter” system, people who go to DMV have an opportunity to register to vote. They receive a form with two checkoff questions:      “Are you a citizen of the United States?”     “Will you be 18 years of age on or before the next General Election day?”  People who answer “yes” to either question and fill out of the rest of the form will automatically have their name put on the voter rolls. Forms obtained by CNS show that some people who checked the “no” box on the citizenship question but completed the remainder of the form were added to the voter registration rolls.  “When it comes to registration, it’s mostly an honor system whether it’s at the DMV or not,” said Edgardo Cortés, commissioner for the Virginia Department of Elections. “There is no comprehensive list of U.S. citizens that is available anywhere.”  Thus, getting on the voter registration rolls is fairly easy. If election officials later learn that someone’s citizenship is in question, they send the person a written warning. The individual then has 14 days to verify his or her citizenship.  Cortés said law enforcement and other government agencies keep in close touch with the Virginia Department of Elections.

In a June 28 letter, Kris Kobach, vice chair of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, asked for names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security information, voting history and military status, among other information.The letter did not explain what the commission will do with the information, but asked states to deliver the data by July 14 and said everything would be made available to the public.California’s Secretary of State Alex Padilla called the election commission a “waste of taxpayer money.” Trump created the commission after claiming — with no evidence — that millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 presidential election.“I will not provide sensitive voter information to a commission that has already inaccurately passed judgment that millions of Californians voted illegally. California’s participation would only serve to legitimize the false and already debunked claims of massive voter fraud made by the President, the Vice President, and Mr. Kobach,” Padilla said in his statement. “The President’s Commission is a waste of taxpayer money and a distraction from the real threats to the integrity of our elections today: aging voting systems and documented Russian interference in our elections.”New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a tweet that his state would also deny the request, and that New York “refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election.”The Democratic governor stressed that there is no evidence of voter fraud in Virginia and added that the only issue he saw in 2016 was the evidence of Russian interference, which is still being investigated.“This entire commission is based on the specious and false notion that there was widespread voter fraud last November. At best this commission was set up as a pretext to validate Donald Trump’s alternative election facts, and at worst is a tool to commit large-scale voter suppression,” McAuliffe’s statement said.Kobach, who is also the Kansas Secretary of State, has a history of being concerned about voter fraud, according to the Kansas City Star. He has championed some of the strictest voting laws in the country, and has been accused of exaggerating fraud in the past.He told the Star on Thursday that criticism of his letter requesting voter data was “complete nonsense.”",http://time.com/4840695/trump-voter-fraud-commission-personal-data/,

On Sunday, Nov. 27, President-elect Donald Trump said on Twitter serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. On Monday the New Hampshire Attorney General's office said it doesn't have evidence to back up that claim (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)A Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission isn’t going to let President Donald Trump go without providing evidence that there was voter fraud during the 2016 presidential election in New Hampshire.In yet another letter to Trump, FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub is asking Trump to provide proof of his claim that thousands of Democratic Massachusetts residents were bused to the Granite State on election day to illegally vote against him.“This allegation of a vast conspiracy, involving thousands of people committing felony criminal acts aimed at stealing the election, has deeply disturbed citizens throughout America,” she wrote in a Wednesday letter. “I have heard from many of them, including proud and patriotic New Englanders who are shocked by the allegation and feel that it impugns their historic role in our democracy.”She also called on Trump in February to provide evidence for his voter fraud claim.This latest letter adds fuel to the fire of what’s already been a heated debate between Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire when it comes to the state’s election laws. In fact, the Senate is close to voting on a major bill that would close several of the state’s voting law loopholes, according to Republicans.The legend of Massachusetts voters busing into the Granite State to cast a ballot in our elections is not a new tale, but here’s a quick timeline of events that led to this sweeping legislation:Yet, it didn’t stop there. Trump kept talking about voter fraud even after his presidential inauguration.Many Republicans and Democrats are upset that Trump is pushing a false narrative and is making people question the integrity of the democratic voting process. However, his statement perfectly illustrates what his supporters and several Republicans believe is the problem with election laws in New Hampshire: The current laws make it difficult to charge anyone with voter fraud because what’s legal here is usually illegal in another state.Hence, Senate Bill 3, which was introduced by Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, to address a lot of those concerns. Of course, the bill is divided on party lines — it’s cheered by Republicans who say they are trying to tighten the process and ensure that those who vote in New Hampshire actually live in New Hampshire and criticized by Democrats who say the bill is a form of voter suppression.One of the issues it focuses on is the definition of domicile, which varies from state to state, and the New Hampshire Legislature is trying to better define the difference between “domicile” and “residence” in this bill. Under current laws, the definition of domicile is “that place, to which upon temporary absence, a person has the intention of returning.” Republicans think that’s vague and allows campaign workers, who might be in the state for a month or so, to vote in New Hampshire, even if they plan on leaving after the election.An incident occurred in the 2008 and 2012 elections when Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, allowed Democratic staffers to live at her home. The staffers used her address to vote in the election, and since they were living in the state for at least three months before the election, the Attorney General ruled that it was legal.Under the new bill, a person who registers to vote within 30 days of an election or on Election Day must show verification that a New Hampshire address is his or her domicile. That can be done by showing proof of residency at a college or university, driver’s license, utility bill, among other forms. Those who do not show documentation can still register and vote by filling out a domicile affidavit and registration form, and provide the documentation within 10 or 30 days of Election Day, depending on the community. Someone could get charged with voter fraud if they fail to provide a document verifying his or her domicile within that window.A previous version of the bill called for police officer to knock on doors to verify a voter’s domicile, but that provision was taken out this week. The bill still allows municipal officials to visit those addresses or ask “agents” to do so.The Senate Election Law Committee recommended Tuesday in favor of the bill by a 3-2 vote on party lines and it now heads to the full Senate for a vote.Adding to the controversy, the Attorney General’s office recently said investigations into thousands of affidavit voters who cast ballots in New Hampshire without identification during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles have been dropped due to the lack of manpower and money to complete the investigations.How can the Attorney General and Secretary of State’s office say there is no evidence of voter fraud if they aren’t investigating every potential violation? That’s what Republicans are asking.Sununu’s budget didn’t fulfill the attorney general’s request for roughly $93,000 annually to hire a full-time elections investigator. A Senate bill would provide about $500,000 to the Attorney General’s office for with focus on elections, lobbying, and campaign finance law. That bill passed the Senate and is now in the House Finance Committee.“No matter how you change it, there is not a problem in the state of New Hampshire,” said Senate Democratic Leader Jeff Woodburn. “There’s been a ruse of illegal voting, and Trump buses, and all of this business. This is nothing but a concerted national attempt to suppress voting and harass voters.”“This is not national trend legislation,” Birdsell said this week. “This is homegrown here. It is something that is trying to address what some of our constituents are looking for.”The debate on this bill, and the discussion of voter fraud in New Hampshire, is far from over.",http://www.insidesources.com/voter-fraud-new-hampshire/,

It debunks President Trump's claims that millions improperly voted in November.In 2016, for the first time, presidential politics was roiled by claims of widespread illegal voting. In the weeks after the election, the claims continued. President-elect Trump insisted, “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. On that same day, four hours later, he added, “Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California — so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias — big problem!” After his inauguration, the claims escalated. “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD,” he declared.As time passed, Trump’s claim grew more specific and more exaggerated. On Feb. 9th, he told a group of 10 Senators that ineligible persons had voted in droves, and that they had been driven in buses by the thousands from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended and reiterated the claims of voting by noncitizens. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller toured the Sunday morning news interview shows to defend the claim. The White House asserted that these claims required an investigation, to be led by Vice President Mike Pence. In a March 22nd interview with TIME, the president said that he believes he will be proven right and that he is moving forward with the investigative committee. In late April, Spicer told CNN that he expects news on the voter fraud investigation in the “next week or two,” and that Pence will still be “very involved.”Are the president’s claims plausible? The Brennan Center reached out systematically to those who would know best: the local officials who actually ran the election in 2016. These officials are in the best position to detect improper voting — by noncitizens or any other kind. To make sure we were speaking to the right individuals, this study relies on interviews with officials who ran the elections in jurisdictions (towns, cities, or counties) nationwide with the highest share of noncitizen residents, and those in states identified by Trump as the locus of supposed misconduct. We interviewed a total of 44 administrators representing 42 jurisdictions in twelve states, including officials in 8 of the 10 jurisdictions with the largest populations of noncitizens nationally.Our nationwide study of noncitizen or fraudulent voting in 2016 from the perspective of local election officials found:The absence of fraud reinforces a wide consensus among scholars, journalists and election administrators: voter fraud of any kind, including noncitizen voting, is rare.Two features of this study stand out.It is the first analysis to look at voting from the perspective of local officials in 2016 — the year that Trump claimed was marred by widespread illegal voting.Why speak with local officials? In the United States, elections are administered within local jurisdictions — counties, cities, and townships. These bodies and their officials run elections, process registration applications, and directly deal with voters. To be sure, local elections officials may not be aware of every incident of ineligible voting, and the tools at their disposal are imperfect, but they remain well-positioned to account for what is happening in the area they oversee.Second, this study casts a wider net than studies focusing on prosecutions or convictions. It identifies both those who voted improperly by mistake, and those who did so with malicious intent. We asked administrators both the number of incidents of noncitizen voting they referred for prosecution or further investigation, and the number of suspected incidents they encountered but did not refer in 2016. In all but two of 42 possible jurisdictions, the answers to both questions were zero. Some who claim widespread misconduct insist that, because prosecution is hard, there is likely a much wider pool of people who were caught voting improperly, but who simply were not prosecuted. This study finds that both the number of people referred for prosecution and the number of people merely suspected of improper voting are very small.Noncitizen Voting: The Missing Millions by The Brennan Center for Justice",https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions,

And in a sign that liberals and progressives are getting under his skin, he rebutted their frequent (and irrelevant) claim that Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote, which would somehow undermine Mr. Trump’s legitimacy.  “It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-states instead of the 15 states that I visited.

Washington correspondent Matt Laslo reports that many lawmakers from our region are dubious of the commission, and some Republicans wonder if it's a top priority.  The Vice President and other top Republican officials are investigating voter fraud. They sent a request to states for sensitive voter data, much of which can be purchased in the Commonwealth. But even many Republican governors rebuffed the request.  While the White House rescinded that request as it's challenged in the courts, Virginia Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly says it’s a sham commission to begin with. The whole premise is of course phony; made up to feed the ego of Mr. Trump who cannot accept the fact that he got elected as a minority president  “I mean talk about alternate facts and fake news. The whole premise is of course phony; made up to feed the ego of Mr. Trump who cannot accept the fact that he got elected as a minority president, losing almost three million more votes to his opponent than himself.”  Virginia Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott says the commission is aimed at voter ""suppression.""  “The purpose obviously is not to make the voting process any more secure. The first thing that they'll be sure to be looking at is hacking into voter rolls. There's public reports that Russia had gotten into the voter rolls, and that ought to be the first thing that we ought to be looking at, not some made up idea that millions of people cast illegal votes.”  Scott says the refusal to make the voting commission bipartisan is telling.  “And then if you just look at the leadership of the commission, not only is it based on a premise that makes no sense, but you have partisan leadership. You have the Vice President, a Republican, and a Republican from Kansas who is, according to reports, an active candidate for the Republican nomination for governor.”  But Virginia Republicans see things differently. Congressman Tom Garrett is a former prosecutor and says he’s debated this issue since his days in Richmond.  “There are fraudulent votes cast. I know it. It was very frustrating to stand in the Chamber of the Virginia Senate and hear people say, 'There are no voter fraud cases ever proven.' And then stand up and say, ‘No, I’ve prosecuted four accounts. Successfully.’”  Garrett says the commission’s goal is honorable, even if they made a misstep by requesting sensitive voter data.   “So we know it’s real; we don’t know the scope and scale. I do think perhaps there was an overreach as it relates to the data requested. I think legislatively we can direct the states to manage the voter rolls within the purview of the federal government constitutionally in a manner such that we can ensure cleaner rolls.”    Virginia Republican Scott Taylor says the voting commission isn’t a priority for him and many in his party. So we know it's real; we don't know the scope and scale  “I think if it’s their prerogative to try to figure out if there is in fact an issue with voter fraud in certain states, I don't see a big issue with it. I get the politics with it, that you know it's like the President wants to say that he won the damn popular vote. I don't give a s*** about that.”  But Taylor says if the commission finds voter fraud then so be it.  “If you shouldn't be voting, you shouldn't be voting, you know what I mean? So I think there's some common sense in here as well too. So if you take all of the politics out of this, I think it's important for states to protect the privacy of their citizens.”  When the commission kicked off its first meeting, its chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach cited 128 cases of alleged voter fraud found in his state to justify the effort and attention. It's slated to issue a report next year which makes it less likely any proposed changes it suggests would be in place in time to affect next year's mid-term elections.

I think he's stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign. He continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.Reporters asked Spicer why Trump wouldn't launch an investigation into voter fraud if he believed it had affected the election, to which Spicer replied, Maybe we will. Spicer said the president believed that as many as 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in November.Trump and his aides have cited a 2012 Pew study and a debunked report published in The Washington Post in 2014 to back up the false claims that voter fraud affected the election.During a rally in October, Trump cited the highly respected Pew, which he said found that there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.There are 1.8 million dead people that are registered right now to vote, Trump said. And folks, folks, some of them vote.But the author of that study, David Becker, has repeatedly pushed back against Trump's claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election.As I've noted before, voting integrity better in this election than ever before. Zero evidence of fraud, Becker tweeted on Tuesday.The president tweeted in late November: In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California — so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!Becker, the author of the Pew study, replied to Trump on Twitter: We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.Trump's transition spokesman, Jason Miller, subsequently pointed to a disputed report published by a Washington Post blog in 2014 that said 14% of noncitizens said they were registered to vote in 2008 and 2010.Trump's son Eric also cited the Washington Post report in an October interview with ABC after he was asked whether his father would accept the results of the election if he lost.My father will accept it 100% if it's fair ... 14% of all noncitizens in this country are registered to vote, Trump claimed.The authors of that study have downplayed its findings, saying that while we stand by our finding that some non-citizens have voted in recent elections, the study's findings about noncitizen voting had been exaggerated and misrepresented.One of the study's authors, Old Dominion University professor Jesse Richman, wrote a response to the use of his data by the Trump campaign, saying that on the right there has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud.The Washington Post blog was ultimately revised with an editor's note: The post occasioned three rebuttals (here, here and here) as well as a response from the authors. Subsequently, another peer-reviewed article argued that the findings reported in this post (and affiliated article) were biased and that the authors' data do not provide evidence of non-citizen voting in U.S. elections.",http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-voter-fraud-investigation-2017-1,

Trump Has No Proof and Many Skeptics,"Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Miller has produced any evidence.While election officials have unearthed isolated instances of voter fraud or people voting improperly in New Hampshire, neither the secretary of state nor the attorney general has found any evidence of fraud on the scale alleged by Mr. Trump.The Boston Globe reported that the secretary of state, William Gardner, was told on Election Day that the parking lot of a busy precinct was filled with cars with Massachusetts license plates, but when he arrived, he found that the cars belonged to people who were campaigning, not trying to vote.Mr. Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by 2,736 votes, or 0.3 percent. In the Senate race, Ms. Ayotte lost to Maggie Hassan, the governor at the time, by 743 votes, or 0.1 percent.Because he lost New Hampshire by so few votes, he could have asked for a recount. He did not do so.No. “With such a close race, it’s impossible to attribute the outcome to any one factor,” her spokesman said. Ms. Ayotte has noted that she did not ask for a recount. However, she does believe the legislature should examine its residency requirements for voting, which it is doing.Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator and a Trump supporter, told Boston Herald Radio in November that 100,000 Massachusetts residents had voted in neighboring New Hampshire that month, and that 40,000 had done so when he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New Hampshire in 2014. “People from Massachusetts could have gone up and voted that day, and quite frankly some do,” Mr. Brown said, offering no evidence. “It’s well-known, it’s no secret.”Some Republicans have long claimed that New Hampshire’s same-day registration law, which lets people register on the day of the election, has allowed nonresidents, especially college students in neighboring Massachusetts, to vote. The law requires they show valid identification at the polls.If they do not have such an ID, their picture is taken and they have to sign an oath swearing to their identity and that they are voting legally. After the election, the secretary of state sends out confirmation letters to those voters, who must respond. So far this year, the secretary of state’s office has reported no indications of widespread fraud.Lots of them have emphatically rejected the whole notion of voting fraud, even though some have questioned the state’s same-day registration rules. Steve Duprey, a former Republican state chairman and current national Republican committeeman, wrote on Twitter: “Repeating: there is no voter fraud in NH. None. Zip. Nada. Hundreds of lawyers, poll workers, watchers, press -no buses rolled in.” Thomas D. Rath, a former state attorney general, tweeted: “Allegations of voter fraud in NH are baseless, without any merit — it’s shameful to spread these fantasies.” And Fergus Cullen, a former Republican state chairman, wrote: “I will pay $1000 to 1st person proving even 1 outofstate person took bus from MA 2 any NH polling place last ElectionDay.”Before the election, Gov. Chris Sununu alleged voter fraud, saying that out-of-state Democrats were being bused in “all over the place.” Asked for evidence, he modified his claim, saying, “I don’t want to imply I see buses coming over.” PolitiFact New Hampshire said Mr. Sununu’s assertion was “ridiculous” and rated it “Pants on Fire.”But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Sununu won the state and so for obvious reasons wants to be cautious about asserting fraud. “I’m not aware of any widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire; however the administration has made some strong assertions to the contrary,” he told WMUR.com on Monday. “I take their concerns seriously and look forward to working closely with them to learn of any evidence they may have and help address any concerns that may develop from there.”Not surprisingly, top New Hampshire Democrats roundly reject the claims. “There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of major voter fraud in New Hampshire’s elections,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen. “President Trump continues to spread a dangerous lie, and it’s long past time for Republican leadership in New Hampshire to stand up and defend our state’s electoral system.” And Ms. Hassan’s spokesman, Aaron Jacobs, said the “completely unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud have been debunked by independent fact checkers time and again.”Articles debunking the claims have been posted by The Boston Globe, NPR and The Associated Press, among others.A federal election commissioner, Ellen L. Weintraub, said she was so outraged by Mr. Trump’s comments that she was moved to speak out and demand that if he has evidence of fraud, he needs to present it.“This would be a criminal conspiracy involving thousands of people,” she said. She noted that Ms. Ayotte’s race was the most expensive Senate race per capita in the country last year, and that in such a small state, widespread fraud would have been noticed. “It’s not like no one was paying attention to what was going on in New Hampshire,” she added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/voter-fraud-new-hampshire-gop.html,

Serious bias - big problem!” the Republican tweeted.The claim, which critics quickly mocked as implausible, echoed in part assertions that were made and debunked in the days before the election.Thomas D. Rath, the former New Hampshire attorney general who has opposed Trump, tweeted, “This will probably cost me my spot in the Cabinet but there was no fraud, serious or other, in this election in NH. There just wasn’t.”Rath, a Republican who served as New Hampshire primary campaign co-chairman to Ohio Governor John Kasich, did not respond to request for further comment.Trump’s media office did not immediately respond to a request Sunday night for information about what led him to allege that voter fraud had affected results in New Hampshire and the other states.His message followed a series of earlier posts on Sunday in which Trump voiced opposition to recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania proposed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and supported in Wisconsin by representatives for Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Trump also continued to claim — without providing any support — that voter fraud had been widespread in the Nov. 8 election.Midafternoon on Sunday, he tweeted, “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”No evidence has been reported of widespread voting fraud anywhere in the country.In New Hampshire, a spokesman for outgoing Governor Maggie Hassan, pushed back against Trump’s claim. Hassan, a Democrat, also won a narrow race in New Hampshire, unseating incumbent Republican US Senator Kelly Ayotte.“His tweet is completely unsubstantiated and claims of voter fraud in New Hampshire have earned Politifact’s rating of ‘Pants on Fire.’ ” said the spokesman, William Hinkle.Hinkle was referring to a report by the non-partisan fact-checking website that debunked claims by then-New Hampshire Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu, who later won the election for governor.On Oct. 31, Sununu said on Howie Carr’s WRKO radio show that Democrats had abused the state’s same-day voter registration law and bused in voters from Massachusetts, according to published reports.“We have same day voter registration, and to be honest, when Massachusetts elections are not very close, they’re busing them in all over the place,” Sununu said, according to the Concord Monitor.Sununu later walked back some of his claims.Politifact found that voter fraud had been reported in New Hampshire — but only on a small scale, and that Sununu provided no evidence that out-of-state voters had been bused into the Granite State.It quoted New Hampshire Secretary of State William M. Gardner saying there had been prosecutions for election fraud in each year since 2000 and that out-of-state residents had been caught voting there, but that fraud had not been a widespread problem.“I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,” Gardner said, according to Politifact. Gardner and two deputy secretaries of state could not be reached for comment Sunday night.On Sunday, Sununu spokesman David Abrams said he had not yet seen Trump’s tweet, but that Sununu’s “position on voter fraud and election reform is well recorded.”Abrams said that Sununu had expressed to him no concerns about voter fraud in New Hampshire in the nearly three weeks since the election.Some New Hampshire Democrats responded in outraged terms to Trump’s claim.Jeff Woodburn, a state senator, wrote on Facebook that he took “great pride in the integrity of New Hampshire’s voting process.” Woodburn said he believed Sununu’s earlier comments were the source of “President-elect Trump’s outrageous, unsubstantiated claim that New Hampshire’s election was rigged by ‘serious voter fraud.’”Colin Van Ostern, a Democratic member of New Hampshire’s Executive Council who ran unsucccessfully for governor this year, tweeted, “This false attack on NH’s elections reveals how threatened he is by the power of voters -- which he wants to restrict. Resist!”Dean Barker, a Democratic blogger in New Hampshire, wrote: “This is a real moment of truth for #NHGov-Elect Sununu. Will he knock this falsehood down or drag our state’s reputation down with it?”Barker also pointed out that the Trump campaign had the opportunity to request a recount in the state but allowed the Nov. 14 deadline to pass.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/27/trump-claims-voter-fraud-provides-evidence/bN3RQKWeRy625Jqa1OqCdL/story.html,

Kelly Ayotte the state in the November election.Trump made the comments in a private meeting with Ayotte and a group of senators that was meant to be a bipartisan discussion to build support for Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court.According to a source briefed on the discussion, Trump told Ayotte that she would have won re-election had she not been critical of him during the course of the campaign. He then alluded to thousands of people who supposedly went into New Hampshire illegally to vote against both him and Ayotte, saying they both would have won “if there hadn’t been voter fraud” in the state. The source called the exchange “uncomfortable.” It was first reported by Politico and independently confirmed by The Huffington Post.Though he’s been president now for three weeks, Trump remains preoccupied with the idea that he was robbed of a win in the popular vote. He has mentioned it with senators before, and his spokesperson, Sean Spicer, has confirmed it is a genuine belief of his. There is no evidence at all to support the claim, as confirmed by state authorities across the nation.“I can say that the number of election related matters coming out of the general election is relatively ordinary and does not indicate a widespread scheme to bring thousands of voters from out of state,” Brian Buonamano, an assistant attorney general in New Hampshire, said in an email. “We have no evidence or indication that there existed a scheme to bus in thousands of people to illegally vote in NH.”Trump has claimed voter fraud in New Hampshire before. In November, weeks after his electoral victory, he tweeted that there was “serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.”Though they lack validity, Trump’s claims are still harmful. They stoke distrust in the nation’s political system and provide lawmakers with a basis ― however specious ― for taking steps to make it harder for people to vote.In New Hampshire, for example, Republicans are considering at least 10 measures that would make voting more difficult. Several of those measures address residency requirements and would present new roadblocks to people who don’t intend to live in the state permanently. Such a change would have a major effect on college students, whose votes helped deliver New Hampshire for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent. He continued, 5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.We previously rated False a claim by Trump that our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. So if 18 to 20 percent is false, how does 42 percent rate? We took a closer look.We’ll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work.This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements.We asked the Trump campaign for a source of the 42 percent figure, but they didn’t respond. The Fact Checker, however, traced it back to a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director.Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a plausible measure of the potential workforce. If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you run the numbers, the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent, Stockman wrote.Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers, he wrote. We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.Stockman’s calculation treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement, said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all.In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.Taking another whack at the numbersAll of this spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It’s within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor underutilization called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially unemployed and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are marginally attached to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump’s 42 percent.We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here’s a summary.In other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early).If you turn this into a new type of unemployment rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it’s only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being out of work can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits, he said.This isn't the first time Trump has used the 42 percent number. In August, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the column’s harshest rating for truthfulness. Trump then repeated it in his tax-plan press conference.Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.CORRECTION, Feb. 11, 2016: We've updated this story to reflect some changes to the statistics for students listed in the table.

The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he’d made several times before.Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment, Trump said. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.Actually, Trump’s the one who shouldn’t be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate.To understand why, let’s start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008.Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren’t looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don’t feel they have a shot in the current job market.To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls labor underutilization. This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand U-6.The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially unemployed and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are marginally attached to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that’s also its lowest level since May 2008.It’s possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument.But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the real unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent.Why? He’s including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let’s explore this point further.The source of Trump’s 42 percent figure appears to be a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director.Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a plausible measure of the potential workforce. If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you run the numbers, the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent, Stockman wrote.Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers, he wrote. We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.Stockman’s calculation treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement, said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all.In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no.To see why, let’s start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million non-working Americans.We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work.• People age 16 to 19 who are not in the labor force: Subtract 10.8 million• People age 65 and up who are not in the labor force: Subtract 38.4 millionSo what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working.If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of unemployment rate -- call it U-7 if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it’s only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.This isn’t a perfect calculation. There’s probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren’t working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn’t get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65.Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump’s claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent.There’s even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being out of work by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term jobless, he said, is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits.Trump said, Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That’s far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent.

Donald Trump Has a Point, Sort Of","So what’s in that 4.9 percent “official” unemployment rate? The numerator is Americans who are unemployed, the people who told a survey taker that they do not have a job but want one and have actively sought a job in the last four weeks. There were 7.8 million people in that category in January. The denominator is the total labor force, meaning people who either have a job or are looking for one; there were 158 million of those people.It’s easy to see how you can get to a much larger unemployment rate if you change your definition for either of those numbers. Take the B.L.S.’s broadest definition of unemployment for example, known as U-6.U-6 includes not just those 7.8 million people who have actively sought work in the last four weeks, but also millions more who told a survey taker that they wanted a job and had looked for one in the last year, including those who say they’re discouraged by economic conditions, along with people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. That measure of unemployment was 9.9 percent in January (or 10.5 percent if you want to cast aside the “seasonal adjustment” process that smooths out normal seasonal variation).But we don’t have to restrict ourselves to the calculations that B.L.S. has done for us. With a little creativity we can come up with other definitions of unemployment that yield an even higher number.There are, after all, many millions of Americans who are of prime working age who are not working, not looking for a job, haven’t looked for a job in the last year and yet in a healthier economy may well prefer to work.At the high point, in 1999, 84.6 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were working; now that is down to 81.1 percent. If we returned to the 1999 level, that would mean an additional 4.4 million working Americans. If we count those people — the missing workers — as unemployed, and tack them on to the definitions of unemployment included in U-6, we suddenly get to 20.1 million unemployed people and a 12.3 percent unemployment rate.But back to Mr. Trump’s assertion that the true unemployment rate is more like 28 or 35 or 42 percent. Is there any plausible way to come up with a jobless rate at those kinds of levels?As it happens, there is, and it’s right there near the top of the monthly jobless report. Only 59.6 percent of the United States population was employed in January. On the other side of that, a whopping 40.4 percent of the population is not employed.If that is your definition of unemployed, well, yeah, the United States does have 40 percent unemployment. But keep in mind that this counts as unemployed every retiree, every college student, everyone who is unable to work because of a disability and every parent who voluntarily stays at home to raise a child.But surely we can find a way to make the unemployment rate seem higher still, right?I did some back-of-the-envelope math and came up with a way to get a jobless rate of about 53 percent! Instead of just including people 16 and above, the way the B.L.S. does, we could throw in those good-for-nothing children who are neither working, looking for work nor counted as part of the labor force.Like my 2-year-old niece, Lilia, who if you ask me has had it too easy for too long.

Forecasters expect little change in the jobless rate, which was 4.7 percent in December. That's down from 10 percent during the depths of the recession in late 2009.Trump repeatedly claimed during the campaign that the federal government was understating the real unemployment rate.Don't believe these phony numbers, Trump told supporters early last year. The number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35 [percent]. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, echoed that sentiment during his confirmation hearing.The unemployment rate is not real, Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee. I've traveled for the last year. I've seen this.The Labor Department actually publishes a variety of unemployment statistics, though none comes close to the figures Trump cited. The headline number of 4.7 percent counts only those who have actively looked for work in last four weeks.A broader measure of unemployment counts anyone who has looked unsuccessfully for work in the last year. That figure was 5.7 percent in December. Adding in part-time workers who would prefer to work full-time brings the figure to 9.2 percent — the government's most comprehensive measure of unemployment and under-employment.None of these jobless measures counts people who have dropped out of the labor force altogether. The labor force participation rate — currently 62.7 percent — has fallen 3 percentage points since former President Obama took office eight years ago. Some of that decline is a result of demographic trends, as aging baby boomers retire voluntarily. The drop may also reflect lingering fallout from the Great Recession.If you counted everyone who's not in the labor force as unemployed, you would get a jobless rate of 37.3 percent. But that's obviously inflated, as it includes retirees, college students and voluntary stay-at-home parents.Stronger wage growth might pull more people back into the labor force, and more family-friendly policies might encourage stay-at-home parents to return to work. The aging population, however, will continue to put downward pressure on workforce participation. That will make it difficult for the new president to achieve his goal of adding 25 million jobs over the next decade. For comparison, the country added 15.5 million jobs under President Obama from the trough of the recession in early 2010. Today, the economy is closer to full employment, so there's much less slack to take up.The jobs report coming out next Friday reflects employment and unemployment around Jan. 12, so this is really the final assessment of the Obama administration's job record.White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a press conference he doesn't expect Trump to give the new report much attention:He's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether the American people are doing better as a whole.",https://www.npr.org/2017/01/29/511493685/ahead-of-trumps-first-jobs-report-a-look-at-his-remarks-on-the-numbers,

Rather, he wants what we all use as the official unemployment rate--not that there exists something called the official rate--to be something which more closely reflects the reality out there. And no, this isn't going to lead to us all shouting that unemployment is now 42% of whatever, that's the number of people without jobs, not the number of people who are unemployed.OK, so, maybe, as Trump has said before, you could say that people without jobs are unemployed. But that's not the distinction that economists do normally use. Rather, we do generally say that if people have sufficient income that they don't need to work then well ain't that just great? And the people who are in that situation range from those who are actually wealthy through stay at home Moms (and, these days, Pops), students and those who would rather be freezing at some demonstration in the Dakotas rather than doing an honest day's labour. Don't forget that, to an economist work is a cost, jobs are a cost. Our aim is to create a society in which as many people as possible can get to do whatever they want with their lives. We're attempting to increase utility. And if that's raising the kids or getting sprayed with cold water by the Corps of Engineers then so be it, live your life your way.Unemployed thus becomes those who would like to have a job but don't have one. At which point the American numbers become a little complex. It's easier in countries which pay unemployment insurance indefinitely because people won't drop off the lists of people unemployed. The US pays, generally, only for 26 weeks and after that, well, it gets a little difficult. We can go ask people whether they've looked for a job in the past four weeks (one definition), we can ask if they'd like a job but they haven't looked because they don't think there are any (another definition) and so on. None of these is actually correct. None are actually wrong either. They're just slightly different definitions of what is unemployment.Trump himself seems inclined to go as big as possible—he at least once suggested that the real unemployment rate could be as high as 42 percent, because there were more than 93 million adults without a job (it's now up to 95 million). Implicitly, he's arguing that we should use the overall employment-to-population ratio as our labor market barometer. That doesn't make a lot of sense. The raw employment rate is bound to decline as more Americans age into retirement, and there's really no point in treating grandmothers living out their golden years in Boca as if they're among the unemployed.That's not actually the suggestion which is being made though despite the shouting it caused when used on the campaign trail:Within the constraints of the definition of course it is real. But that definition might be telling us less than we think if there has been a structural change in how employment works these days. And it's entirely possible that there has been. The actual suggestion looks fair enough to be honest:The Labor Department releases numbers on national unemployment every month, most recently stating that the official rate was 4.7 percent. Most news stories echoed that figure, but it was actually only one of six calculations the department releases each month, each using a slightly different definition of unemployed. The numbers are collectively known as U-1 through U-6. The official rate, known as U-3, calculates people who are out of work and actively looking for a new job. Critics have said that is too narrow of a definition because it doesn't include the people who are not actively looking for jobs but who might if they thought that there were opportunities available. The department does calculate that in a number called U-5. Another figure, called U-6, includes those people and the underemployed — people who technically have jobs but are not getting full-time hours or wages. Currently, the U-5 unemployment rate is 5.7 percent, while the U-6 rate is 9.2 percent.But here's the important point about this. All of these 6 different numbers are calculated by the same people, from the same raw data, each month and released in the same press release. We already have all of these numbers that is. And they're all official unemployment numbers too. It's very much the same as the inflation rate, there is no such thing. We can talk about the consumer price index, the retail price index (not used much in the US) the CPI for urban consumers, the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE, what the Fed actually uses looking at interest rates) and we can have core (without food and energy) or regular versions of them all. All of them are, within their definitions, entirely valid measures of inflation. The Fed actually uses Core PCE while things like inflation upgrades to social security use a version of the CPI. Ho hum, as long as we know what the differences are there's no great harm.And so it is with this unemployment rate. Really all that is likely to change is how it is presented in the press and information release. Everyone who uses these things to actually decide upon policy already knows the different between U 1 and U 6 and the rest and has been using the correct one for their purposes all along--as they will continue to do.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/01/29/donald-trump-wants-to-increase-the-unemployment-rate-by-1-from-4-7-to-5-7/,

Everybody that quits looking for a job is considered statistically a person that has a job. It’s a phony number. You probably — real numbers like 22, 23 percent. In fact, if you look at crowds like this and crowds wherever I go, if we were really at five percent, 5.2 percent, nobody would be there.”“You have 60, 70, 80 million people out there that want to work that aren’t getting jobs.”For a supposedly successful businessman, Donald Trump has remarkably little understanding of employment statistics. In fact, he often utters contradictory “facts” depending on the venue. At Liberty University, he said that the real unemployment rate is “22-23 percent,” but in the past he has asserted it was as high as 42 percent.Let’s take a closer look at how Trump keeps getting these numbers wrong.The most commonly-reported unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is officially known as the “U-3” rate. This is one of six different “labor utilization” rates issued every month by the agency. The U-3 rate reflects people who are actively seeking jobs but cannot find one. As of December, that was 5.0 percent of the labor force above the age of 16.The estimate of unemployment is based on a monthly sample survey of 60,000 households. The BLS did not come up with this definition of unemployment willy-nilly; it actually reflects an internationally-embraced definition set by the International Labour Organization — that the “unemployed” are people who are not working but have actively searched for work, are available to work and are willing and able to work for pay.While Trump claims that people who quit searching for a job are counted as having one, in reality they are simply not counted as being unemployed in the the U-3 rate. But the BLS has other measures that do count those people as unemployed.For instance, there are people who are considered “marginally attached to the labor force.” These are workers who are not looking for work, but would like a job; they may, for instance, be discouraged by the lack of apparent opportunities. If you add in those possible workers, you end up with what is known as the U-5 rate. That was 6.1 percent in December.Finally, the BLS produces a rate that include people who are employed part-time — but  want and are available for full-time work. This “U-6” employment rate is 9.9 percent.Some economists might argue that the U-6 rate provides a more accurate picture of the unemployment rate, and we wouldn’t necessarily dispute that. But one generally shouldn’t fixate on month-by-month swings in a particular unemployment rate and instead should look at how it has performed over time.Here’s the U-3 rate since 1970. You can see that 5 percent is pretty close to the lowest it has been over the past 45 years — 3.9 percent.The survey questions for the U-6 were revised in 1994 and so the data only goes back 21 years. But again, you can see that the trend line even for this higher rate has dramatically improved in recent years, though it still has room for improvement to hit a previous low of 7.0 percent.In other words, the employment picture now is relatively good. The U-6 rate is even under 10 percent.So why does Trump claim 23 percent? We have no idea, since as usual his campaign refused to explain his reasoning. But a clue might stem from his comments on “Meet the Press” — that “you have 60, 70, 80 million people out there that want to work that aren’t getting jobs.”That’s a big range of 20 million people. But it’s a bit of pullback for Trump, who a few months ago asserted that there were 93 million people out of work, or 42 percent unemployment.  He appeared to be referring to the labor force participation rate, but that 93 million number (as of December, 94 million) mainly reflects the number of people who have chosen not to work, such as retirees, students and stay-at-home parents.  (After all, 10,000 baby boomers retire every day.) Only a small portion of that number includes the officially unemployed, the discouraged workers and so forth.Still, if you take 60 million as a percentage of the entire civilian noninstitutional population, you end up with 23 percent. But only about 25 million are really unemployed, or discouraged from looking for work or marginally attached to the labor force. There’s another 35 million “unemployed” who Trump has not accounted for.John Williams, an economic gadfly who runs a website called shadowstats, has argued that the rate is 22.9 percent — and has barely budged since 2011 — because, he argues, millions of Americans have simply given up looking for work and thus are not counted in the official statistics. That’s a distinctly minority point of view.Trump’s claims on the unemployment rate would not pass muster in an Economics 101 course. While he has apparently cut his estimate of the unemployment rate from 42 percent to 23 percent, his figure is still more than double the most expansive rate published by the government.

Is He Right?,"At his New Hampshire victory speech on Tuesday night, Donald Trump blasted the Obama administration’s triumphant claim that the unemployment stands at just 4.9%.“Don’t believe these phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,” Trump told his audience. “The number’s probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.”Is he right? Could unemployment really be as high as 42%?To answer this question we have to look at how the Bureau of Labor (BLS) statistics measures unemployment.Surprisingly, the bureau actually releases multiple numbers, reporting six different unemployment rates. The press only broadcasts one of those numbers, called the U-3.“The unemployment rate that is widely reported in the press on the first Friday of every month isn’t some manna from heaven, but rather a convention that has developed over the years that gives a partial — but still useful — view of the state of the labor market,” reports The New York Times.Calculating unemployment is far from a simple feat. While the number the press uses may be useful in some ways, it hardly provides a clear picture of the labor market. In fact, it may often be a functionally-meaningless figure with little operative value beyond political sophistry. The Times explains:So what’s in that 4.9 percent “official” unemployment rate? The numerator is Americans who are unemployed, the people who told a survey taker that they do not have a job but want one and have actively sought a job in the last four weeks. There were 7.8 million people in that category in January. The denominator is the total labor force, meaning people who either have a job or are looking for one; there were 158 million of those people.By simply changing the definition of “unemployment” we can arrive at much higher and perhaps more accurate figures. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' broadest definition, found in its U-6 filing, the unemployment rate actually doubles. That’s because the U-6 takes into account those have who have looked for a job in the last year, as opposed to just the past month as the U-3 does. In addition, Americans who are working part-time but prefer full-time employment are accounted for here.Even then, the BLS may be working with a narrowly-defined “unemployment” rate that fails to accurately reflect the state of the economy.The BLS numbers, all six of them, overlook the millions of Americans who haven’t looked for a job in the last year. These folks may be resigned to their fate or disillusioned by perilous economic conditions. Theoretically, they would be actively searching for employment in a more prosperous and opportune economy.Here’s how The New York Times calculates a potential unemployment rate of over 12%:At the high point, in 1999, 84.6 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were working; now that is down to 81.1 percent. If we returned to the 1999 level, that would mean an additional 4.4 million working Americans. If we count those people — the missing workers — as unemployed, and tack them on to the definitions of unemployment included in U-6, we suddenly get to 20.1 million unemployed people and a 12.3 percent unemployment rate.And yet, Trump’s staggering 42% number still seems awfully far-fetched. While, there is a plausible, albeit obtuse, way of deriving a figure close to 42% unemployment, it’s clear that Trump may have just been, well, acting like Trump, using hyperbole and rhetorical flourishes to dazzle his audience.Here's how we can technically inflate the number that high: By expanding the definition of “unemployment” to include every working-age adult in the United States who isn’t working, including retirees, college students, and the disabled, then we’d arrive at 40.2% unemployment rate (given that a total of 59.6% of the population was employed, according to the January BLS report).Trump’s figure is perhaps as unreliable as the BLS numbers. As the election season reaches a fever pitch, expect both the Obama administration and the pitchfork populist agitators clawing for the White House, including Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, to continue to contract and expand the definition “unemployment” for political expedience.",http://www.dailywire.com/news/3324/trump-says-real-unemployment-rate-42-he-right-joshua-yasmeh,

So when The Donald called into CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday and claimed that Americans are living in a “false economy,” where the unemployment rate is actually 40% rather than the 5.1% as reported by the Labor Department, you’d be forgiven for believing this was just another Trumpian whopper.But actually, this view can be supported by actual statistics. If you use the broadest definition of unemployment, the ratio of people over the age of 16 with jobs to the overall 16-and-over population, the Labor Department says that 40.6% of the population is unemployed.Unfortunately, the veracity of Trump’s analysis ends there. As you can see from the above chart, 40% of the 16-and-over population not having a job is nothing new in America. Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, presumably refers to his hope of returning America to it’s post-war glory, when the U.S. economy accounted for a much larger share of global GDP than it does today. But that was a time when a lower percentage of Americans of working age had a job.When you study the statistics carefully, you find that the employment-population ratio has much more to do with social factors than the strength of the economy. As it became socially acceptable (and for middle class families economically necesssary) for women to enter the workforce in large numbers, the ratio rose. As the country aged and a greater share of workers entered retirement years, the ratio fell.It’s also true that the Great Recession has affected the labor market in ways that are still being felt. Long-term unemployment skyrocketed and has yet to fall back to pre-crisis levels, and that fact shows up in the employment-population ratio. But to claim that the unemployment rate is a statistic that, as Trump said, “was made up by the politicians for the politicians . . . so they could look good,” has no basis in fact.The Labor Department compiles and publishes many different measures of the health of the labor market, with the “official” rate, also known as U3, just being one of many. As I have written before, these numbers cannot be understood in a vacuum:The economy and the labor market are certainly not back to full strength, which is why the Federal Reserve, for instance, hasn’t yet begun raising rates even with the “official” unemployment rate lower today than the post-war average. But that doesn’t mean this particular statistic is a lie, or without its uses. It’s simply one of many statistics we must use to understand the health of the economy.",http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/donald-trump-unemployment-rate-jobs/,

There's a valid, but different, conversation to have about the trend that more and more American adults aren't working. It was expected that the number of American adults in the workforce would decline as more Baby Boomers reached retirement age. Economists like to point out that the two main drivers of growth are more people working or else higher productivity. With fewer adult Americans working, that makes it more difficult for the country to grow. A common solution to that problem is letting in more immigrants, but it's hard to imagine that under a Trump administration. He even wants to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Trump with a dilemma. Data released by the Labor Department shows the U.S. added 98,000 jobs in March, which was far fewer than the 180,000 economists predicted. Last month, when February’s numbers came in at more than 235,000 new jobs, Trump, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, and nearly everyone else in the administration was quick to credit the gains to the commander in chief (although National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who knows a little bit more about this stuff than Trump and the gang that can't shoot straight, deviated from the approved talking points). Unemployment, meanwhile, fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest it has been since May 2007.The old Trump would have responded to the disappointing headline jobs number by blaming Obama, as he did repeatedly throughout his campaign. Before he was elected, Trump regularly accused the government of putting out “phony” economic data, suggesting that the “true” unemployment rate was likely as high as 42 percent. But it’s hard to do that now, after Trump took ownership for February’s blockbuster haul. As Trump’s mouthpiece explained last month in an about-face that only the Trump Team could pull off, while the unemployment rate “may have been phony in the past . . . it is very real now.”So far, Trump has been silent on the matter on Twitter, which suggests the apricot-colored hamster in his brain is trying to figure out its next move. When February’s numbers came out, he retweeted a Drudge Report headline faster than you could say “Mr. President, your colorist is waiting in the East Wing.” Perhaps he is struggling to reconcile taking credit for the new unemployment rate, which fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent, without acknowledging the jobs growth slowdown.As The New York Times notes, “the headline number for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tend to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times.” That’s why businesses had a sad little gain of 98,000 jobs “in terms of payrolls,” while households showed a 472,000 increase in employment.On Twitter, people are already taking bets on how the White House plays this thing:",https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/donald-trump-jobs-numbers-unemployment,

Ninety-three million to be exact,” he said. “If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42 percent.”Trump’s method of measuring unemployment is not the most common.The most commonly accepted way to measure the unemployment rate, the one used by the Labor Department, looks at people who do not have a job, are able to work and have actively looked for work in the past month. Under that metric, the unemployment rate was recorded at 5.3 percent in July.Trump dismissed that measurement in his interview.“It’s not 6. I’s [sic] not 5.2 and 5.5,” he said.There are other ways to measure the jobless rate. Another Labor Department measurement takes into account people who are working part-time but would prefer full-time employment, and people who want to work but have given up looking. In July, the Labor Department reported this rate to be 10.4 percent.Under Trump’s apparent method, the entire adult U.S. population would be considered potential members of the workforce. But using that ratio would include a host of people who do not work and have no intention of working. That would include full-time students, full-time parents and retirees.Trump made his unemployment claim while arguing that his immigration plan, which calls for the mass deportation of all workers in the country illegally. Critics of the plan have argued such an approach would carry a significant economic hit, because a number of industries across the country rely on a significant population of undocumented immigrants to fill out their workforce.Trump argued his approach would provide more opportunities to Americans, and allow hard-working immigrants the chance to return.“We have a lot of people who want to work.

He's really, really wrong.","The nation's unemployment rate is low. Monthly job gains are high. By all official measures, the US economy is in recovery mode. Not in Donald Trump's world.We have a real unemployment rate that’s probably 21%, Trump Time magazine this week. Our real unemployment rate — in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment — because you have ninety million people that aren’t working. Ninety-three million to be exact. If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%.Trump's inventing some new numbers, but this isn't a new line of attack from him: He's been openly skeptical of the government's job reports for years.When I spoke with the Trump campaign earlier this summer, Trump maintained that the real unemployment rate was 18 percent. (Like so many Trumpisms, the number's gone inexplicably up.)It was hard to accept Trump’s claims then. But it’s even harder now.The official unemployment rate is based on a monthly sample of households, which tracks how many people have a job, who's actively looking, and who's waiting to get called back after a recent layoff. And by this traditional measure, US unemployment has steadily plunged, from 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.3 percent in July 2015.An alternative measure of unemployment, called U-6, measures Americans who are not just unemployed but underemployed — they've settled for part-time jobs — or have given up looking altogether. The U-6 unemployment rate soared past 16 percent during the economic downturn, and it's still pretty high. According to the most recent U-6 calculations, about 10.4 percent of Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Some critics of the White House's economic policies say that's the number we should be using.But both of those figures are far from the numbers that Trump invoked.So how did Trump arrive at 42 percent unemployment? Probably by relying on a different number called the labor-force participation rate. That ratio measures the percentage of the population that's older than 16 and actively working.According to the most recent report, about 37 percent of Americans older than 16 aren't working. Factor in Trump's tendency toward exaggeration, and that's pretty close to the number he quotes to Time.Keep in mind: No one judges unemployment this way. No one should judge unemployment this way.Trump's number includes the tens of millions of Americans who actively choose not to participate in the labor force. He's counting high school and college students. Elderly Americans who chose to retire. The disabled.Even if Trump gets one point technically right — there are about 93 million Americans over age 16 without jobs — we don't want all of these people to be working. (Unless you're a fan of conscripted labor.)And that's why this isn't a honest way to assess the job market.It's worth reiterating: No one of any significance agrees with Trump's numbers. Not even the business community.I recently looked at Wall Street firms — analysts who specialize in tracking hiring patterns, and leaders of companies like Monster.com. People whose job it is to know how many jobs there are.In all cases, these firms either trust the government's numbers or have their own proprietary data that show massive declines in unemployment.According to proprietary research from Indeed.com, which bills itself as the world's largest job site, demand for labor has dramatically improved.In 2009, during the midst of the recession, the job market looked bleak with 6.2 unemployed job seekers for every opening, Indeed's researchers recently concluded.Today, economic conditions have improved with 1.7 unemployed job seekers for every opening and unemployment below 6% for the first time in six years.So it's worth remembering: When Donald Trump disputes unemployment numbers, he's not just taking on Obama. He's disagreeing with Wall Street.",https://www.vox.com/2015/8/22/9191001/donald-trump-unemployment-rate,

It's Not.,"President Donald Trump has made it clear that economic growth will be the most important measuring stick of his presidency. The state of the economy – and how it might fare during his presidency - was center stage in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump wildly over-inflated the numbers of Americans who don't have jobs (mixing retired or college students in with those who are unemployed, for instance) and promised to put millions back to work. But the laser focus on economic growth and unemployment raises an important question at a time when the economy is actually near full employment by historical standards: is the White House considering an effort to change the way in which economic data is described to the American public (so that actions are perceived differently by voters)? Given the recent news that White House aides have considered future economic growth forecasts outside the mainstream, it's an open question with no clear answer yet. [CELEBRATING WOMEN'S HISTORY: It's Been 100 Years Since Jeannette Rankin Was Sworn In, Here Are Some of the Women Who Followed Her Footsteps] White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to answer a question about the current unemployment rate at his first formal media briefing. Why? Perhaps because his boss believes that unemployment data reporting is ""fiction"" – and that the administration should change the way in which economic data is communicated to the public. Trump ""sees that people (are) hurting,"" Spicer said. The unemployment rate is ""not just a number"" to him. Trump is ""not focused on statistics"" but whether ""people are…better off."" While it's certainly true that BLS does look at different sets of economic data and the types of people who are unemployed and available to work each month, it also has established a baseline unemployment rate. It's 4.8 percent right now. That's the number the White House press secretary zigzagged around. A snapshot of the current state of the American economy looks like this: From July to September in 2016, the economy expanded at a 3.5 percent rate. That's the fastest expansion of the economy in the past two years. The Federal Reserve, which tracks the health of the American economy closely in order to make critical decisions affecting monetary policy, is so confident in the current pace of economic growth that it recently raised interest rates for just the second time in a decade. In 2015, income for a typical American household rose more than 5 percent to an inflation-adjusted $56,516 - which the Census Bureau says is the largest annual growth in nearly five decades – while average hourly pay rose in 2016 at the fastest pace in seven years, Business Insider has reported. [NEWS OF THE DAY: Poll: 78 Percent Viewed Donald Trump’s Speech to Congress Positively] All of these facts – BLS statistics on the unemployment rate, the growth and resiliency of the American economy right now, key decisions made by the Federal Reserve – conspire against Trump at the start of his presidency on the central issue that will define him. The reason the White House spokesman had to duck the question entirely is because an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent is close to a nine-year low - and is essentially at a level that economists consider full employment. Jobs have increased every month for a record 75 months in a row. The president, however, clearly doesn't believe this. ""The jobs left, and the factories closed ... the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,"" the president said in his inaugural address, while also describing an ""American carnage"" in diverse urban areas that has ""robbed our country of so much potential."" Every fact-checking team at major media outlets immediately called out the president on his claims. ""The American economy is a lot healthier than the wreck Trump describes,"" reported the Associated Press. But this may not stop Trump from creating a new set of facts around the unemployment rate. The reason is simple. He has staked his presidency on job growth. If he's measured against the real rate of 4.8 percent right now, he loses. If it's measured against a different rate at the start of his administration – one that's closer to the 40 percent rate he's said in the past that he believes is more accurate – he wins. Trump has already begun to lay the groundwork for an alternative set of facts on the unemployment rate, jobs data and the state of the economy. At an Iowa rally in December, a month after he'd been elected president, he called the unemployment rate ""totally fiction."" Political commentators have argued that Trump simply doesn't understand how unemployment rates are calculated. But they're wrong. He almost certainly understands. The problem, for the White House, is that the current facts about unemployment and jobs don't support the story he has to sell to the American public. He needs an alternative set of facts, and will almost certainly order the Labor Department and others to fall in line. [OPINION: Trump's Speech to Congress Was His Usual Nonsense in a Conventional Tone] During his campaign, Trump said that the unemployment rate was really 42 percent because there were millions of people who were not being counted as part of the labor force and should be included in the rate. For this reason, Trump argued, nearly 4 out of every 10 American adults are unemployed. What Trump has argued – and may enforce at the various branches of the federal government responsible for establishing underlying employment data – is akin to what he has argued about illegal voters for weeks. The president has doubled down by calling for a ""massive investigation"" into non-existent voter fraud. He believes millions of illegal immigrants voted in the presidential election and cost him the popular vote – which simply isn't true. He repeated that falsehood again during meetings with congressional leaders shortly after he took office. Trump also believes there are millions of people who are really unemployed, and that economists and the media are conspiring in an effort not to count them. In order to win, the president needs an alternative set of facts if he is to convince the public of the ""American carnage"" that he will soon reverse. He needs a different story in order to convince the public that he can create jobs and economic prosperity. If progress is compared against the actual 4.8 percent unemployment rate, he loses. So stay tuned. The war over the ""real"" unemployment rate - and alternative facts about it - is just around the corner.",https://www.usnews.com/news/at-the-edge/articles/2017-03-01/donald-trump-believes-unemployment-is-very-high-its-actually-48-percent,

One in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers,” he said. “The five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.”Trump’s numbers are meant to paint the American economy in a bad light. But they don’t back up the story he’s telling. Rather, they paint a portrait of how American demographics are changing.Read More: Transcript of Donald Trump’s Economic Speech in DetroitTrump is correct that fewer Americans, as a percentage of the total population, are engaged in traditional employment today. But that’s not proof that Americans are unemployed, by any traditional measure, or even underemployed. It’s evidence that the Baby Boomer generation—a massive hunk of American labor force—is currently retiring, while the next-largest generation, the Millennials, has yet to start working en masse.Many Millennials, born between about 1980 and 1995, are still in college or graduate school, taking care of young children or otherwise not fully engaged in the labor force yet.Trump’s claim that one-in-five American households “do not have a single member in the labor force” is also therefore not a reflection of employment problems so much as it’s a recognition that 20% of American households are headed by retirees. Your 85-year-old grandfather and his 82-year-old wife aren’t participating in the labor force—and that’s probably a good thing.Trump’s claim that the unemployment rate, which was 4.9% in July, is a “hoax” is problematic for the same reasons: He’s measuring the wrong thing.In an interview last summer with TIME, Trump claimed the “real” unemployment rate was about four times what the Bureau of Labor Statistics says it is. “We have a real unemployment rate that’s probably 21%. It’s not 6. It’s not 5.2 and 5.5,” he said. “Our real unemployment rate—in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment—because you have ninety million people that aren’t working. Ninety-three million to be exact. If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%.”Trump’s line of argument, which dates back at least to the 1960s, is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t accurately include people who have given up looking for work. But, again, the demographics of the American population tell a different story.While it’s true that roughly 42%, or 93 million, Americans don’t have jobs, most of that population is made up of teenagers, retirees, or stay-at-home caregivers. According to federal statistics, there are roughly 46 million Americans aged 60 and up and 10 million American teenagers. While the number of full-time caregivers is less firm, a 2015 AARP study found that roughly 34 million Americans provided care in the past 12 months to an elderly person. Nearly 25% of Americans, mostly women, are full-time stay-at-home parents, according to U.S. Census data.Seventy-one percent of 16- and 17-year-olds don’t have a job; 92% of people over 75-years-old are “unemployed” too by that same measure. (The federal government includes children as young as 16 in the labor force statistics; small children and junior high school students aren’t included in anyone’s calculations.)In other words, including grandma, your 16-year-old cousin, and a stay-at-home mom among the ranks of the “unemployed” might be technically accurate—they aren’t participating in the traditional workforce—but it doesn’t tell us anything interesting about the state of the U.S. economy.Trump claim Monday that 58% of African-American youth are “either outside the labor force or not employed” makes a similar statistical mistake: it includes all African-Americans, beginning at 16 years old, who are in high school, college, graduate school, or otherwise voluntarily out of the workforce. The real unemployment rate for African Americans 16 to 19 years old is closer to 31.8%, which is much higher than it should be, but hardly pushing 60%.By focusing on these sorts of statistics, Trump misses an opportunity to address the more immediate concerns that many his supporters—particularly white, working class Americans—are experiencing today. Many in his base are legitimately frustrated with the current economy: wages are growing painfully slowly; service jobs are less lucrative than the union-backed factory and mining jobs of a generation ago; and health care, child care, and education are vastly more costly today, as a percentage of income, than they were three decades ago. Those are all issues that many working class Americans feel in their bones.But the numbers Trump used Monday don’t tell that story.Correction: The original version of this story misstated the unemployment rate in July 2016. It was 4.9%.",http://time.com/4443598/donald-trump-unemployment-statistics/,

Rumors of ISIS members slipping through southern borders escalated significantly on 2014 when Hunter of California told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that as many as ten ISIS militants had been apprehended at southern crossings.Van Susteren pressed Hunter after he stated that ISIS members had been caught attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, following a broader statement by the Congressman on concern for border security. Hunter replied by saying:  ISIS is coming across the southern border. They aren’t flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico. I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas. Van Susteren questioned Hunter on why he specifically believed ten ISIS members had crossed the border and were caught, to which he replied that “Border Patrol” had confirmed the information to him. Hunter stated that Border Patrol agents “caught” those ISIS insurgents but added that “there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.”Hunter’s claims seemed to fall directly in line with several made by the disreputable Judicial Watch site, a muckraking organization run by “political activist” Larry Klayman (who issued a press release in October 2014 announcing he was petitioning several federal agencies to deport President Obama, and who has been barred for life by multiple judges for his repetitive misuse of the court system). Since August 2014, Judicial Watch has been claiming that the U.S.-Mexico border is vulnerable to ISIS, stating in a “bulletin” on 2014 that:  There are times when all of us hate to say, “I told you so.” And the latest news from Judicial Watch on the apprehension of ISIS terrorists on the U.S.-Mexico border is certainly one of them. There are times when all of us hate to say, “I told you so.” And the latest news from Judicial Watch on the apprehension of ISIS terrorists on the U.S.-Mexico border is certainly one of them. In late August, you may recall, JW broke the story that Islamic terrorist organizations are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez where they plan to stage attacks against the U.S. In response to this threat, agents in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense had all been placed on alert and told to work to counter the imminent threat. Two days after our initial report, Fort Bliss, the massive installation in El Paso, increased its security in response to this international terrorist threat. But then the Obama spin machine cranked up. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security officially denied the report, telling the London Daily Mail, “we are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim.” The DHS official duplicitously added, “In Mexico? I haven’t seen that at all.” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also responded, telling the newspaper that “the most detailed intelligence assessment that I can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that [the Islamic State group] is actively plotting to attack the United States homeland. That’s true right now.” At Judicial Watch, we pulled no punches in standing by our story. We told the Daily Mail that JW’s sources were “golden,” and that the government’s denial constituted a “non-denial denial.” As I pointed out, the words “credible” and “specific” were rhetorical loopholes that one “could drive a truck bomb through,” the paper reported. In the original “bulletin” issued by Judicial Watch on 2014, the site claimed an attack by ISIS due to border porosity was imminent. The report heavily implied the anniversary of the attacks as a potential attack date and claimed that:  Intelligence officials have picked up radio talk and chatter indicating that the terrorist groups are going to “carry out an attack on the border,” according to one JW source. “It’s coming very soon,” according to another high-level source, who clearly identified the groups planning the plots as “ISIS and An attack is so imminent that the commanding general at Ft. Bliss, the U.S. Army post in El Paso, is being briefed, JW’s sources say. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to multiple inquiries from Judicial Watch, both telephonic and in writing, about this information. The claims by Judicial Watch of an “imminent” attack “coming very soon” were made on 2014, and Hunter’s statements came more than a month later. No such attack or confirmed attempt to cross the border by members of ISIS occurred in the intervening weeks between the “bulletin” and Hunter’s appearance on Fox News to substantiate beliefs that ISIS either had crossed or had intended to cross the .The inclusion in the rumor of an “in the last modifier created an impression of urgency without specifying when the event itself occurred (and enabled the rumor to spread ad infinitum.) On 2014, a senior spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security responded to Hunter’s claim about ISIS fighters captured by Border Patrol:  The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border. No reports of any arrests matching the claims made by Hunter or Judicial Watch materialized in the time the rumor has been circulating, and it seems safe to say at this remove that the timeframe has come and gone without incident.Judicial Watch similarly claimed in an April 2015 article that “ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas,” “in an area known as ‘Anapra’ situated just west of Ciudad Juárez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.” Several federal law agencies involved with border security said the report was unverified and that it was unlikely ISIS is in Anapra or Juarez, and Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, Mexico’s minister for press and public affairs, also disclaimed the report:  The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS’s operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua — El Paso, Texas. The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS’s operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua — El Paso, Texas. The relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the inexistence of these activities with their US counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border.” Moreover, El Paso Congressman Beto O’Rourke debunked this rumor on Facebook:  Today I reached out to the Mexican government, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Northern Command. Today I reached out to the Mexican government, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Northern Command. None of them have found any evidence, credible or otherwise, that Isis is in Juárez. Stories like these are good at scaring people and getting attention for those who spread them. But they are terrible for the country’s image of the border, for El Paso’s ability to recruit talent, and for our region’s opportunity to capitalize on the benefits of being the largest bi-national community in the world. As a member of the House Homeland Security committee in the 113th Congress, I asked the director of the FBI, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Secretary of Homeland Security if there was currently any terrorist threat on the Southern border. They answered that there was not, nor had there ever been, any terrorist, terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that was able to exploit our border with Mexico. Beyond hurting our image nationally, these kinds of false stories could lead us to take our eye off real threats to the homeland. While we should always remain vigilant at our borders — and we currently spend $18 billion a year to do so — the greatest proven homeland threats have been at our airports and with homegrown terrorists radicalized over the internet.

There's drugs pouring over, DeWit said. Now we have ISIS coming over the border. You have problems. There's only one candidate that's going to do anything to fix it, and that's Donald Trump.He isn’t the first Arizona official to tie ISIS to the U.S-Mexico border. But there’s no evidence to support the claim.We decided to delve into DeWit’s ISIS claim. Is this terrorist group crossing the border?DeWit spokesman Sean Dollman provided us with links to several news stories, including the Judicial Watch report cited by Hunter.Dollman said it is well-documented enough to be mentioned by the Treasurer as a valid concern. But he could not provide us with actual evidence that ISIS is crossing the border.Multiple officials disputed DeWit’s claim. While a small number of people from Middle Eastern countries have been detained near the border, none have been tied to ISIS (also called Islamic State or ISIL).Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Damon Cecil could not confirm the presence of ISIS at the border.We do know that people from Middle Eastern countries have crossed the U.S./Mexican border in Arizona. We are not able to confirm that anyone caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico has ties to ISIS or any other terrorist organization, Cecil said.The influx of immigrants from the Middle East using the U.S.-Mexico border, however, goes back several years.A report released in 2006 from the House Committee on Homeland Security states that each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism are routinely encountered when they attempt to cross the border.The report also notes that several items have been found at the Rio Grande River, which runs from Colorado through Mexico, including a jacket with patches from countries where al-Qaida is known to operate.Moreover, the report definitively states that members of terrorist group Hezbollah have already entered the United States using the border sometime before 2005.An August 2009 Government Accountability Office report also notes that Border Patrol encountered three people with links to terrorism at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008.The House Committee on Homeland Security released an updated report in 2012. According to this report, from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, 1,918 special interest aliens, or aliens with ties to countries that could bring harm via terrorism, were apprehended at the border.But, as far as ISIS, the connection isn’t there.Recently, Border Patrol agents detained five Pakistani immigrants and one Afghan immigrant near the Arizona border in November 2015. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that records checks on the immigrants revealed no derogatory information.Eight Syrians were also stopped at the Texas border in November, but DHS said they were regular migrants.Colin Clarke, an international security expert at the Rand Corporation, said he hasn’t seen any evidence of ISIS coming in over the border, but it’s possible.The border is vulnerable, why wouldn’t they try that? Clarke said. It’s certainly feasible that these guys could, through multiple attempts, smuggle someone across.Tim Nichols, an intelligence expert and associate professor at Duke University, said he is not aware of any information supporting DeWit’s statement. And neither are the feds.The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson.We also reached out to Mexico’s embassy in Washington D.C. Their spokesman, Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, refuted DeWit’s claim.The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies any statement on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region. Mexican authorities have no record of the presence of Islamist extremist groups or individuals in Mexico. Officials from Mexico and the United States maintain permanent contact with each other and continuously exchange information on security threats, Morales said.There were no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, despite several erroneous press reports to the contrary during 2014. There was no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory.DeWit said, now we have ISIS coming over the border. There is no definitive evidence of that.Yes, people with ties to the Middle East have been encountered at the border. Members of terrorist group Hezbollah entered the United States via the border sometime before 2005. But there’s no evidence that terrorists linked to ISIS have crossed the border, and many public safety officials have said flatly that it hasn’t happened.For that, we rate DeWit’s claim as False.",http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/mar/10/jeff-dewit/isis-crossing-us-mexico-border/,
At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas and there are dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/oct/10/duncan-hunter-2/duncan-hunter-makes-unconfirmed-claim-border-patro/,False,---,False,True,Can not judge,Unrelated,,"Terrorists from groups besides ISIS crossing U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis says","Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.Instead of worrying about ISIS infiltrating the country, U.S. Senate candidate and Rep. Ron DeSantis is concerned that members of other terrorist groups have already been caught trying to sneak across the border from Mexico.The Ponte Vedra Beach Republican called a hearing of the House Oversight Committee’s National Security subcommittee to discuss what to do about what he considered a growing threat.Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years, he said March 23, 2016.DeSantis has made terrorism a central issue in his campaign. On April 4, 2016, he embarked on a series of town hall-style events in Florida he dubbed the Defeat the Jihad Tour.We’ve checked hyperbole by politicians that ISIS is invading via the southern border time and time and time again. Because there’s no hard evidence it is happening, those claims range from Mostly False to Pants On Fire!But we don’t often hear politicians warn about about immigrants with ties to other terrorist organizations being caught secretly heading into the United States. According to some reports, those apprehensions do happen, although experts told us any true threat may be a bit exaggerated.When we contacted DeSantis’ office, a spokeswoman pointed us to a 2015 article from the Houston Chronicle as the source of his statement. The newspaper published a report for elected officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety that said shifting law enforcement sources to protect the border led to crime problems in other parts of the state.But the report also said that authorities had detained several people with ties to Islamist terrorist organizations, a point the Washington Post highlighted in a follow-up. The Texas agency told the Post that the Chronicle had not properly obtained the report, which they said wasn’t meant for the public.Along with human traffickers, drug-cartel and gang members, law enforcement personnel in recent years had several run-ins with so-called special interest aliens. These are people coming into the United States from 35 Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries associated with terrorist groups.Texas reported 439 cases of people from these countries — including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan and Syria — either caught crossing the border or presenting themselves at ports of entry without permission to enter. The report also said authorities had reported 143 land border crossing encounters with watch-listed individuals in southwest border states between November 2013 and July 2014.These encounters included one with an alleged member of al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based group responsible for the 2013 mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya. In June 2014, he said he had been trained for a suicide attack in Mogadishu but escaped and surrendered to African Union troops, who stopped the attack. That account was unverified and the person sought immigration benefits from the United States, the report said.The report also noted the 2008 apprehension of a Somali named Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane, whom the government said had ties to terrorist groups al-Shabaab, al-Itihaad al-Islamiya and al-Barakat. Dhakane had crossed into Texas and helped move an unknown number of suspected Somali terrorists, as well, although he had claimed he was seeking asylum for religious persecution in Somalia. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2011.It further said one U.S. citizen had smuggled 272 Somalis into the United States through Cuba and Mexico until January 2010. Although he claimed he had been approached by al-Shabaab members for help smuggling people, he said he’d refused, the report said.Also detained were three Sri Lankans, one of whom said he was a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and was on his way to Canada.There are many more instances than what was detailed by Texas officials, too.A  2006 House Committee on Homeland Security report said that each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism are found trying to cross the border along the Rio Grande Valley. It said members of Hezbollah have already entered the United States across the border prior to 2005.A Government Accountability Office report from August 2009 said Border Patrol apprehended three people with links to terrorism at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008.An updated 2012 report from the House Committee on Homeland Security said 1,918 special interest aliens were stopped at the border from fiscal years 2006 to 2011.Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the common thread in these types of reports is not so much that notorious terrorists had been arrested, but that immigrants with ties to terrorist organizations had been caught.I haven’t seen this as a method that terrorists have regularly used, he said of infiltrating the southern border. There are more efficient ways to get in where you don’t have to violate U.S. law.That’s not to say the border isn’t porous, because immigrants from other countries continue to arrive via Mexico.Five Pakistanis and one Afghan were caught by Border Patrol agents near the Arizona border in November 2015. U.S. Customs and Border Protection records checks didn’t turn up any derogatory information. That same month, eight Syrians — two sets of parents and four children — were stopped at the Texas border, but Homeland Security said they were regular migrants who weren’t evading authorities.Rand Corporation political scientist Colin Clarke said there are many challenges to enforcing border security beyond domestic policy. He noted places like Ecuador, which in 2008 dropped its visa requirements for admission. Lax policies make it much easier for groups to attempt getting into the United States. In 2011, three Pakistani citizens pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle in a member of the Pakistani Taliban from Ecuador.It is possible and plausible that terrorists would cross the Mexican border, Clarke said. But while it’s a problem worth addressing, it’s not something Americans should panic about. Unlike Europe, which has extensive, hidden support systems that could assist infiltrators, a terrorist coming to the United States wouldn’t easily live off the grid for long.Getting across the border is one thing, having a network of logistics in place to put together what's needed to conduct an effective attack is another altogether, he said.DeSantis said, Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.There have been several reported incidents along the U.S.-Mexico border of several agencies encountering people on terrorism watch lists or with ties (or suspected ties) to terrorist groups. There also have been a number of people from countries associated with terror groups stopped by authorities, although that’s not an indication they’re terrorist infiltrators. Experts noted that while border security is always a concern, this issue is far from a pressing crisis.The statement is accurate but needs some clarification about the threat involved. We rate it Mostly True.",http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/apr/04/ron-desantis/terrorists-groups-besides-isis-crossing-us-mexico-/,

It did not go well.,"During an interview with The Ralph Bailey Show on Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to explain the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program scale-back, immigration, and the debate over the southern border to a political science professor from California State University, Bakersfield. The professor just didn’t understand the issues with immigration, how border patrol operates, or why Mexico was so dangerous, McCarthy claimed. “Have you ever been to the border?” he asked.There was just one problem: the professor to whom McCarthy was speaking— Mark Martinez—had indeed been to the border. In fact, Martinez had previously taught graduate studies in Mexico at the Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, hundreds of miles south of the border and has a wide breadth of knowledge in political development, international relations, and American foreign policy.“Mark, have you spent any time with the border agents, down along the border?” McCarthy asked, in response to accusations that he and many Republicans were feeding the racist components of President Trump’s base by pushing the idea of a wall and deporting DACA recipients. “Have you asked what’s coming across? Have you watched the amount of drugs, have you [seen] the tunnels from [Mexico]?”“Absolutely,” Martinez replied. “Kevin, I’ve lived in Mexico. Have you ever lived in Mexico, Kevin?”To his credit, McCarthy managed to smooth over the gaffe, ignoring the professor’s questions and choosing instead to deflect by moving on to a new topic: ISIS militants hauling bombs across the southern border to terrorize Americans.“If you look at the intelligence reports, for those in the Middle East that want to do America harm, they talk about [how] the number one way to do it is to get a suitcase bomb and come across the border illegally,” he said. McCarthy also claimed President Obama had signed orders saying that Border Patrol agents were “not even allowed to use motorized vehicles.” (McCarthy appeared to be inaccurately describing Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) rules that protect certain wilderness areas from being damaged by construction or vehicles. GOP efforts to dismantle those rules failed in 2014.)On this point, McCarthy was also mistaken. Rumors about ISIS militants infiltrating the country through the southern border popped up back in 2014, after Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) claimed during an interview with Fox News that “at least 10 ISIS fighters [had] been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.” Hunter claimed he had heard the reports from Border Patrol agents and that “there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.” A senior official from the Department of Homeland Security later debunked Hunter’s claims, calling them “categorically false.”“DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border,” the official stated.On Tuesday, Martinez criticized McCarthy’s faulty claims, pointing out that his arguments in favor of rolling back DACA and building a border wall—President Trump’s pet cause—were moot.“It’s going to do nothing to make this country more secure,” he said, referring to the wall specifically. “The issue that we have with the people who are coming across has nothing to do with terrorism. It has nothing to do with making our country safer. [You’re only] feeding a rabid political base.”McCarthy had spoken out against DACA and in favor of increased border measures earlier in the week, after the Trump administration announced it intends to end the DACA program. McCarthy praised the move, blasting the Obama administration for ever implementing DACA in the first place.“President Obama was wrong to try to make immigration law by executive order like he did with DACA and DAPA,” McCarthy said in a statement. “It is Congress’s role and responsibility to make immigration law and I believe this is an issue that Congress needs to address. Over the next few months, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues so we can strengthen border security and fix our broken immigration system.”",https://thinkprogress.org/republican-leader-tells-professor-who-taught-in-mexico-that-he-doesnt-understand-the-border-debate-a8c52f36b67c/,

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns.ISIS is coming across the southern border, he told Fox News. They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.Hunter continued: I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.He claimed Border Patrol caught them, but you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim.The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground, a senior DHS spokesman said. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with known ISIS affiliations -- came from a high-level source within the Border Patrol.The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told, Kasper said. It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were scrutinized very, very carefully and officials found no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from special interest countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL into the U.S. through the southern border.Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be vigilant and aware of the possibility of potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to exploit the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.He complained that the administration has widened the loophole they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would legalize visa overstays and raise the threat level to America even higher. He said there is no doubt many are already being targeted for radicalization.FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/08/congressman-at-least-10-isis-fighters-caught-trying-to-cross-into-us.html,

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”",http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/10/08/gop-rep-at-least-ten-isis-fighters-have-been-caught-coming-across-the-mexican-border/,

Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border.'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.'The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.'The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said'In Mexico?

Far fewer know that, in fact, these four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted to a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker's Party - an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq. Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.Johnson was referring to a Sept. 17 House Homeland Security Committee hearing where Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked Johnson if he was aware that four individuals with ties to known terrorist organizations in the Middle East were apprehended trying to cross the border into Texas.I've heard reports to that effect. I don't know the accuracy of the reports or how much credence to give them. But I've heard reports to that effect, Johnson said at the time.Johnson's remarks Thursday attempted to rebut claims that we have an open, 'porous' border, through which unaccompanied minors and members of terrorist organizations such as ISIL may pass.In an interview with CBS News following Johnson's comments, Chaffetz stood by his concerns noting that the PKK has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department.I don't think that should be dismissed as insignificant. It does demonstrate how porous or our border is. These are terrorists nonetheless and they had no trouble crossing our southern border. That's a problem that must be addressed, Chaffetz said.Chaffetz said that the men flew into Mexico City, hired a coyote to help them reach and cross the Rio Grande, and then make their way to a safe house. They intended to make their way to New York City, he said in an earlier interview with CBS News, although there was no specific indication they were here to commit a terrorist act.My question is: why aren't we prosecuting them, why are we simply deporting them? he asked.There's no doubt in my mind that they're tied with terrorists. To try to say that they were good terrorists is a bit concerning coming from the Homeland Security Secretary, Chaffetz continued. We were lucky that they're not tied with ISIS. They could have been.He said he believed the information would not have become public if he had not pressed DHS for the information and questioned why the men are not being prosecuted.Separately, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, said on Fox News Tuesday that, I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas. He cited the Border Patrol as the source of the information.DHS was quick to say that was untrue.The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground, DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron said in a statement.

There are propagandists who lie to cover up what the real facts are.And then there are propagandists who just don’t care.It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that U.S. Rep. Duncan D. Hunter, a Republican congressman who represents the area around San Diego, belongs in the latter category. Since appearing on Oct. 7 on Fox News’ “On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,” Hunter has not produced the remotest shred of evidence to support the claims he made there — and he even doubled down on them as news organization after news organization found them to be utterly false.“ISIS is coming across the border,” Hunter told Van Susteren, referring to the Islamic State, the infamous Middle Eastern terror group known for its beheadings. “They don’t fly B-1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.”Van Susteren asked if he could back his claim.“Yes,” he replied. “Yes, I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas. There’s nobody talking about it.”“Because I’ve asked the Border Patrol, Greta,” he said. He added: “If they catch five or 10 of them, then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol. ... All you have to do is ask the Border Patrol.”The Department of Homeland Security immediately called Hunter’s fairy tale “categorically false.” The Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators saying it had nothing to back up the claim, and a spokesman for the Border Patrol agents’ union said the same. Terrorism analysts said they knew nothing of any arrests. And PolitiFact, known for carefully examining such claims, concluded it was a “Pants on Fire” falsehood.Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, is a longtime immigration opponent, even advocating the deportation of citizens who are children of undocumented immigrants. Clearly, to support his nativist claims he was willing to say just about anything — whether or not it had any relation to the truth.His statements illustrate the nativist hysteria sweeping the country.In this issue’s cover story, we examine the return to the border of nativist extremists in the wake of a surge of unaccompanied minor immigrants that began earlier this year. Although the Minuteman movement that swept the country between 2005 and 2011 has receded, the news of tens of thousands of undocumented children arriving on the border has spurred what may become a major revival of the armed civilian groups that President George W. Bush once labeled “vigilantes.”There’s no doubt that the humanitarian crisis on the border drew opportunistic extremists from the radical right. But as we report here, the demonizing propaganda and conspiracy theories that dominated the political reaction to the crisis originated mainly in the political mainstream — with people like Congressman Hunter.Hunter’s rumor-mongering was only the latest to emanate from the political right, from Fox News and other right-wing outlets to an array of fact-challenged politicians, pundits and preachers. Earlier, there were claims that the children were really gangsters and drug runners; that they were carrying an array of dread diseases including leprosy; that the government intended to house them in a luxury resort; and that Obama was bringing them in to create new Democratic voters.Hunter wasn’t the only fear merchant selling the ISIS story. In late August, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that it was a “very real possibility” that ISIS had crossed the southern border — but added that he had no evidence to back that up. Other Texas politicians have made similar statements. Around the same time that Perry spoke, Judicial Watch, an extremist group run by conspiracy-monger Larry Klayman, also began claiming ISIS was headed north from Mexico.But it was thanks to Hunter that the story metastasized.Within days of Hunter’s comments on Fox, Jerome Corsi, who wrote a book claiming Obama is not eligible for the presidency, said the president was planning for the U.S. to be “invaded simultaneously by illegal immigrant Hispanics and ISIS radical Islamic terrorists walking across the border.” Others added Ebola into the equation, suggesting that the disease was just another “engineered event” created by an Obama bent on America’s destruction. It was, in many ways, a replay of the way that demonizing propaganda about the unaccompanied children exploded.Propaganda, especially when it comes from those who are perceived as leaders, has consequences. Instead of dealing with the very real problems that face us — impoverished children and others surging across our borders, the arrival of the Ebola virus in the U.S., and the very real threat posed by ISIS, for a start — we become mired in an angry debate that is based not on facts but on fantasies.Duncan Hunter, like so many others, should be ashamed.",https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/editorial-propaganda-duncan-hunter-and-border,

He said he looks at intelligence reports from overseas and the U.S. southern border “virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature.”The spokeswoman for his agency, Marsha Catron, also told KPBS on Wednesday that Hunter’s claims that individuals with ties to ISIS (also known as ISIL) have been caught at the border with Mexico were “categorically false.”James Kimber, Hunter’s Democratic challenger in the Nov. 4 election, called the claims “ludicrous.”“Certainly we need to be vigilant, we need to protect our borders,” Kimber said. “But to make that statement, for what purpose I have no idea, when there’s no credible information to back it up, is really reckless.”Other Republican politicians have also said that ISIS terrorists pose a threat to cross into the U.S. from Mexico. Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, who’s running for the U.S. Senate, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry have both warned of the imminent threat of ISIS fighters trying to sneak in through the porous southern border.Last month, Sheriff Gary Painter of Midland County, Texas, told Fox News said he had received an intelligence report about ISIS cells moving around near Juarez, the Mexican border town just south of El Paso.“People along the border, where the trails of these people coming across, have found Muslim clothing, have found Koran books, laying on the side of the road or side of the trail,” Painter said. “So we know that there are Muslims that have come across and been smuggled into the United States.”Fears and rumors about terrorists entering the U.S. through the southern border emerged after the 9-11 attacks.A 2005 report from the Congressional Research Service on Border Patrol apprehensions of so-called “Other Than Mexicans” found that “the data indicate that each year hundreds of aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism are apprehended attempting to enter the country illegally between POE (Ports of Entry).”No terrorists attacks, however, have ever occurred in the U.S. where the people entered through Mexico.Recently, Homeland Security officials have repeatedly refuted claims of ISIS affiliates planning to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.Following Homeland Security Secretary Johnson’s rebuttal of Hunter’s ISIS claim, the congressman’s spokesman, Kasper, said “a denial by DHS fails to account for information confirmed by other entities, through their own sourcing.”Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents’ union, said he believed there was some truth to Hunter’s statement about the ISIS threat.“I haven't been able to confirm anything from CBP (Customs and Border Protection) or Border Patrol, …but (Hunter’s) source seems credible,” he said, explaining that he had spoken to Hunter’s office and investigated the claim on his own.Moran said he believed “that someone with connections to ISIS has been arrested” near the Texas border, though he added, “we don't know how nebulous” those connections might be.He said he hadn’t received any information about ISIS or other new threats from his superiors, or any calls to be on heightened alert. “We've gotten no guidance on ISIS, no guidance on Ebola, Moran said. “No briefings, no announcements that there will be policies or training.",http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/oct/09/congressman-hunter-10-isis-terrorists-tried-enter-/,

Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.

The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons.

Duncan Hunter told “On the Record” with Greta Van Susteren yesterday. “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter stated.Duncan noted that he learned of the terrorist group’s attempt to enter the US from sources within the US Border Patrol.“And the border patrol just let’s ISIS members come across the border?” asked Van Susteren.“No. They caught them at the border,” elaborated Duncan. “Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them, you know that there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol. That’s how you know. That’s where we are at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border. Once again, they don’t have a navy, air force, nuclear weapons. The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islam — Chairman Dempsey said the same thing. He said that’s where the major threat is here, that’s how these guy guys are going to infiltrate through America and harm Americans.”As the immigration crisis accelerated over the summer, and as violence from the Islamic State terrorist group grew overseas, it was speculated that the radicalized Islamic jihadists supposedly intent on harming America would finally be able to do so by exploiting lax border enforcement.The fact that the southern border was essentially wide open was further illustrated by Infowars reporter Joe Biggs on multiple occasions, and by Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe, who crossed the southern border dressed as Osama bin Laden, encountering no resistance whatsoever.Last month, government watchdog group Judicial Watch also released a report citing high-level inside sources which said an ISIS attack on US soil was “imminent” and “coming very soon.”“An attack is so imminent that the commanding general at Ft. Bliss, the U.S. Army post in El Paso, is being briefed, another source confirms,” Judicial Watch reported in late August. “The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to multiple inquiries from Judicial Watch, both telephonic and in writing, about this information.”Federal officialdom responded that they were unaware of any threats along the border.“There is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by ISIL to attempt to cross the southern border,” a Homeland Security official declared in a statement obtained by The New York Times.Rep.

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on the health care law and claims to have the facts. But then it trots out a series of well-worn distortions.  Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law, the ad says. Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law.  The ad is from an outside spending group called American Commitment, which said on its website that it supports free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom. It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.)  We fact-checked the claim that Nelson was the deciding vote in another fact-check, rating it Mostly False. We've also looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False).Here, we’re fact-checking whether the health care law imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.  We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back.  We found the same claim, though, on several conservative blogs. Their basis for making the claim focused on the tax penalty that’s part of the health care law, the penalty imposed on people who go without health insurance.  The individual mandate as tax penalty  Here’s how it works: Starting in 2014, individuals who do not have health insurance and who aren't exempt (say, for cases of hardship or religious belief) will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95. The amount increases, though, up to $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- up to 2.5 percent of household income.  Critics of the law have pointed out, correctly, that some people who make less than $250,000 will be subject to this tax penalty. During the 2008 campaign, Obama pledged not to raise taxes on families who make less than that.  The blogs said that 75 percent of the people who pay the penalty are in the middle class, so that makes it the biggest middle-class tax increase in history. This is a logical fallacy -- just because 75 percent of the households who pay the tax are in the middle class, that doesn’t automatically make it the largest middle-class tax increase in history.  But let’s set that problem aside for moment so we can explore who’s paying the mandate. Then we’ll get to other problems with the ad’s claim.  Who pays the individual mandate’s tax penalty  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- two nonpartisan federal offices -- have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans will have to pay the penalty, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019.  The CBO projections show that 76 percent of the people paying the penalty will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For a family of four, that comes to about $120,000.  We should note that there is no standard definition of the middle class. We looked at projections from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center for what the federal income distribution will look like in 2016. A chart from the center estimates that the threshold for the top 20 percent of income in 2016 will be $123,970. So statements like these essentially define middle class as the bottom 80 percent of the income scale.  But there’s a different way to look at who pays the penalty, and that’s as a tally of dollars paid, rather than the number of households.  The CBO projected that the bottom 80 percent will pay 46 percent of the tax dollars collected as a result of the mandate. That’s compared to 55 percent of revenues that will come from the top 20 percent.  This presents a different picture of how the financial burden of the mandate will be borne. There’s a big difference between the middle class carrying 75 percent of the burden rather than 46 percent of the burden.  Two tax experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and William McBride of the Tax Foundation -- agreed with our analysis when we looked at a similar claim. They also indicated that, it’s more appropriate to use dollars paid than the number of households that have to pay the penalty.  Other taxes dwarf the mandate  Now we come to another problem with the ad’s claim -- whether the tax increases in the law are the largest in history.  It’s true that some middle-class people will pay the tax penalty for not having insurance. But as we noted earlier, that penalty is intended to encourage people to get insurance. It’s not intended to raise enough money to pay for the bulk of new spending in the health care law. Other tax increases do that.  Most of those tax increases are on the wealthy and the health-care industry -- not the middle class.  Starting in 2013, high earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, people at these income levels pay a new tax on investment income of 3.8 percent.  The 10-year tally: $210.2 billion. That easily outpaces $4 billion per year that comes from the individual mandate.  For other new taxes in the law, it’s less clear how the burden will fall. These taxes include annual fees on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years).  Also, there’s a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called Cadillac plans, which begins in 2018, raising $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.  Largest tax increase?  Finally, the health care law is not the largest tax increase in history. We looked into this topic in detail when we fact-checked Rush Limbaugh’s statement that the health care law is the largest tax increase in the history of the world.  That detailed analysis can be found here, but the bottom line is this:  Depending on your rounding, tax increases resulting from the health care law are about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.         The health care law’s tax increases are smaller than tax increases signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961.         It’s true that the tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993.  But they are not the largest in the history of the United States.  Our ruling  The ad calls the health care law the largest tax increase in history on the middle class. Actually, the law is not the largest tax increase in history, and most of its taxes fall on the wealthy and the health care industry.  Even if all of the taxes in the health care law fell on the middle class -- which they don’t -- the statement still wouldn’t be accurate.

Individuals who don't buy insurance will have to pay several hundred dollars, depending on income. The Congressional Budget Office says that 76% of those who pay the mandate tax will make less than 500% of the federal poverty level, estimated to be $24,000 for a family of four in 2016. That means 76% of the payers will earn less than $120,000 a year. So much for Mr. Obama's promise not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $200,000. And this initial mandate tax will only be a teaser rate when it becomes clear it isn't nearly enough either to finance the bill or drive individuals to buy insurance. Millions will wait to buy insurance until they need expensive treatment, knowing they can always buy it when they show up at the hospital.The Journal's analysis is clear and follows directly from CBO numbers.  The mandate tax falls overwhelmingly on the middle class, making it the largest tax increase in history on the middle class as a distributional matter.  The howls of protest from the left on this simple observation are odd considering their usual obsession with distributional tables.Moreover, as the Journal observes, the initial rate -- 2.5 percent of adjusted gross-income up to $2085 per family by 2016 -- cannot be adequate to force low utilizers of health care to spend over $12,000 a year for Bronze Level coverage, the least expensive plans in the new health care system.  Thus the tax will be steeply raised over time.And the number of people affected by the tax is not the 4-6 million suggested by CBO analysis. To begin with, the relevant number also includes people who buy insurance they would otherwise not buy, who are being forced to spend thousands of dollars one way or another.  That number is around 20 million people.  As House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp explained:The Congressional Budget Office predicts that approximately 20 million Americans will either pay the tax or be forced to buy insurance that they otherwise wouldn't purchase.  Only two states in the U.S. have more than 20 million people – California and Texas.  So despite the Obama Administration’s claim that few Americans will be impacted by this new tax, 20 million Americans, most of whom are middle-income, will soon beg to differ.Even more significantly, the impact estimates have not been revised to take into account Chief Justice John Roberts reconstruction of the statute to replace the mandate as a legal command with a neutral take-it-or-leave-it tax.As Steven G. Bradbury explained in excellent testimony this week to the House Ways and Means Committee, the mandate was designed to force low-utilizers of health care to pay for care they don't use. He said:Bradbury went on to explain that, now that the Supreme Court has reconstructed the statute to remove the legal mandate, the number of people paying the explicit tax to the government rather than the implicit tax of buying insurance they otherwise wouldn't buy will be significantly higher:It is logical to understand that this earlier CBO projection was based in part on the assumption that most Americans would naturally feel a strong moral imperative to comply with the sort of direct legal requirement that the minimum coverage provision was originally thought to be, even if that requirement was not initially en-forced with criminal sanctions. Now that the Supreme Court has announced to the whole world that the minimum coverage provision is, in fact, not a legal mandate, but is only a tax assessment, it is equally logical to assume that the actual number of individuals who will choose to pay the tax rather than purchase insurance will be considerably greater than originally projected.The mandate was always an attempt to salvage a failed regulatory model, as the empirical evidence from the eight states that adopted guarantee issue and community rating in the 1990s shows.This law requires insurance companies to issue policies to people after they get sick at the same premiums they charge healthy people.  That creates an overwhelming incentive to forego insurance unless and until you get sick.  A tax of two thousand dollars will not compel a person to spend at least $12,000 on an insurance plan if that person isn't using health care and can't be charged more after the fact.The mandate was a clumsy, heavy-handed, and -- we now know -- unconstitutional way to attempt to overcome this problem.  It was tossed out in Court, but reconstructed as a tax. Now millions will pay that tax, while health insurance markets are destroyed by adverse selection.The Wall Street Journal is right: this is largest tax increase in history on the middle class -- if Congress doesn't repeal it before it takes hold.",https://www.americancommitment.org/the-largest-tax-increase-in-history-on-the-middle-class,

Bush who, in 1992, campaigned with the bold slogan, “Read my lips, no new taxes!”  Violating that pledge was perhaps the most important reason why voters threw him out.In 2009, George Stephanopoulos interviewed President Obama who emphatically denied that Obamacare penalties were taxes.  Obama declared, “For us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase.  George, you can’t just make up the language and say that’s a tax increase.  I absolutely reject the notion [that Obamacare penalties are taxes].”Well, guess what, folks!  Chief Justice Roberts and the other liberals on the court have determined that the Obamacare penalties really are taxes – mostly middle class taxes.  These middle class taxes go into effect in 2014, unless Obamacare is repealed.In March 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that during the next decade, the mandate tax and other Obamacare taxes would exceed $400 billion.Court liberals ruled that while forcing people to buy something cannot be justified by the Commerce Clause, it can be justified by imposing a tax.Big health insurance honchos must be licking their chops, since the Supreme Court decision to uphold mandate taxes means everyone will be forced to buy their products.  The decision could usher in the biggest expansion of crony capitalism in the history of the United States.This is probably just the beginning.  There is, in fact, no effective limit on what government can force people to buy and pay for with yet another tax.For example, in an effort to pay for Obamacare deficits, a second Obama administration conceivably could announce a confiscatory tax that involves seizing private 401(K) and pension plans, like Argentina’s deficit-plagued national government did in 2008.Of course, it was no secret that Obamacare is all about taxes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimpowell/2012/06/29/supreme-court-outs-obama-as-the-biggest-middle-class-tax-hiker/,

Representative Connie Mack (R-FL), called it “the largest tax on the American people in history.” Conservative media, such as Fox News, instantly starting repeating this claim. Rush Limbaugh went even further, saying, “Obamacare is nothing more than the largest tax increase in the history of the world.By Friday the new falsehood was so well-established among Republicans that it could be cited by Republican strategists as an objective circumstance in a Washington Post article. “This ruling is the kiss of death for the Democrat majority in the U.S. Senate as health care just became a tax increase on the middle class in one of the worst economies Americans have ever faced,” Republican strategist Chris LaCivita was quoted as saying in the Post.The claim that the ACA will impose a large tax, much less the largest in American history, is simply false. The tax it will impose is a penalty paid by those who do not have insurance and refuse to purchase it. Another way of describing it would be a user fee for emergency room care by those who refuse to pay their fair share for a healthcare system they will surely want to use if they are shot or hit by a car.The law, of course, will assist the poor in affording health insurance. So in addition to the majority of Americans who are already covered, most will buy it. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates only 4 million Americans will face the penalty.According to Politifact, a nonpartisan, Pulitzer Prize–winning fact-checking organization, “Limbaugh, GOP have it wrong: Health care law is not the largest tax increase ever.” Politifact ran the numbers, and here is what they found:In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP. Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W.

The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. And—despite what Limbaugh said—that means they cannot be the largest ever in the history of world.

See Video: Rep. Michele Bachmann lays out the massive tax plan behind Obamacare - Click Here Now Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., tells Newsmax TV’s Ashley Martella the Democrats care more about exercising their “one-party rule” in Washington than in heeding the Declaration of Independence’s insistence that government rules “with the consent of the governed.” Recent polling shows only 34 percent of Americans support the healthcare reform legislation making its way through the halls of Congress and 61 percent oppose it, but the Democratic leadership has remained undeterred in the face of popular opposition. Special: Get Sarah Palin’s New Book – Incredible FREE Offer -- Click Here Now. The Democrats have deep divisions among their varying constituencies over issues such as abortion and the public option, but they have a general desire to give the president what he wants. And Bachmann says she believes the bill cannot pass without provisions banning abortion coverage, which are present in the House bill and absent in the Senate legislation. “The president wants the bill, he needs the bill, and he has made all sorts of promises, so that he’ll have one before Christmas,” Bachmann told Newsmax. “And I think the pressure will be unbearable on the Democrats in the Senate ─ perhaps on a few Republicans.” Bachmann says approval for the current incarnation of healthcare reform continues to drop as Americans familiarize themselves with its content. The legislation imposes what she calls an “unconstitutional mandate” that would require those without health insurance to buy it even if they don’t want it. Businesses and individuals that do not buy health insurance would face heavy fines or even face imprisonment. “This will likely become the largest middle-class tax increase in American history,” Bachmann said. “And it will be the next step to socialized medicine.” She says the legislation will dramatically increase health insurance costs in her state. “Some estimates have said that if an individual who lives in Minnesota … went out today to purchase a private health insurance plan with about a $1,000 deductible, that would cost a family about $12,000 a year,” Bachmann said. “However, Speaker Pelosi has very heavy expensive mandates in her healthcare bill. “So take that $12,000 policy in Minnesota and multiply that by a factor of 1.73 ─ Speaker Pelosi’s mandate ─ that could cost an individual up to $20,000.” The Democrats’ healthcare legislation, she says, compounds this increase by limiting subsidies to those families or individuals with incomes under $59,000. Consequently, those making above the limit end up having to purchase an expensive healthcare policy in the private market using after-tax income.” “This is a very expensive burden that we’re putting on the American people,” she said. “In effect, this mandate is a tax, a new health tax on the American people. “It puts a lot of uncertainty into Americans’ lives, and people will need to make a decision. “Do they want to buy healthcare, which they will be forced to do, or do they make their car payment, or do they put their child through college, or do they pay their mortgage?” Should the legislation become law, Americans would have to pay “heavy” taxes to support the program for four years before they would see any healthcare benefits. Bachmann says time still remains for people to contact their senator to voice their opposition to the legislation, but the window for doing so could end before Christmas if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gets his way. A future Republican-controlled Congress would have a difficult time rolling back the legislation if it becomes law unless they enjoy majorities comparable to those currently enjoyed by the Democrats. Bachmann sees that as highly improbable. And a potential lawsuit challenging mandatory health insurance could take as long as five years before reaching the Supreme Court. “This is a really bad bill done very quickly ─ done behind closed doors ─ with virtually zero Republican input,” she said. “The president made a big deal about saying he was going to have all of the healthcare debate out in the open with C-SPAN cameras running. “That hasn’t happened for 10 seconds, and the American people are really steamed about it.” Bachmann also expressed her displeasure with the financial services bill sponsored by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, which recently passed the House in spite of unified Republican opposition and no votes from 27 Democrats. She says the legislation, should it become law, would institutionalize last year’s overwhelmingly unpopular TARP bailouts and give Obama the ability to authorize new bailouts without congressional approval. “It will likely cost in excess of 1 million job losses in the United States, and … you have the takeover of one more industry ─ in this case the financial services industry,” Bachmann said. “Some experts have estimated this would give government control or ownership of 10-15 percent of the economy … on top of the 30 percent of the economy the government has taken ownership or control of.” This past year, she says, will be remembered as “the year of the government takeover of private industry.” “Barney Frank and financial-service meltdown has been synonymous,” Bachmann said. “If you [want to] look at the architect of ruin of our financial meltdown, you have to look at the banking chairman, Chris Dodd of Conn., and Barney Frank, our chairman from the state of Mass.’ Bachmann says Frank has consistently been “an apologist” for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the now government-owned secondary mortgage lenders that have been at the “epicenter” of the financial services crisis. “The federal government has said, ‘Take all the risks you want; make all the bad loans you want,’” Bachmann said. “That’s Freddie and Fannie, and now the federal government has taken the worst of the financial meltdown, and they’ve institutionalized it.” However, she takes heart from the defeat of House legislation that would have allowed a judge to unilaterally rewrite the terms of mortgage loans. Bachmann says it would have been “insanity” to allow that to happen at a time of serious financial instability. She also told Martella Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez’ bill aimed at legalizing the millions of illegal immigrants in the United States further shows the Democrats don’t want to listen to the American people. The same legislation was overwhelmingly opposed by the public the last time it came up for a vote in 2007.",http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/bachmann-healthcare-taxes-abortion/2009/12/16/id/343543/,
The health care law imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/health-care-law-largest-tax-increase-history-middl/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,The Biggest Tax Increase in History,"Republicans say that Bill Clinton imposed the biggest tax increase in American history. Democrats disagree, saying Dole himself is responsible for the biggest tax increase in history: a massive tax bill he engineered as Senate Finance Committee chairman in 1982. Who's right? The answer turns on so many metaphysical questions as to be nearly meaningless. Nevertheless, the issue will be central to the fall campaign.The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) fashioned by Dole and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) pushed through Congress by Clinton were projected, at the time of passage, to raise almost exactly the same amounts of revenue. The Dole measure was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to increase the Treasury's take over the next five years by $235 billion. The revenue parts of Clinton's bill were projected to produce $241 billion over five years. But these numbers need to be adjusted.Inflation between 1982 and 1993, as measured by the GDP deflator, eroded the value of the dollar by almost a third. Measured in 1982 dollars, Clinton's tax increase would be worth only about $165 billion--$70 billion less than Dole's.On the other hand, most of Dole's tax increase was actually the partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in 1981 but had not yet taken place. Despite Dole's bill, taxpayers received more than $375 billion in tax cuts over the following three years. (This did not deter Dole's supply-side critics, led by Jack Kemp, from characterizing his bill as a record-setting tax boost.) Whether repeal of a future tax cut counts as a tax increase is a metaphysical question. If the answer is no, Clinton's tax increase is larger.Republicans charge that Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut and delivered a tax increase instead. That is not quite right. A promise to increase taxes on the affluent was, in fact, a central feature of Clinton's 1992 campaign. And almost two-thirds (63 percent) of the projected revenues in Clinton's tax increase hit high-income couples (over $140,000 a year) and individuals (over $115,000). Most of this came from an increase in the top income-tax rate. Another 15 percent of Clinton's revenue came from tax increases on business, primarily a rise in the corporate income-tax rate and new limits on the deduction for entertainment expenses. These also were campaign promises made and kept, not broken. (By interesting contrast, a full 70 percent of Dole's increased revenues came from business, primarily in the form of closing loopholes and ending special favors included in the 1981 tax-cut bill. Clinton's bill, while raising business taxes somewhat overall, introduced a variety of special business preferences.)Clinton also reduced the income-tax exclusion for Social Security payments to retirees with incomes above $44,000 per couple ($34,000 for individuals). Whether increasing the portion of a government benefit check that the government reclaims in taxes amounts to a payment reduction or a tax increase is another metaphysical question. So is the issue of whether a couple earning $44,000--about one-and-a-half times the median family income--in retirement counts as affluent.Clinton's 1993 bill increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for millions of low-income workers. Clintonites wish to count this as a Clinton tax cut. The EITC is supposed to help relieve the burden of payroll taxes (Social Security, Medicare), and is refundable (paid in cash) to workers who owe less in income tax than the tax credit is worth. Whether a government check intended to mitigate a tax burden amounts to a tax cut or a spending increase is yet another metaphysical question.The only part of the 1993 tax bill that directly affected middle-income families was a 4.3-cent-per-gallon boost in the gasoline tax. This cost the average family $45 a year and accounted for less than 10 percent of the total revenue raised. Nevertheless, it was a middle-class tax increase, not a middle-class tax cut. (Although Dole's 1982 act didn't raise gas taxes, only a few months later, Congress enacted a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax with Dole's and President Reagan's approval.)One last metaphysical question. Almost $50 billion of Dole's 1982 projected revenue was supposed to come from cracking down on tax cheats, by adding staff to the IRS, and requiring financial institutions to withhold interest and dividends the way employers withhold wages. (This provision was repealed the next year, before it could take effect.) Is getting people to pay taxes they already owe but would otherwise escape a tax increase? In 1982, Bob Dole probably would have said of course not. In 1996, though, Dole has called the IRS an intrusive, oppressive presence in American life, and has pledged to cut its staff of investigators. Clinton, meanwhile, has already announced that 5,000 IRS jobs will be eliminated, with more layoffs to come.Campaign assertions about how much the average family's taxes have increased under Clinton should be regarded with suspicion. (a) Averages obscure the fact that most of Clinton's tax increase did fall on the affluent. The typical middle-class family paid only the new gas tax. (b) Most of the increased tax revenue from individuals reflects higher income, not higher tax rates. (c) As a share of GDP, government now takes 40 cents on the dollar. Rep. Susan Molinari used this figure in her Republican Convention keynote address to illustrate the burden of Clinton's tax increase. But the increase in this figure is due entirely to the rise in state and local taxes. As a share of GDP, federal taxes have been roughly stable under Clinton.",http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html,

A 156 percent increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco: On February 4, 2009, just sixteen days into his Administration, Obama signed into law a 156 percent increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco, a hike of 61 cents per pack. The median income of smokers is just over $36,000 per year.2. Obamacare Individual Mandate Excise Tax (takes effect in Jan 2014): Starting in 2014, anyone not buying “qualifying” health insurance – as defined by Obama-appointed HHS bureaucrats -- must pay an income surtax according to the higher of the following:The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that six million American families will be liable for the tax, and as Americans for Tax Reform has pointed out, 100 percent of Americans filing a tax return (140 million filers) will be forced to submit paperwork to the IRS showing they had “qualifying” health insurance for every month of the tax year. Bill: PPACA; Page: 317-337)3. Obamacare Employer Mandate Tax (takes effect Jan. 2014): If an employer does not offer health coverage, and at least one employee qualifies for a health tax credit, the employer must pay an additional non-deductible tax of $2000 for all full-time employees. Applies to all employers with 50 or more employees. If any employee actually receives coverage through the exchange, the penalty on the employer for that employee rises to $3000. If the employer requires a waiting period to enroll in coverage of 30-60 days, there is a $400 tax per employee ($600 if the period is 60 days or longer). Bill: PPACA; Page: 345-3464. Obamacare Surtax on Investment Income (Tax hike of $123 billion/takes effect Jan. 2013): Creation of a new, 3.8 percent surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single). This would result in the following top tax rates on investment income: Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 87-93*Other unearned income includes (for surtax purposes) gross income from interest, annuities, royalties, net rents, and passive income in partnerships and Subchapter-S corporations. It does not include municipal bond interest or life insurance proceeds, since those do not add to gross income. It does not include active trade or business income, fair market value sales of ownership in pass-through entities, or distributions from retirement plans. The 3.8% surtax does not apply to non-resident aliens.5. Obamacare Excise Tax on Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans (Tax hike of $32 bil/takes effect Jan. 2018): Starting in 2018, new 40 percent excise tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans ($10,200 single/$27,500 family). Higher threshold ($11,500 single/$29,450 family) for early retirees and high-risk professions. CPI +1 percentage point indexed. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,941-1,9566. Obamacare Hike in Medicare Payroll Tax (Tax hike of $86.8 bil/takes effect Jan. 2013): Current law and changes:7. Obamacare Medicine Cabinet Tax (Tax hike of $5 bil/took effect Jan. 2011): Americans are no longer able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin). Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,957-1,9598. Obamacare HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike (Tax hike of $1.4 bil/took effect Jan. 2011): Increases additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,9599. Obamacare Flexible Spending Account Cap – aka “Special Needs Kids Tax” (Tax hike of $13 bil/takes effect Jan. 2013): Imposes cap on FSAs of $2500 (currently unlimited).

There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United States, and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education. Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs children in Washington, D.C. (National Child Research Center) can easily exceed $14,000 per year. Under tax rules, FSA dollars can be used to pay for this type of special needs education.

The health care law imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/health-care-law-largest-tax-increase-history-middl/,False,Can not judge,Can not judge,False,Can not judge,Can not judge,,Repealing Obamacare is A Giant Middle Class Tax Cut,"Congressional Republicans have vowed that one of their first acts next year will be to send legislation repealing Obamacare to the desk of President-elect Donald Trump.Doing so will not only repeal a failed law that has resulted in skyrocketing premiums, cancelled healthcare plans, and billions in new, wasteful spending, it will also provide a giant tax cut to middle class Americans.Obamacare imposed roughly one trillion in higher taxes over ten years that directly or indirectly hit middle class families and businesses.Repealing these taxes will provide much needed relief to the paychecks of families across the country.Repealing Obamacare will also undo Barack Obama’s broken promise not to sign “any form of tax increase” on any American making less than $250,000.Anyone not buying “qualifying” health insurance – as defined by President Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services -- must pay an income surtax to the IRS. In 2014, close to 7.5 million households paid this tax. Most make less than $250,000. The Obama administration uses the Orwellian phrase “shared responsibility payment” to describe this tax.Starting this year, the tax was a minimum of $695 for individuals, while families of four had to pay a minimum of $2,085.A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that repealing this tax would decrease spending by $311 billion over ten years.In addition to mandating the purchase of health insurance through the individual mandate tax, Obamacare directly increases the cost of insurance through the health insurance tax. The tax is projected to cost taxpayers – including those in the middle class – $130 billion over the next decade.The total revenue this tax collects is set annually by Treasury and is then divided amongst insurers relative to the premiums collected from certain plans each year. While it is directly levied on the industry, the costs of the Obamacare health insurance tax are inevitably passed on to small businesses that provide healthcare to their employees, middle class families through higher premiums, seniors who purchase Medicare advantage coverage, and the poor who rely on Medicaid managed care.According to the American Action Forum, the Obamacare health insurance tax will increase premiums by up to $5,000 over a decade and will directly impact 1.7 million small businesses, 11 million households that purchase through the individual insurance market and 23 million households covered through their jobs. The tax is also economically destructive – the National Federation for Independent Businesses estimates the tax could cost up to 286,000 in new jobs and cost small businesses $33 billion in lost sales by 2023.Medicine Cabinet Tax on HSAs and FSAs ($6.7 billion tax hike between 2016-2025)Since 2011 millions of Americans are no longer able to purchase over-the-counter medicines using pre-tax Flexible Spending Accounts or Health Savings Accounts dollars. Examples include cold, cough, and flu medicine, menstrual cramp relief medication, allergy medicines, and dozens of other common medicine cabinet health items. This tax costs FSA and HSA users $6.7 billion over ten years.The 30 - 35 million Americans who use a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family’s basic medical needs face an Obamacare-imposed cap of $2,500. This tax will hit Americans $32 billion over the next ten years.The 30 - 35 million Americans who use a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family’s basic medical needs face an Obamacare-imposed cap of $2,500. This tax will hit Americans $32 billion over the next ten years.Before Obamacare, the accounts were unlimited under federal law, though employers were allowed to set a cap. Now, parents looking to sock away extra money to pay for braces find themselves quickly hitting this new cap, meaning they have to pony up some or all of the cost with after-tax dollars. Needless to say, this tax especially impacts middle class families.There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap is particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children.  Families with special needs children often use FSAs to pay for special needs education. Tuition rates at special needs schools can run thousands of dollars per year. Under tax rules, FSA dollars can be used to pay for this type of special needs education. This Obamacare tax increase limits the options available to these families.This income tax increase directly targets middle class Americans with high medical bills. The tax hits 10 million households every year. Before Obamacare, Americans facing high medical expenses were allowed an income tax deduction to the extent that those expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). Obamacare now imposes a threshold of 10 percent of AGI. Therefore, Obamacare not only makes it more difficult to claim this deduction, it widens the net of taxable income. This income tax increase will cost Americans $40 billion over the next ten years.According to the IRS, approximately 10 million families took advantage of this tax deduction each year before Obamacare. Almost all were middle class: The average taxpayer claiming this deduction earned just over $53,000 annually in 2010. ATR estimates that the average income tax increase for the average family claiming this tax benefit is about $200 - $400 per year.In 2020, a new 40 percent excise tax on employer provided health insurance plans is scheduled to kick in, on plans exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. According to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Cadillac tax will hit 26 percent of employer provided plans and 42 percent of employer provided plans by 2028. Over time, this will decrease care and increase costs for millions of American families across the country.This provision increases the tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.The Obamacare 10 percent tanning tax has wiped out an estimated 10,000 tanning salons, many owned by women. This $800 million Obamacare tax increase was the first to go into effect (July 2010). This petty, burdensome, nanny-state tax affects both the business owner and the end user. Industry estimates show that 30 million Americans visit an indoor tanning facility in a given year, and over 50 percent of salon owners are women. There is no exception granted for those making less than $250,000 meaning it is yet another tax that violates Obama’s “firm pledge” not to raise “any form” of tax on Americans making less than this amount.",https://www.atr.org/repealing-obamacare-giant-middle-class-tax-cut,

This year he has the opportunity to do so multiple times.Most notably, Trump in the White House means that comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform is now a priority in the first hundred days of the new administration.But this is not the first tax cut Congress will send to Trump’s desk. By passing legislation repealing ObamaCare through budget reconciliation, lawmakers have an opportunity to remove nearly 20 taxes which will save taxpayers more than one trillion dollars over the next decade.Repealing these taxes is a huge win for middle class taxpayers, who were hit with an avalanche of tax increases despite Barack Obama’s “firm pledge” not to sign “any form of tax increase” on any American making less than $250,000.The trillion dollars in higher taxes have restricted health care choice, increased costs, made saving more difficult, and granted government more control over care at the expense of individual control. Below are just some of the tax wins that will come from repealing ObamaCare:ObamaCare enforces many of its provisions through stiff tax penalties both on individuals and on businesses.Any individual that fails to purchase “qualifying” health insurance – as defined by President Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services – must pay an income surtax totaling more than $2,000 for a family of four. Close to 7.5 million households paid this tax – which the Obama administration refers to with the Orwellian name “shared responsibility payment.” Most make less than $250,000.Similarly, the law forces employers to pay a $2,000 penalty per full time employee if that fail to offer qualifying insurance. This mandate increases taxes on businesses by $166.9 billion over a decade.At the same time ObamaCare mandates insurance coverage, it directly drives up the cost of that insurance through a massive tax totaling $130 billion over the next decade. This tax is borne by small businesses, individuals and families through higher premiums.The ObamaCare health insurance tax will increase premiums by up to $5,000 per family over a decade, according to the American Action Forum. The tax will directly impact 1.7 million small businesses, 11 million households that purchase through the individual insurance market and 23 million households covered through their jobs.The tax could cost up to 286,000 new jobs, and $33 billion in lost sales by 2023, according to research by the National Federation for Independent Businesses.This is just one of the many ObamaCare taxes that drives up health care costs. The law imposes billions of dollars more in taxes on prescription medicine and medical devices, and imposes a 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided insurance that will hit more than 40 percent of plans within a decade.People -- not businesses – bear the burden of these taxes, so this is billions of dollars in higher taxes that are passed on to consumers who rely on life-saving and life-bettering products.In addition to increasing the costs of health care through higher prices and stifling mandates, ObamaCare directly increases taxes on Americans with high medical bills.Prior to passage of ObamaCare, Americans facing high out of pocket medical expenses were allowed an income tax deduction to the extent that those expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). The law increased this threshold to 10 percent of AGI, making it more difficult for families to claim this deduction and widening the net of taxable income.Around 10 million families used this deduction before ObamaCare, with the average taxpayer earning just $53,000 in 2010. Based on this information, the average family is paying $200 to $400 in higher income taxes each year.ObamaCare imposed several taxes that hit the tens of millions of Americans who use Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts. Specifically, the law forbid families from using HSA and FSA dollars for over the counter medications. Families had been making such household medicine cabinet purchases for years – cold and flu medicine and hundreds of other medical products. ObamaCare also hikes taxes on FSAs by imposing a cap ($2,500) on the amount of income families can contribute to FSAs and increases the tax penalty on early withdrawals from HSAs.These tax-preferred savings accounts are used in conjunction with insurance plans, which tend to cover large and/or unexpected health events and allow individuals to make choices that best fit their needs. Expanding and protecting these savings accounts is one component to ensuring Americans have access to patient centered health care that best fits their needs and keeps costs low. Repealing these taxes will take power away from the federal government and increase the choices available to consumers.Since it was passed into law in 2010, ObamaCare has resulted in greater costs, less choice, and higher taxes. By voting to repeal ObamaCare, lawmakers are taking step one toward lower taxes for American families and businesses across the board.Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.

Lawmakers from both parties are wary that the White House hasn’t said how it would pay for the cuts, which likely would provide the greatest benefits to higher-income earners and corporations.At its center is a large reduction in corporate tax rates, to 15% — from multinational corporations to mom-and-pop shops. The current U.S. corporate tax rate is 35%, the highest among developed economies, but many companies pay a lower rate by using deductions in the tax code.The plan also reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 10%, 25% and a top rate of 35%.The outline released by the White House lacks many basic details, including income requirements pegged to new tax brackets, any explanation of a new tax break for childcare expenses, or any analysis of how much it would increase the national debt.Among the deductions it would eliminate would be one for the payment of state and local taxes. That would be a big hit to Californians and residents of other states with high taxes and high earners.The proposal also would eliminate the inheritance tax on multi-million-dollar estates and cut a 3.8% tax on investment income imposed as part of Obamacare.It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, a backstop intended to prevent the highest earners from using deductions and other strategies to avoid paying substantial taxes. The alternative minimum tax increasingly forces upper-middle-class earners to pay more taxes because it doesn't adjust for inflation.It also would impose an undefined one-time tax on corporate profits held overseas in an attempt to bring the money back to U.S. operations.In an attempt to simplify, the plan would eliminate most deductions used by higher earners, but would preserve those for charitable giving and home loans, among the costliest and most popular. It would also double the standard deduction, which currently is $12,700 for a married couple filing jointly.“This tax reform package is about growing the economy, creating jobs,” said Gary Cohn, director of Trump’s National Economic Council, who presented the plan at the White House briefing with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.The plan is sure to meet resistance and refinement on Capitol Hill, among Democrats who oppose heavy tax breaks for high earners and corporate interests, Republicans who worry about the deficit, and lobbying interests concerned with the potential loss of favored deductions.Democrats and some outside groups also complained that the proposal would chiefly benefit wealthy Americans like Trump personally, rather than middle-class wage earners.In response to a question, Mnuchin said Trump had no intention of releasing his tax returns, further slamming the door on a dispute that has persisted since the campaign, when the billionaire businessman became the first major presidential candidate since the 1970s to refuse to let voters see how much he pays in taxes and details about his business deals and investments.But Trump and his advisors cast it as a historic and long-overdue opportunity to rewrite tax laws that have grown increasingly complicated since the last major rewrite in 1986 under President Reagan.“This isn't going to be easy. Doing big things never is,” Cohn said. “We will be attacked from the left and we'll be attacked from the right, but one thing is certain: I would never, ever bet against this president. He will get this done for the American people.”If the plan does not pay for itself, it would need support from at least some Democrats under current Senate rules. Some were quick to denounce it on Wednesday.Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the proposal “an unprincipled tax plan that will result in cuts for the 1%, conflicts for the president, crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people.”Republican leaders in the House have worked for years on their own plans, which now include a smaller tax break for companies – a drop to 20% for corporations and a maximum of 25% for pass-through companies.Their plan also depends on a border adjustment tax to bring in $1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years to help recover the cost of the lower rates.That tax would subject importers, including retailers, to higher taxes and produce breaks for companies that export. The proposal has split the business community.Mnuchin said the administration likes some aspects of the border tax but is not backing it now.“We will be working very closely… with the House and the Senate to turn this into a bill that can be passed and the president can sign,” he said of the administration proposal. “And there's lots and lots of details that will go into how that will pay for itself.”Republican leaders on Capitol Hill issued a joint statement Wednesday that fell short of an endorsement but said Trump’s outline will “serve as critical guideposts for Congress.”Trump’s advisors argued that the plan will pay for itself through economic growth. But most economists dispute that analysis, which could put Trump at odds with long-held Republican promises to trim the deficit.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that Trump's campaign tax plan, which includes eliminating the alternative minimum tax and other changes along with the tax cut to corporations proposed Wednesday, would reduce federal revenue by $7.2 trillion over the first decade.Marc Short, Trump’s director of legislative affairs, was deliberately vague on that point during a meeting with reporters this week, saying the administration did not intend to order an analysis of the plan’s deficit impact at this stage.",http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-tax-20170426-story.html,

You hear it from Fox News and the rest of the right wing media in their interviews, their commentary, and their “news” reports. It doesn’t seem to bother any of them that they have no inhibitions about consciously repeating what they know to be one lie after another.  Arguably, one of the most egregious lies is that President Obama is taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund ObamaCare. This statement is not only a lie – it is the complete reversal of the truth, and Paul Ryan and the other prevaricators are very aware that this is a made up fact that has been culled from a half-truth stood on its ear and fashioned into something completely the opposite of the reality. Simply put, the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is the law of the land. For better or for worse, it was passed by the United States Congress. One positive provision of ObamaCare is the about $700 billion has been saved by the elimination of waste, fraud, and overpayments. This is a good thing, no? Even better, the President saw to it that most of this money will be applied to closing the donut hole and other reforms that will put significant dollars into the pocketbooks of seniors. Ironically, Paul Ryan casually omits that his financial plan retains the existing $700 billion savings wrought by the Affordable Care Act – and the Ryan plan directs that sum to offset additional tax cuts for the wealthy. Compare these facts to the Republican oratory and it is clear that what they say and what they mean to do are mirror opposites. Let’s look more deeply some other aspects of this issue: Health care spending has consumed an increasing share of economic activity over time. Health care grows faster than most other sectors of the economy and thus its share of economic activity has increased year by year. The United States spent $2.6 trillion on health care in 2010. Spread over the population, this amounts to $8,402 per person. The Obama administration's Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is designed to bring health care costs under control. Passed in 2010, the law is also meant to help more people get affordable health insurance coverage, including an estimated 50 million uninsured today.  The median U.S. family income is about $50,000. Employer subsidized family health coverage can easily run to $20,000 a year. That shared cost represents an insurance premium paid to a private company in exchange for health insurance. It is obviously not a tax paid to the government. At first glance, the example above may seem to show that 40 percent of the median employee’s income goes to health coverage. In reality it’s much less because the employer’s share is a benefit to the worker, rather than salary. You hear it from Governor Romney on the stump.

The GOP propaganda machine took the opportunity to mischaracterize and broadcast the mandate as a 40% tax increase on the family. They say that this phantom tax increase “is required by law”! Rush Limbaugh called the law the largest tax increase in the history of the world. In a column on Forbes.com, a similar opinion was written by Merrill Matthews of the Institute for Policy Innovation, a think tank founded by Tea Party honcho and former Republican U.S. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. The health care law imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.” echoed super-PAC American Commitment, which is quoted from its website that it supports free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom. As a 501(c)4 it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. Part of the act, the individual mandate, will require nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face a financial penalty. The individual mandate will help spread health care costs amongst a larger pool of individuals, thus potentially lowering costs. The ACA creates state-based Health Insurance Exchanges administered by a governmental agency or non-profit organization, through which individuals and small businesses with up to 100 employees can purchase qualified coverage.   In 2014 and beyond, most Americans who work for small businesses or obtain their coverage in the individual health insurance market will do so through health insurance exchanges. There will be no penalty for those who can't afford insurance, including those who don't make enough to file federal taxes or whose insurance premiums will cost more than 8% of their household income. Workers who earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level will get subsidies if they don't have employer-provided insurance. Those who aren't exempt or who don't have employer- or government-provided insurance and refuse to buy their own will begin to pay fines in 2014. Those fines will be due with income taxes the following April.  Look, ObamaCare is not perfect, but on balance it is a first step forward. Presidents of both parties have been trying unsuccessfully to get a health care bill past one reluctant Congress after another for decades. To the President’s credit he massaged an imperfect bill through Congress as a first step towards real universal health care. Along the way, almost every Republican and a small number of Blue Dog Democrats did whatever they could to poison the Bill, and they succeeded to a large extent.   With that said, the Bill that finally emerged has so many good points, such as saving $700 billion in unnecessary expenses and using the money to help seniors, that it is a good starting point. Give the President a second term and give him a Democratic Congress and we will see significant reform and improvement of this vital Bill.",http://www.therationalmajority.org/snap-facts/snapfact293-presidentobamagaveusobamacare-gopfalseclaimsringhollow,

The Truth: Reports tens of thousands fraudulent Hillary Clinton were found in an Ohio warehouse appear to be false — but authorities in Ohio have launched an official investigation into the rumor. The rumor started with a story that appeared at Christian Times Newspaper (not to be confused with the reputable Christian Times publication), under the headline, “BREAKING: ‘Tens of Thousands’ of Fraudulent Clinton Votes Found in Ohio Warehouse,” that reports: Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week. According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates. “No one really goes in this building. It’s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,” Prince said. So when Prince, who is a Trump supporter, saw several black boxes in an otherwise empty room, he went to investigate. What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state. Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October 12, so no votes have officially been cast in the Buckeye state.  However, inside these boxes were, what one source described as, “potentially tens of thousands of votes” for Hillary Clinton. A photo accompanying the story shows Prince posing behind a stack of the black cartons marked “ballot box” that he supposedly found in the Ohio warehouse. However, those black boxes can easily be identified as the ballot boxes used in England, not in the U.S. And the photo of the man posing behind the ballot boxes was taken from a stock photo website called Alamy. The site has additional photos of the ballot boxes and the man with the caption, “Ballot Boxes being delivered to Sheldon Heath community centre ready for voting in General Election.” So, clearly the photo used in the Christian Times Newspaper story does not show ballot boxes found in an Ohio warehouse. Christian Times Newspaper has a knack for publishing fake news stories that appear to be real. Its name is so similar to the reputable Christian Times site, which often creates confusion among readers. We previously investigated previous false reports from the site that all 4th of July fireworks displays had been canceled due to terrorism fears, that Donald Trump had been removed from primary ballots in five states, and that Russian hacker “Guccifer” was found dead in his jail cell after hacking Clinton’s email sever. When it comes to the Clinton election fraud story, the Christian Times Newspaper story was so believable that it sparked an investigation among elections officials in Franklin County, Ohio, an NBC affiliate reports: The Franklin County Board of Elections says that a preliminary investigation shows that the article is fake, and the photo portrayed as the worker standing with the ballot boxes was lifted from a2015 article in the Birmingham Post, an English newspaper, and altered slightly, with some of the ballot boxes repositioned and resized, and some of the labels blurred out. Elections officials would like to remind everyone that absentee voting in the state does not start until Oct. 12. The Board of Elections says that no ballots have been printed or mailed, except for those that were requested by members of the military and US citizens who live abroad. The Board of Elections also has several security measures in place to help uphold the integrity of the electoral process: -The computer system used to create the ballot and tabulate results is not connected to an outside network and thus is not vulnerable to outside intrusion. -Each ballot storage vault is maintained under a double lock requiring a Democrat and Republican to simultaneously unlock -A double lock system is used to secure the Vote Center and must be unlocked by a Democrat and Republican simultaneously. -Both parties are required to sign a chain of custody for all mailed ballots delivered to or picked up from the USPS. -Access to sensitive ballot storage areas are secured by keys that are maintained in storage containers requiring palm scan access. -Votes are recorded in three ways (1) in a hard drive within the voting machine, (2) on the removable voting machine data card, and (3) on a paper tape inside the voting machine. -When the vote is counted, it’s done in a public setting which can be observed by parties, any campaign, the media, and the public. Given that Christian Times Newspaper is known for publishing false reports, that a photo used in the story actually shows an elections worker delivering ballots in England, and that Franklin County, Ohio, elections workers looked into the report, we’re calling reports that tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton ballots were found “fiction.”",https://www.truthorfiction.com/thousands-of-fraudulent-clinton-votes-found-in-ohio-warehouse/,

Ohio, a perennial swing state in the presidential election, has been a challenge for Clinton and her Democrat counterparts in 2016.  Many national Democrat groups have pulled funding from the state entirely, in order to redirect it to places in which they are doing better. Clinton herself has spent less time in Ohio, and spent less money, in recent weeks as it has appeared that Trump will carry the crucial state.

But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue.","From Headline to Photograph, a Fake News Masterpiece","ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It was early fall, and Donald J. Trump, behind in the polls, seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose. “I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,” the Republican nominee told a riled-up crowd in Columbus, Ohio. He was hearing “more and more” about evidence of rigging, he added, leaving the details to his supporters’ imagination. A few weeks later, Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash, sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out. In a dubious art just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece. Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline: “BREAKING: ‘Tens of thousands’ of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.” It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his “rigged” meme. “I had a theory when I sat down to write it,” recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. “Given the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump’s talking points people would click. Trump was saying ‘rigged election, rigged election.’ People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating.” In a raucous election year defined by made-up stories, Mr. Harris was a home-grown, self-taught practitioner, a boutique operator with no ties to Russian spy agencies or Macedonian fabrication factories. As Mr. Trump takes office this week, the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery, Mr. Harris and his ersatz-news website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, make for an illuminating tale. Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked. “This topic is rather sensitive,” Mr. Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully.  At his kitchen table that night in September, Mr. Harris wondered: Who might have found these fraudulent Clinton ballots? So he invented “Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker.” This Everyman, a “Trump supporter” whose name hinted at a sort of nobility, had entered a little-used back room at the warehouse and stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots pre-marked for Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Harris decided. “No one really goes in this building. It’s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,” Prince said. In case anyone missed the significance of the find, Mr. Harris made it plain: “What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.” A photograph, he thought, would help erase doubts about his yarn. With a quick Google image search for “ballot boxes,” he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had “Ballot Box” labels. It was a photo from The Birmingham Mail, showing a British election 3,700 miles from Columbus — but no matter. In the caption, the balding Briton got a new name: “Mr. Prince, shown here, poses with his find, as election officials investigate.” The article explained that “the Clinton campaign’s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.” Then Mr. Harris added a touch of breathlessness. “This story is still developing,” he wrote, “and CTN will bring you more when we have it.” He pushed the button and the story was launched on Sept. 30, blazing across the web like some kind of counterfeit comet. “Even before I posted it, I knew it would take off,” Mr. Harris recalled. He was correct. The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Mr. Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Mrs. Clinton was going to cheat Mr. Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof. It was eventually shared with six million people, according to CrowdTangle, which tracks web audiences.  The next day, the Franklin County, Ohio, board of elections announced that it was investigating and that the fraud claims appeared to be untrue. Within days, Ohio’s secretary of state, Jon Husted, issued a statement to deny the story. “A Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,” Mr. Husted said. There was nothing especially Christian about his efforts, Mr. Harris admits; he had simply bought the abandoned web address for $5 at ExpiredDomains.net. Within a few days, the story, which had taken him 15 minutes to concoct, had earned him about $5,000. That was a sizable share of the $22,000 an accounting statement shows he made during the presidential campaign from ads for shoes, hair gel and web design that Google had placed on his site. He had put in perhaps half an hour a week on the fake news site, he said, for a total of about 20 hours. He would come close to a far bigger payday, one that might have turned the $5 he had spent on the Christian Times domain into more than $100,000. The money, not the politics, was the point, he insisted. He had graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in May, and he needed to pay his living expenses. “I spent the money on student loans, car payments and rent,” he said. By the time he launched his fraudulent story on ballot fraud, he had found minimal success with “Hillary Clinton Blames Racism for Cincinnati Gorilla’s Death,” a reference to the sad tale of Harambe, the gorilla shot after he grabbed a little boy visiting the zoo. He had done better with “Early Morning Explosion in DC Allegedly Leaves Yet Another DNC Staffer Dead,” spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a Democratic National Committee staff member. Later, he would tell gullible readers “NYPD Looking to Press Charges Against Bill Clinton for Underage Sex Ring,” “Protesters Beat Homeless Veteran to Death in Philadelphia” and “Hillary Clinton Files for Divorce in New York Courts.” Eight of his stories would merit explicit debunking by Snopes.com, the myth-busting site, but none would top the performance of the ballot box fantasy. President Obama thought the fake news phenomenon significant enough to mention it as a threat to democracy in his farewell speech in Chicago last week. “Increasingly,” he said, “we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it’s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.”  That was exactly the insight on which Mr. Harris said he built his transient business: that people wanted to be fed evidence, however implausible, to support their beliefs. “At first it kind of shocked me — the response I was getting,” he said. “How easily people would believe it. It was almost like a sociological experiment,” added Mr. Harris, who majored in political science and economics. By his account, though he voted for Mr. Trump, his early preference had been for Senator Marco Rubio. Mr. Harris said he would have been willing to promote Mrs. Clinton and smear Mr. Trump had those tactics been lucrative. But as other seekers of clicks discovered, Mr. Trump’s supporters were far more fervent than Mrs. Clinton’s. In late October, with the inevitable end of his venture approaching, Mr. Harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web’s top 20,000 sites. An appraiser said that given the traffic, he could probably sell it for between $115,000 and $125,000. But Mr. Harris made a costly mistake: He decided to wait. Days after the election, denounced for making the peddling of fake news remunerative, Google announced that it would no longer place ads on sites promoting clearly fabricated stories. A few days later, when Mr. Harris checked his site, the ads were gone. He checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless. All was not lost, however. He had put a pop-up on the site inviting visitors to “join the ‘Stop the Steal’ team to find out HOW Hillary plans to steal the election and what YOU can do to stop her!” and collected 24,000 email addresses. He has not yet decided what to do with them, he said. Asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate, Mr. Harris grew thoughtful. But he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations, half-truths and outright whoppers, so he was hardly adding much to the sum total. “Hardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true,” he said. Lately he has picked up Mr. Trump’s refrain that mainstream news organizations are themselves regular purveyors of fake news. Last week, when BuzzFeed released what it called an “explosive but unverified” dossier suggesting that Russia had planned to bribe and blackmail Mr. Trump, Mr. Harris wrote on Twitter: He did not mention his own expertise in the field. Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the origin of a widely shared fake news story misstated a Twitter post by Cameron Harris, a 23-year-old Maryland man who created the article and the website on which it originated. Mr. Harris, quoting BuzzFeed’s description of a dossier on alleged Russian attempts to win influence over Donald J. Trump, wrote: “ ‘Explosive but unverified’ — That could describe every fake news headline ever.” His Twitter post did not say, “He did not mention his own expertise in the field.” (That was the last sentence of the Times article, referring to Mr. Harris.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/fake-news-hillary-clinton-cameron-harris.html,

[RELATED: Fresh out of Davidson College, he pulled off a fake-news stunner] Maryland lawmaker David Vogt III, R-Frederick, told The Washington Post he terminated Harris “on the spot” after learning he was the mastermind behind the fake news. “I was shocked to hear that he could do such a thing,” Vogt told the newspaper on Wednesday night. “He seemed like a bright young man that was interested in getting involved in politics.” Harris, who graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in May, had worked for the Republican delegate since June. He did not return a call for comment, but he apologized in a Twitter post to “those disappointed by my actions” and called for a “larger dialogue about how Americans approach the media” and other issues. With Donald Trump behind in the polls in early fall, Harris sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment and created a fake story that was eventually shared with 6 million people, The New York Times reported. Harris started by crafting the headline: “BREAKING: ‘Tens of thousands’ of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse,” according to The New York Times, which broke the story on Wednesday about what Harris had done.  President-elect Donald Trump during a press conference on Wednesday refused to answer a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta, and called BuzzFeed a 'failing pile of garbage' after being asked about a controversial memo that Russia has been blackmailing him.  It made sense, Harris told The Times, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Trump had highlighted his “rigged” meme. “I had a theory when I sat down to write it,” Harris told The Times. “Given the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump’s talking points people would click. Trump was saying ‘rigged election, rigged election.’ People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating.” Harris is a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader, who graduated from Davidson College in May, according to The New York Times. A Facebook page for Harris shows he’s from Kings Mountain and went to Kings Mountain High School, in Cleveland County. A Davidson Wildcats football roster corroborates that. In a statement, a Davidson college spokesman said the school “works hard to create a culture of trust in which honesty and personal integrity are foundational.” “We hope that these values are instilled for life and we are disappointed when any alumnus falls short,” said Mark Johnson. Harris responded to The New York Times story on Twitter Wednesday night. “While the initial motivation behind launching a fake news site was financially-based, the lesson I learned from the experience is far more important – and it’s one that can’t be covered in a tweet or even a NYT article,” Harris wrote. “There are large-scale changes occurring in America, from where we live and where we work to the people with whom we interact and the lens through which we see the world. America has responded to these changes poorly. Instead of engaging with one another we have withdrawn into the ideological and cultural circles that support the belief systems to which we subscribe. “Fake news flourished during this election cycle because it served the purpose of reinforcing these biases, and it occurred on both sides,” Harris continued. “It catered to predispositions that Americans already held, and while fake news has been widely discussed, the dynamics behind it have largely been ignored. Whether fake news remains prevalent or not (and I hope that it doesn’t), our nation cannot move forward from such a divisive election cycle if we continue to seek comfort in our own beliefs and refuse to challenge our personal world views.”  A man from Salisbury, North Carolina who said he was investigating a conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C fired a gun inside Comet Ping Pong but did not injure anyone, according to police and news report.",http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article127398034.html,

His commission is going there.,"New Hampshire is known for hosting the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. But now, another reputation is gaining steam: as a breeding ground for vote fraud.The state was one of the first targets of Donald Trump’s claims of illegal voting during the 2016 election — he lost the state by a razor-thin margin (fewer than 2,800 votes). Weeks after he defeated Hillary Clinton, Trump claimed without evidence that the state had serious voter fraud and charged that thousands of people from Massachusetts were bused into in the Granite State to vote.Trump's vote fraud panel is coming to New Hampshire on Tuesday for its second public meeting, only days after the commission's vice chairman amplified in an op-ed the president's baseless claims that illegal voting had possibly swayed the election in the state.It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes, the vice chairman, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, wrote on Breitbart last week.He added that it is possible that New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents.Experts countered that there's no evidence of significant fraud.New Hampshire is central to President Trump’s first claim of widespread voter fraud, said Jonathan Brater, counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which examines voting rights issues.“There’s really no evidence of widespread fraud in New Hampshire, but that has not stopped some people from inflating the potential for voter fraud,” he added.The accusation that people have been bused in from nearby states has been around since at least the mid-1990s, said the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Ray Buckley.This is a lie that they have convinced themselves because they have not been able to process that Democrats win in New Hampshire,” Buckley told NBC News. You would think after 20 years of saying it, if it was true, that one of them would have taken a picture of one of the buses. It’s a farce.In the op-ed, Kobach cited driver's license and voter registration data released last week at the request of New Hampshire's Republican House speaker, Shawn Jasper.The data showed that over 6,500 people who voted in last year’s election had out-of-state licenses, which experts said is no evidence of voter fraud. State law allows people with non-New Hampshire driver's licenses to live in the state and vote legally.These are people who had licenses from other states as millions of people do. They might be students and they might be military, David Becker, an election expert, and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said in a statement. There can be no conclusions drawn regarding the driver's licenses.New Hampshire State Rep. Fred Doucette, a Trump supporter, told a local television station that he personally witnessed people exiting cars with Massachusetts license plates and voting at local polling stations during the presidential election.In recent years, the state has passed laws that critics say amount to voter suppression, but advocates argue will tamp down on any improper voting, including a voter ID law and a residency law requiring voters to prove where they live.It’s interesting that they (the vote fraud commission) are visiting a place where President Trump has said that there’s widespread illegal voting, said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who opposed Trump during the 2016 election.I think the state is being used, he added. They have already concluded what they plan to conclude, and these are just show trials that they’re having.New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a Democrat and a member of the vote fraud commission, has repeatedly denied claims of widespread voter fraud in the state.Gardner told a local paper this year, I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-claims-vote-fraud-new-hampshire-his-commission-going-there-n799931,

In January, he said 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally -- allowing Hillary Clinton to win the national popular vote. In February, he said thousands of people had been bused to New Hampshire from Massachusetts to vote illegally in the swing state.None of those claims have been proven. But on Tuesday, Trump's Election Integrity commission is in New Hampshire to look for evidence.The commission, led by Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, has scheduled a series of presentations from long-time advocates for stricter controls on voting. Among them: The Heritage Foundation's Hans von Spakovsky, who plans to highlight egregious examples of voter fraud; and the Crime Prevention Research Center's John Lott Jr., who will advocate background checks for voters.The agenda is light on elections experts who will push back or question the testimony. So Democrats on the panel are preparing rebuttals themselves.It could get a little feisty, said Matthew Dunlap, Maine's secretary of state and a Democratic member of the commission.The connectivity between not updating your driver's license address and voter fraud is like saying if you have money in your wallet, you must have robbed somebody, Dunlap said.He added: I think it's really reckless to make an allegation like that based on how I know licenses are issued around the country and how elections are conducted. It's an amazing leap to make.Democrats have long complained that Republican-backed state laws -- including voter ID laws, limitations on early voting, objecting to same-day voter registration and more -- have a disproportionate impact on poorer voters, city dwellers and older voters who have no need to drive and college students. They regard the entire commission as a sham designed to soothe Trump's ego after his unsubstantiated claims that voter fraud is why he lost the popular vote to Clinton.Donald Trump created this commission because he was humiliated about losing the 2016 popular vote. Then he tapped Kris Kobach, the king of voter suppression, to lead it. Our election process must be secure, fair and transparent, yet Trump and Kobach are using their sham commission to spread the lie of rampant fraud as a Trojan Horse for voter suppression, said Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project.Republicans -- particularly Kobach -- have meanwhile argued that state voting rolls that haven't been scrubbed for former voters who have moved or died have created a system ripe for exploitation.J. Christian Adams, the Public Interest Legal Foundation general counsel who will appear Tuesday, said the organization found 616 instances in New Jersey in which an undocumented immigrant -- most of whom had been up-front about their citizenship status -- had been allowed to register to vote.A limited inquiry found that hundreds of noncitizens are documented throughout voter records, typically because a bureaucrat offered them an application. Some were even asked after presenting a green card. That broken system is propped up by an honor code proven repeatedly to fail, Adams said in a statement.The controversy will kick off before the 10 a.m. ET meeting starts. Jason Kander, the former Missouri secretary of state who has launched the Let America Vote political action committee and chairs a Democratic National Committee voting rights panel, has scheduled a rally and press conference where he is expected to tear into the Kobach-led commission.",http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/12/politics/new-hampshire-trump-voting-election-commission/index.html,

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.(CNN) The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is becoming the very thing it was created to find: something that undermines voter confidence.The voter fraud commission, as it's commonly called, is actually not charged with finding instances of voter fraud, according to the executive order that outlines its purpose. Instead, it is charged with finding most anything that enhances or undermines confidence in the integrity of the voting process and voting system vulnerabilities that could lead to fraud.It seems that charge is broad enough to include facts, rumors, and outright conspiracy theories -- and the latter two seem to be key areas of focus.In the lead up to the commission's meeting in New Hampshire this Tuesday , Kris Kobach, the commission's chairman, penned an op-ed for Breitbart News in which he recycled a legend well known in Massachusetts and New Hampshire politics.It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire's same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes, he wrote. Now there's proof.This proof, he suggests, is data on same-day voter registrations for the 2016 election, which show that around 6,000 of those voters held out-of-state IDs. Kobach argues that the fact that many of these same-day voters still don't have New Hampshire IDs ten months later could be a sign of fraudulent voting.But even in the short time since Kobach's claim, his analysis has not held up to scrutiny.The Washington Post points out that he failed to account for one group of voters that has a reason to hold out of state licenses: college students in New Hampshire who attend from out of state. And indeed, New Hampshire Public Radio found that the towns with the highest rates of voters with out-of-state IDs were college towns.These allegations are nothing new -- they're familiar to anyone who has spent any time in politics in either state. And they've been fueled by politicians such as former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, who claimed that Bay State voters followed him across the border in 2014 when he relocated to New Hampshire for a second run at the Senate. Former Republican Governor Judd Gregg says he remembers hearing the rumors as far back as 2008.Governor Chris Sununu said the same, telling Boston radio host Howie Carr when Massachusetts elections are not very close, they're bussing them in all over the place -- though he later walked back the claim. President Trump also tweeted about the serious voter fraud that had occurred in New Hampshire.Despite all of this, The Washington Post's Monkey Cage blog found no unusual turnout surges in 2016 that might be explained by buses from Massachusetts, and Former New Hampshire GOP chair Fergus Cullen dismissed the claim, calling it as old as buses themselves in an interview with USA Today. It's been made in many elections, he said. But it is completely baseless, completely false.Despite the lack of supporting evidence, the rumor lives on, and that's enough to keep the commission chasing shadows.Indeed, the thought of busloads of itinerant fraudsters certainly fits the bill as something that would undermine confidence in voting. But ironically, the commission is probably doing more to undermine confidence than the rumor itself, with Kobach pushing conspiracy theories through a national megaphone. This, in turn, offers justification for more restrictive voting laws to address the perception the commission is helping to create.Perhaps saddest of all is that there are many ways that actual experts could help boost confidence in the electoral process, making it more fair, equitable, and transparent. With the growing threat of systemic hacking, along with gerrymandering, voter suppression, and ballot access challenges, which limit Americans' ability to cast their votes, there are some very real issues that threaten our elections and our democracy that need attention.By ignoring these much larger threats and focusing instead on unproven campaign gossip, the commission is missing an opportunity to reassure voters that our elections are fair and protected. So if Kobach wants to find what's undermining voters' confidence in voting, he need only look in a mirror.",http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/11/opinions/new-hampshire-voter-fraud-opinion-koczela/index.html,

(Reuters) - A Democratic member of President Donald Trump’s commission to investigate possible voter fraud defended his participation on the panel on Tuesday while warning that its mission is being threatened by “extreme partisanship.”Dozens of protesters gathered before the second meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity’s in Manchester, New Hampshire, the state that has long held the first nominating primary in the U.S. presidential election cycle.The panel member, Bill Gardner, who is New Hampshire’s secretary of state, had faced calls to resign after commission Vice Chairman Kris Kobach, a Republican, suggested that thousands of people illegally voted in the northeastern state in November.Despite calls by New Hampshire’s four-person, all-Democratic congressional delegation to resign, Gardner said he would not.“New Hampshire people aren’t accustomed to walking away or stepping down from their civic duties,” Gardner said. “I will not either.”He criticized Kobach, who is the Kansas secretary of state, for calling into question the election’s “real and valid” results. Gardner also noted the opposition the commission has faced from its beginning.“The specter of extreme political partisanship already threatens our ability to reach a consensus,” Gardner said.Trump established the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions voted unlawfully in the November presidential election. Most state election officials and election law experts say that U.S. voter fraud is rare.Although Trump handily won the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the outcome of presidential elections, he lost the popular vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes. Trump has said on Twitter that New Hampshire, which he lost to Clinton by fewer than 2,800 votes, and two other states had “serious voter fraud.”Tuesday’s meeting drew protesters as the panel heard from speakers about voting trends and the extent voter fraud exists, something speakers from conservative groups like Judicial Watch and Heritage Foundation said was real.One speaker, John Lott, an economist known for his writings against gun control laws, proposed making voters go through the same federal background check system used for firearm purchases.In a Breitbart News column on Thursday, Kobach claimed voter fraud led to the November victory in New Hampshire for U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat and former governor of the state, over incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,107 votes.Kobach, an advocate of tougher voter identification, also said Clinton may have won New Hampshire due to illegal voting by non-residents. He renewed his views on Tuesday.“This is obviously a subject of concern,” he said.Kobach cited statistics showing 5,313 voters with out-of-state driver’s licenses registered to vote on the day of the election but who did not later obtain New Hampshire licenses.Democrats countered that the data likely reflected college students from out-of-state who were voting.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-vote/new-hampshire-democrat-defends-role-on-trump-voting-commission-idUSKCN1BN130,

REUTERS/Brian Snyder - RTS43ZV The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, created earlier this year by President Donald Trump, convenes for just the second time Tuesday in Manchester, hosted by New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner. The session comes less than a week after commission co-chairman and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach charged in a column on conservative news site Breitbart that voter fraud in the Granite State may account for Democrat Maggie Hassan’s extremely narrow Senate victory last November over incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte. Republican hopeful Kelly Ayotte, former Attorney General of the State of New Hampshire, of Nashua, at a debate at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, N.H., Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2010. (AP) Kobach cited a report, compiled by Gardner and released by New Hampshire Republican state House of Representatives Speaker Shawn Jasper. It showed that more than 5,500 people who registered to vote last November using out of state drivers licenses never subsequently obtained in-state licenses or registered their cars in the state. The state’s laws allow a person to be domiciled in New Hampshire for voting purposes and still be a resident of another state for driver's licensing purposes. One example are students who are in New Hampshire attending colleges or universities. But state law also requires that people who come to live in the state and have a vehicle register it and obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license within 60 days. Ayotte lost to Hassan by just over 1,000 votes out of nearly three-quarters of a million ballots cast. In the same election, President Trump lost New Hampshire’s four electoral votes to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by less than 2,800 votes. Trump trounced Clinton in the all-important Electoral College vote, 306 to 232, to win the presidency. But he lost the national popular count by nearly 3 million votes to Clinton.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - RTX3C3QO Soon after his victory, then-President-elect Trump claimed ""in addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” And he singled out New Hampshire as one of three states with “serious voter fraud.” Many New Hampshire Republicans have long railed against their state’s same-day voter registration law, saying it allows Democrats to game the system. Earlier this year the GOP-dominated state legislature passed a bill tightening voting laws. That measure was signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu, the state’s first Republican governor in a dozen years. Democrats argue the commission is a voter suppression effort led by Trump to justify his voter fraud claims. Top New Hampshire Democrats have urged Gardner, a Democrat who has served more than four decades as secretary of state, to quit the commission. He has no plans to step down. “I don’t have a problem serving on a commission with people who I might disagree with,"" Gardner told Fox News.

(ELIZABETH FRANTZ / Monitor staff)New Hampshire’s Secretary of State plans to hand over a decade’s worth of state voting rolls to President Donald Trump’s Election Integrity Commission.Bill Gardner, a member of the commission, said Friday he is not sure how the information will be used, but that the state will submit the voter records that are public and available for review at the state archives in Concord.“There’s no information (here) someone can’t publicly get anyway,” he said. “People have the right to purchase it, only what’s public by law.”Commission vice chairman Kris Kobach sent a letter Thursday to all 50 states requesting they provide voters’ names, addresses, dates of birth, party affiliation, last four social security number digits and voting histories since 2006. New Hampshire collects that information from cities and towns in a centralized database, though only some of it can be made public under state law. Voters’ personal information, such their drivers license number, naturalization information, place of birth or social security digits are protected and won’t be released, said Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan.The state doesn’t make the centralized database publicly available. Citizens are required to go to individual cities and towns to get public lists of registered voters.However, political parties and candidates routinely buy access to the state voter rolls that Trump’s commission is requesting. The purchase fees are set by statute, though it’s not clear whether Gardner will charge the commission.“I haven’t even thought about that,” he said.Most recently, the New Hampshire Republican State Committee bought voter checklists at the start of June for $8,327, according to state records. Within the last year, voter information was purchased by the New Hampshire Democratic Party, both Maggie Hassan and Kelly Ayotte’s U.S. Senate campaigns and Catalyst for Change, a political action committee linked to a company in Washington D.C., that helps clients “target persuasive messaging” and “mobilize voters,” according to its website.At least two Democratic secretaries of states in California and Kentucky are refusing to furnish the voter data, calling it an invasion of privacy. Kobach’s letter says any documents “submitted to the full Commission will also be made available to the public.” He asked for a response by July 14.Trump formed the commission in May to review alleged voter fraud and tapped Gardner, a Democrat, to join. The appointment sparked concerns from state Democrats, who worried Trump would take advantage of Gardner to promote his own message. But state Republicans have dismissed the worries as “partisan politics.”The commission hasn’t yet met in person. But members held a conference call Wednesday, in which Vice President Mike Pence said he wants the group to find common ground and let the facts speak for themselves, Gardner said. The commission will meet in Washington D.C., on July 19, though Gardner said he has few details about the agenda. His flight will be covered by the commission, not state funds, he said.After Trump lost the presidential contest in New Hampshire, he and his advisers made repeated, unsubstantiated claims of “serious voter fraud” in the state. Gardner has denied “rampant” fraud in New Hampshire and said the state runs fair elections. After Trump made his first claim about fraud in the state in November, Gardner said he believed New Hampshire voters had confidence in the integrity of the state’s elections. This session, Gardner backed a Republican-authored bill seeking to place addition restrictions on same-day voter registration, a move he said would help combat public perception that fraud does exist.",http://www.concordmonitor.com/Trump-election-commission-wants-information-on-every-voter-in-America-11030177,

The 6,540 people who used out-of-state licenses to register on election day may be college students. Or they might not own cars. Perhaps they’re even students who don’t own cars.In any event, as the Washington Post notes, New Hampshire officials have the personal information of all of those people, so “[i]f the Republican legislature and governor would like to dig deeper and determine if any of those 5,000-plus people committed fraud, they certainly can.”Weeks after the election, President Trump alleged that there was “[s]erious voter fraud” in New Hampshire, which he lost to Hillary Clinton by 2,736 votes.But state officials have consistently said there’s no merit to Trump’s claim. Addressing Trump’s tweet in late November, New Hampshire Republican National Committeeman Steve Duprey told the Boston Globe, “I have no idea what he is talking about.”“If they are talking about stuffing ballots here or missing ballots there, well that doesn’t happen in New Hampshire, and there has been no suspicion that it happened this time,” Duprey added.The Times report notes that “[s]ince Election Day, Republicans have charged that a significant number of nonresident Democrats, principally from Massachusetts, flowed into New Hampshire to vote illegally, tilting a close race to their party.” But a Washington Post study found no evidence that New Hampshire voters with Massachusetts licenses determined the outcome.“Of towns where at least 10 voters used out-of-state drivers licenses as identification, the median number of New Hampshire voters with Massachusetts IDs is one,” the Post found. “Two of those were in towns close to the Massachusetts border. As permitted by New Hampshire, people use Massachusetts IDs to register in New Hampshire if they recently moved to the state and have yet to acquire a New Hampshire ID.”While the logical underpinnings of the Washington Times report aren’t sound, that didn’t stop Pence’s co-chair of the Trump administration’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity — Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach — from hyping the piece in his latest Breitbart column.In his column, Kobach falsely claims that the Washington Times story is “proof” that “out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.”“If 59.2 percent or more of them went for [Democratic Sen. Maggie] Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud,” Kobach wrote. “That’s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat (sic) strongholds.”But the Times story doesn’t prove anything. As the Post’s Philip Bump notes, Kobach “is running a federal investigation into the integrity of the voting system — and he cites college kids at Dartmouth as ‘proof’ that Hillary Clinton actually lost the state. His commission, in fact, could ask New Hampshire for the data to investigate these 5,000 cases itself, at which point Kobach could inform the public about whether or not fraud had been proven. Instead he riffed on a Washington Times article.”Meanwhile, on the heels of Kobach’s column, the Post’s Dave Weigel spoke with a number of college students who were among the 6,540 who registered in New Hampshire on election day using out-of-state licenses.“I was a student at Saint Anselm College in Manchester until I graduated this past May, and because I spent most of my time in the state I felt it was right I vote there instead of my native state of New York,” 22-year-old Patrick Derenze told him.Another, 20-year-old Jonah Cohen, said, “I’ve since transferred to Columbia, so I won’t be voting in New Hampshire anymore, but I haven’t changed my registration yet… I did not end up getting a N.H. license, but I never needed one to vote.”When Trump announced the formation of the Pence-Kobach commission in May, the White House proclaimed it would “study vulnerabilities in voting systems.” But it has since become clear that the group is trying to manufacture evidence in support of Trump’s lie that voter fraud cost him the popular vote in order to pave the way for a purge of voter rolls, thereby suppressing voters who are likely to vote for Democrats.",https://thinkprogress.org/pences-spokesman-shares-debunked-report-suggesting-widespread-voter-fraud-cost-trump-new-hampshire-1997364b8a56/,

Among other things, Jasper asked for information on whether those who register to vote in New Hampshire also obtain driver’s licenses or car registrations here.After comparing voter registrations from the November 2016 election to DMV records, the state agencies said about 81 percent of the roughly 6,500 people who registered using out-of-state IDs last year have done neither. New Hampshire law allows people to register to vote using out-of-state IDs, provided they fulfill other state voting requirements or sign an affidavit affirming their eligibility.The number of voters in the data amounts to less than one percent of the overall electorate. But given that Democrats won several top races last year along thin margins — Maggie Hassan defeated Kelly Ayotte in the U.S. Senate race by 1,017 votes, while Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump here by 2,736 votes — Republicans were quick to point to the report as evidence that out-of-state voters illegitimately swayed the election.Within hours of the report’s release, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach penned a Breitbart column pointing to the data as evidence that “a pivotal, close election [the U.S. Senate Race between Kelly Ayotte and Maggie Hassan] was likely changed through voter fraud.” Kobach is co-chair of the Trump administration's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which is meeting in New Hampshire next week and of which New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner is a member.Gardner, in an interview Thursday evening, said he hadn’t yet read Kobach’s column. But, Gardner said, “I’ll certainly talk to him about it next week.”When asked if he had any reason to doubt the legitimacy of last year’s election outcome, Gardner replied: “No.”“That’s why I want to get the facts out there,” Gardner added, referring to his participation on the Trump voting commission. “Not just good facts. I want all the facts.”The report released Thursday doesn’t say where the people who used out-of-state IDs and didn’t follow up with in-state licenses or vehicle registrations voted.Earlier this year, using data provided at the time by the Secretary of State’s office, NHPR found that out-of-state IDs were mostly used in areas surrounding college campuses. New Hampshire law allows out-of-state college students to vote in-state, as long as they meet all other eligibility requirements.",http://nhpr.org/post/data-out-state-ids-fuels-cries-fraud-2016-election,

And for that, they can probably thank Donald Trump.Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire have been eager to pass a voter suppression measure since they seized control of the state legislature in November. That victory was accompanied by close defeats for Trump, who lost the state to Hillary Clinton by less than 3,000 votes, and GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who fell to Democrat Maggie Hassan by a mere 743 votes. Many Republicans attributed those defeats to fraud at the polls. Trump, for his part, asserted that both he and Ayotte would’ve carried the state if “thousands” of people had not been “brought in on buses” from Massachusetts to “illegally” vote in New Hampshire.Trump’s wild conjectures about voter fraud haven’t been limited to the Granite State. He has claimed that 3 to 5 million people cast ballots unlawfully in November and recently established a commission to investigate “improper” and “fraudulent voting.” But New Hampshire’s SB3, which the legislature sent to Republican Gov. Chris Sununu last week, and which Sununu is expected to sign, marks the first concrete consequence of the intense, Trump-stoked voter fraud paranoia that followed the election. The president’s goading provocations have provided cover to New Hampshire Republicans, allowing them to push through a measure that legalizes voter intimidation while disproportionately burdening Democrats.For many years, voting in New Hampshire was relatively easy: The state permitted voters to register all the way through Election Day and required no photo identification. In 2011, however, Republicans passed an ID requirement over the veto of then-Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat. The law allows voters without IDs to sign affidavits to cast ballots, though they must let poll workers take their pictures, a mandate that voting rights advocates liken to mug shots.Even with the voter ID law in place, Democrats continued to win statewide elections in New Hampshire—victories that Republicans often attributed to student voters, who, they believed, took advantage of same-day registration. In 2011, Republicans attempted to end same-day registration and forbid students from voting using school addresses. That year, GOP Speaker of the House William O’Brien told a Tea Party gathering that students’ voting rights must be curbed to prevent more Democrats from winning elections. While those efforts ultimately failed, the idea of killing same-day registration lingered as Republican legislators promoted the myth that Massachusetts residents are bused into the state to cast illegal ballots. (Nobody has ever provided proof that such border-hopping occurs.)The 2016 election brought this conspiracy theory to a fever pitch. Ayotte and Trump’s defeats in the state made the idea of further voting restrictions even more tantalizing; Trump’s focus on New Hampshire as an epicenter of voter fraud made some crackdown inevitable. Although the attorney general and local election officials insisted that these fraud claims were utterly baseless, the legislature forged ahead. In March, Republican state Sen. Regina Birdsell introduced SB3, declaring that college students and “people coming over the border” were swinging elections in the state and that her constituents have seen “cars from Massachusetts coming in on Election Day.”SB3 addressed this ostensible problem by tightening residency and documentation requirements for voters. Under the bill, only individuals who have lived in New Hampshire for longer than 30 days before an election may cast ballots. To prove their residency, voters who register within 30 days of elections must “furnish documentary evidence of domicile,” such as tax forms, leases, or driver’s licenses. If the voter doesn’t have this evidence on hand when she registers, she can sign an affidavit instead. She must then bring the necessary forms to a town hall shortly after an election is held.If the voter fails to follow up, she risks serious legal trouble. An earlier version of the bill allowed police officers to stop by the voter’s address; Birdsell ultimately removed that clause and replaced it with an equally troubling provision that directs Department of Justice investigators to verify domiciles. As the state Senate’s legal counsel pointed out, police officers also retain authority to verify domiciles, meaning the bill licenses both state investigators and law enforcement officers to show up on voters’ doorsteps demanding confirmation of residency. Any voter who cannot provide this evidence may be fined and prosecuted for voter fraud.SB3 is a dramatic reaction to a crisis that simply does not exist. It purports to stop a practice, “drive-by voting,” that was invented to help Republicans suppress Democratic votes. It is rooted in a paranoid fantasy but will have serious real-world repercussions; it seems designed to scare residents, particularly students, out of registering to vote, for fear that they might end up in prison. These consequences are designed to be frightening, to convince likely Democratic voters not to bother. With this bill, New Hampshire has taken the lead in voter intimidation and given Republican officials across the country a new tactic in their fight against the franchise.",http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/06/the_trump_voter_fraud_agenda_has_arrived_in_new_hampshire.html,
There was serious voter fraud in New Hampshire.,http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/trump-claims-serious-voter-fraud-new-hampshire/,False,False,False,False,False,False,Now a court has examined the evidence—and found no such proof.,Kris Kobach Says New Hampshire Is Suffering From Mass Vote Fraud. This Judge Says No.,"On Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump’s “election integrity” commission was preparing to meet in New Hampshire when a state court issued a major ruling: New Hampshire’s harsh new voting restrictions, which would impose fines and jail time on voters who fail to provide certain documentation, cannot be enforced in Tuesday’s special election. According to the court, the law’s penalties likely violate the state constitution, which guarantees all adult residents “an equal right to vote in any election.”The court’s order constituted an oblique rebuke to the commission’s very purpose. New Hampshire’s GOP-controlled legislature passed its voter suppression law in response to Trump’s allegations that mass voter fraud swung the state against him in 2016. Trump formed his voter fraud commission to prove that such fraud gave his opponent millions of illegal votes in the Granite State and beyond. Just last week, commision co-chair Kris Kobach claimed he had “proof” that votes were stolen in the state. Now a court has examined the evidence—and found no such proof. The decision is a well-timed reminder that this administration’s wild claims of voter fraud cannot stand up to even the slightest scrutiny.SB 3, the New Hampshire law at issue, was designed from the start to intimidate voters so severely that some decide it is not worth the trouble to cast a ballot. Its sponsor, Republican Sen. Regina Birdsell, asserted that college students and “people coming over the border” from Massachusetts are swinging state elections—almost exactly what Trump has alleged. Her bill took aim at same-day registration, a long-standing tradition in New Hampshire and a perennial target of Republicans who maintain that it is susceptible to fraud. (In reality, the GOP’s fixation is probably due to the fact that many same-day registrants are college students who lean Democratic.)Although SB 3 did not eliminate same-day voting, it did make registration significantly more onerous—and risky. Under the law, those who register to vote within 30 days of an election, including on Election Day, must provide proof of their New Hampshire “domicile.” If they forgot to bring such proof, they can still register, but they must submit the necessary documentation no more than 10 days after the election. (Residents have 30 days to submit their documents in towns where the clerk’s offices are open part-time.) If voters fail to provide this documentation within the time limit, they are subject to $5,000 fines and up to one year in jail.Voters who have no domicile documentation face different hurdles. These individuals can still register—but to do so, they must consent to have their domicile “verified.” Following the election, the New Hampshire Department of Justice may send state investigators to these voters’ houses and demand confirmation of residency. Police officers also retain authority to show up on voters’ doorsteps demanding proof that they live there. Anyone who fails to provide the necessary evidence may be fined and prosecuted for voter fraud.The New Hampshire Democratic Party and the League of Women Voters challenged these penalties as an infringement upon the state constitution, which protects voting rights. In his Tuesday decision, Superior Court Judge Charles Temple agreed, issuing a restraining order to prevent the state from enforcing SB 3’s punishments. The law, Temple wrote, imposed “severe restrictions on the right to vote.” These restrictions must be “narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance” in order to withstand constitutional scrutiny. They were not, Temple concluded—“by any stretch of the imagination.”The judge continued: “To the Court, these provisions of SB 3 act as a very serious deterrent on the right to vote, and if there is indeed a ‘compelling’ need for them, the Court has yet to see it.” Here, Temple subtly but firmly rejected the state’s contention that SB 3 is necessary to prevent unlawful “drive-by voting,” as New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner put it. Politicians can make whatever wild claims they want—but Temple needed actual evidence of fraud to uphold SB 3’s restrictions. New Hampshire couldn’t provide it.Gardner’s unsubstantiated allegation should not be surprising considering that he sits on Trump’s voter fraud commission alongside Kobach. Last week, Kobach—who has used false allegations of voter fraud to justify disenfranchising thousands—purported to verify claims of New Hampshire fraud in a Breitbart column. He was promptly debunked but still praised SB 3 at Tuesday’s meeting, just hours after the law was blocked in court as unjustified disenfranchisement.This juxtaposition of fact (in Temple’s ruling) and fiction (from Gardner and Kobach) highlights an important problem in the litigation of voting rights. Temple applied strict scrutiny to SB 3 because plaintiffs sued under the New Hampshire Constitution, which explicitly guarantees the right to cast a ballot. Unfortunately, the United States Constitution does not provide this right so clearly. Various constitutional provisions certainly imply a right to vote—but the Supreme Court has interpreted these stingily. Currently, federal courts apply a balancing test to burdens on voting, weighing the purported benefits of a restriction against the burdens. This lenient standard allows states to defend voter suppression laws in federal court by arguing that vague benefits such as “confidence in elections” offset any disenfranchisement.Hucksters like Kobach and the serial fabricators on Trump’s commission triumph when courts do not demand evidence of real fraud before approving voter suppression measures. Temple’s decision provides a model for how other state courts should evaluate such laws; Perry Grossman,  the Voting Rights Project attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union, told me on Tuesday that most state constitutions “have clear and robust language protecting the right to vote.”The United States Supreme Court also should apply stricter scrutiny to any law that restricts access to the ballot, even if state courts are the safer bet. But in recent years, the court has assumed that tough registration requirements, early voting cuts, and voter ID rules are passed with no intent to disenfranchise citizens. Tuesday’s meeting, coupled with Temple’s ruling, demonstrates that, in the Trump era, this judicial presumption of good faith toward Republican-backed restrictions on the right to vote should be obsolete.",http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/kris_kobach_says_new_hampshire_is_suffering_from_mass_vote_fraud_this_judge.html,

Mother Jones reported that the panel will welcome “a controversial pack of witnesses that includes tarnished academics and political allies” of voter-suppression pioneer Kris Kobach, who co-chairs the commission.What’s more, despite the fact that GOP-imposed voting restrictions tend to adversely affect minority communities, 12 of the 12 announced witnesses are white men. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, responded, “By stacking the deck with an all-white and male cast of panelists, the Commission has created an echo chamber to support Kris Kobach’s baseless claims of voter fraud.”But ahead of today’s event, it’s also worth appreciating why Trump’s ridiculous panel chose the Granite State for today’s hearing.The state was one of the first targets of Donald Trump’s claims of illegal voting during the 2016 election — he lost the state by a razor-thin margin (fewer than 2,800 votes). Weeks after he defeated Hillary Clinton, Trump claimed without evidence that the state had “serious voter fraud” and charged that “thousands” of people from Massachusetts were bused into in the Granite State to vote. Trump’s vote fraud panel is coming to New Hampshire on Tuesday for its second public meeting, only days after the commission’s vice chairman amplified in an op-ed the president’s baseless claims that illegal voting had possibly swayed the election in the state.The idea that there was rampant voter fraud in New Hampshire was already discredited in February, when Trump first started pushing this nonsense, but Kansas’ Kris Kobach renewed the push with a piece last week for the right-wing Breitbart website.Not surprisingly, it wasn’t long before the Republican’s argument was thoroughly and completely debunked. Kobach’s case, put simply, was demonstrably absurd.All of which leads to three straightforward questions: (1) is Kobach lying; (2) if so, why; and (3) what should the consequences be for his deliberate attempt to mislead the American people about the right to vote.On the first question, the evidence is unambiguous: it’s impossible to give Kobach’s argument an honest look and take it seriously. The Kansan may be desperate to find “proof” that would help justify new voting restrictions, especially targeting younger voters, but if Kobach wants us to stop laughing at him, he’ll need to look elsewhere.Which leads us to the question of motive. The obvious reason to push a bogus narrative like this one is to create a framework for policymakers: voter-suppression advocates need a rationale to approve new restrictions, and Kobach appears a little too eager to provide them with one.And so what happens now? The Washington Post’s Philip Bump made a powerful case that Kobach’s attempt at public deception is “disqualifying.”This isn’t a game. Trump’s commission seems clearly designed to present fraud as a significant threat to the electoral system, a claim that’s belied by any number of studies, including one looking specifically at New Hampshire, and the lack of nearly any actual uncovered examples of it…. The effect of the commission will invariably be to call for new legislation making it harder to vote. Such a law in Kansas meant that 34,000 fewer people voted in that state in 2012 than in 2008, with those affected skewing younger and less white. Read: More Democratic. Kobach’s past behavior and other recent comments have suggested he’s inappropriate for his Trump-appointed role; this Breitbart essay makes that more clear. Incidentally, it was revealed recently that Kobach is compensated for his work at the conservative site. As a paid columnist, the logical leaps of that piece are questionable, much less as one of the two guys running an ostensibly objective look at if there is fraud in the system. What I’m saying is that the arguments Kobach presents about fraud in New Hampshire – and I recognize the significance of what I’m about to write – should have been too far afield even for Breitbart. They are unquestionably too flawed for someone with the authority that President Trump has bestowed upon him.It’s an underappreciated point: Kobach has been caught lying about voter fraud while helping lead a White House commission on voter fraud. His continued presence on the panel is an embarrassment.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-voting-commission-heads-nh-amid-ongoing-controversies,

He also alleged that voter fraud occurred in other states.In February, he told former Sen. Kelly Ayotte during a meeting at the White House that both of them lost New Hampshire in November because thousands of people were “brought in on buses” from Massachusetts to “illegally” vote in New Hampshire.Earlier, about three weeks after the election, Trump alleged in a tweet, “Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.”At the time, Gardner and then-Attorney General Joseph Foster said they were aware of a small number of voter fraud cases under review, but not widespread voter fraud.Still, Gardner said in May, shortly after being named to the commission, that he accepted the appointment because he is concerned that nationally, voter confidence in elections is low.Word of the commission’s plan to meet in the Granite State comes after a controversy nationally over panel vice chairman Kris Kobach’s request that states provide information about their voters to the commission for research purposes.Gardner is preparing to send publicly available information on New Hampshire’s registered voters to Washington to comply with the request issued by Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state.Gardner's transfer of the information will come in the wake of an Aug. 8 resolution of a lawsuit filed by two state lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire seeking to block the transfer of the data.The lawmakers and the ACLU withdrew the suit after the state Attorney General’s Office, representing Gardner, reaffirmed in a court filing that Gardner intents to provide only information that is already publicly available – voters’ names, domicile addresses and party affiliations, if any.The information will be provided in the form of scanned paper copies of marked checklists routinely collected from cities and towns after elections.The Superior Court judge who was set to hear the case, Charles S. Temple, issued an order noting that the parties “have agreed to a resolution in this case” and ruled that the parties must file “a pleading confirming this resolution” by Sept. 8.Wednesday, the New Hampshire Democratic Party and League of Women Voters filed separate lawsuits seeking to block from taking effect a controversial new law tightening the state's voter registration process, Senate Bill 3. The bill was passed by Republicans in the State Legislature and had the support of Gardner, a Democrat.The Democratic Party alleges the law is unconstitutional.“SB 3 imposes several brand new, highly confusing, unnecessary and intimidating hurdles to voting,” the NHDP writes in its lawsuit. “It will not only burden and, in some cases, disenfranchise eligible, lawful New Hampshire citizens, but will expose countless innocent voters to criminal and civil liability.”In a statement, NHDP Chairman Raymond Buckley said: Trump's election integrity commission is about as welcome in New Hampshire as his offensive comments about the state.Granite Staters are still seething from Gov.

I will not either.He criticized Kobach, who is the Kansas secretary of state, for calling into question the election's real and valid results. Gardner also noted the opposition the commission has faced from its beginning.The specter of extreme political partisanship already threatens our ability to reach a consensus, Gardner said.Trump established the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions voted unlawfully in the November presidential election. Most state election officials and election law experts say that U.S. voter fraud is rare.Although Trump handily won the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the outcome of presidential elections, he lost the popular vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes. Trump has said on Twitter that New Hampshire, which he lost to Clinton by fewer than 2,800 votes, and two other states had serious voter fraud.Tuesday's meeting drew protesters as the panel heard from speakers about voting trends and the extent voter fraud exists, something speakers from conservative groups like Judicial Watch and Heritage Foundation said was real.One speaker, John Lott, an economist known for his writings against gun control laws, proposed making voters go through the same federal background check system used for firearm purchases.In a Breitbart News column on Thursday, Kobach claimed voter fraud led to the November victory in New Hampshire for U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat and former governor of the state, over incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,107 votes.Kobach, an advocate of tougher voter identification, also said Clinton may have won New Hampshire due to illegal voting by non-residents. He renewed his views on Tuesday.This is obviously a subject of concern, he said.Kobach cited statistics showing 5,313 voters with out-of-state driver's licenses registered to vote on the day of the election but who did not later obtain New Hampshire licenses.Democrats countered that the data likely reflected college students from out-of-state who were voting.",http://wifc.com/news/articles/2017/sep/12/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-to-meet-in-new-hampshire/,

On Sunday, Nov. 27, President-elect Donald Trump said on Twitter serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. On Monday the New Hampshire Attorney General's office said it doesn't have evidence to back up that claim (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)A Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission isn’t going to let President Donald Trump go without providing evidence that there was voter fraud during the 2016 presidential election in New Hampshire.In yet another letter to Trump, FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub is asking Trump to provide proof of his claim that thousands of Democratic Massachusetts residents were bused to the Granite State on election day to illegally vote against him.“This allegation of a vast conspiracy, involving thousands of people committing felony criminal acts aimed at stealing the election, has deeply disturbed citizens throughout America,” she wrote in a Wednesday letter. “I have heard from many of them, including proud and patriotic New Englanders who are shocked by the allegation and feel that it impugns their historic role in our democracy.”She also called on Trump in February to provide evidence for his voter fraud claim.This latest letter adds fuel to the fire of what’s already been a heated debate between Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire when it comes to the state’s election laws. In fact, the Senate is close to voting on a major bill that would close several of the state’s voting law loopholes, according to Republicans.The legend of Massachusetts voters busing into the Granite State to cast a ballot in our elections is not a new tale, but here’s a quick timeline of events that led to this sweeping legislation:Yet, it didn’t stop there. Trump kept talking about voter fraud even after his presidential inauguration.Many Republicans and Democrats are upset that Trump is pushing a false narrative and is making people question the integrity of the democratic voting process. However, his statement perfectly illustrates what his supporters and several Republicans believe is the problem with election laws in New Hampshire: The current laws make it difficult to charge anyone with voter fraud because what’s legal here is usually illegal in another state.Hence, Senate Bill 3, which was introduced by Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, to address a lot of those concerns. Of course, the bill is divided on party lines — it’s cheered by Republicans who say they are trying to tighten the process and ensure that those who vote in New Hampshire actually live in New Hampshire and criticized by Democrats who say the bill is a form of voter suppression.One of the issues it focuses on is the definition of domicile, which varies from state to state, and the New Hampshire Legislature is trying to better define the difference between “domicile” and “residence” in this bill. Under current laws, the definition of domicile is “that place, to which upon temporary absence, a person has the intention of returning.” Republicans think that’s vague and allows campaign workers, who might be in the state for a month or so, to vote in New Hampshire, even if they plan on leaving after the election.An incident occurred in the 2008 and 2012 elections when Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, allowed Democratic staffers to live at her home. The staffers used her address to vote in the election, and since they were living in the state for at least three months before the election, the Attorney General ruled that it was legal.Under the new bill, a person who registers to vote within 30 days of an election or on Election Day must show verification that a New Hampshire address is his or her domicile. That can be done by showing proof of residency at a college or university, driver’s license, utility bill, among other forms. Those who do not show documentation can still register and vote by filling out a domicile affidavit and registration form, and provide the documentation within 10 or 30 days of Election Day, depending on the community. Someone could get charged with voter fraud if they fail to provide a document verifying his or her domicile within that window.A previous version of the bill called for police officer to knock on doors to verify a voter’s domicile, but that provision was taken out this week. The bill still allows municipal officials to visit those addresses or ask “agents” to do so.The Senate Election Law Committee recommended Tuesday in favor of the bill by a 3-2 vote on party lines and it now heads to the full Senate for a vote.Adding to the controversy, the Attorney General’s office recently said investigations into thousands of affidavit voters who cast ballots in New Hampshire without identification during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles have been dropped due to the lack of manpower and money to complete the investigations.How can the Attorney General and Secretary of State’s office say there is no evidence of voter fraud if they aren’t investigating every potential violation? That’s what Republicans are asking.Sununu’s budget didn’t fulfill the attorney general’s request for roughly $93,000 annually to hire a full-time elections investigator. A Senate bill would provide about $500,000 to the Attorney General’s office for with focus on elections, lobbying, and campaign finance law. That bill passed the Senate and is now in the House Finance Committee.“No matter how you change it, there is not a problem in the state of New Hampshire,” said Senate Democratic Leader Jeff Woodburn. “There’s been a ruse of illegal voting, and Trump buses, and all of this business. This is nothing but a concerted national attempt to suppress voting and harass voters.”“This is not national trend legislation,” Birdsell said this week. “This is homegrown here. It is something that is trying to address what some of our constituents are looking for.”The debate on this bill, and the discussion of voter fraud in New Hampshire, is far from over.",http://www.insidesources.com/voter-fraud-new-hampshire/,

The deal, some observers claimed, marked Trump’s long-awaited pivot to conventional Presidential leadership and a bipartisan style of governing. Some praised this maneuver as statesmanlike, while others denounced it as a betrayal of the President’s fellow-Republicans, but there was something close to consensus that Trump had jettisoned the hard-right politics expressed at the beginning of his term in office and begun a new and different chapter.This is, to put it charitably, nonsense. Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, the top Democrats in Congress, understandably accepted a modest political gift from the President; Trump, by agreeing to just a three-month extension of the deadlines, gave the opposition party somewhat more leverage when the next negotiation takes place, before the end of the year. But, notwithstanding the developments of last week, which mostly amount to inside baseball, the course of the Trump Presidency is set, and conservatives are still very much in charge.A vivid example of the right-wing hegemony in the Trump Administration will be on display today, when the Presidential Advisory Commission on Voter Integrity convenes for the second time. It is difficult to imagine a more cynical enterprise than this commission, which Trump appointed after he claimed (falsely) that the casting of illegal votes last November accounted for his loss of the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by a margin of nearly three million. Trump named Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, who has been the nation’s leading advocate for restrictions on voting rights, as the vice-chair of the commission. (Vice-President Mike Pence is the chair.) Kobach will preside at today’s meeting, which will convene in Manchester, New Hampshire. (To further confuse matters, the meeting will be hosted by New Hampshire’s longtime secretary of state, Bill Gardner, a Democrat who also sits on the commission but who has, in the past, been skeptical of voter-fraud charges.) The choice of this location is characteristic of the incompetence and malevolence that is at the heart of the vote-suppression agenda.Hillary Clinton and Senator Maggie Hassan—who defeated the Republican incumbent, Kelly Ayotte—both won narrow victories in New Hampshire, in 2016. Kobach has claimed that those results are suspect because out-of-state voters may have cast ballots for the Democrats. Last Wednesday, the speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Shawn Jasper, a Republican, released data showing that six thousand five hundred and forty people had registered to vote using out-of-state driver’s licenses. Using such licenses for voter registration is legal in the state, but it was pointed out that only a thousand and fourteen of these people later obtained a New Hampshire license. This, Kobach suggested in a column that he wrote last week for Breitbart, means that most of those voters never lived in New Hampshire at all.This is absurd. As the Brennan Center for Justice , at the New York University School of Law, and New Hampshire Public Radio , among others, have noted, most of these out-of-state licenses likely belonged to college students, who are allowed to vote in New Hampshire under state law and would have had no reason to obtain a New Hampshire license after Election Day. Such misleading allegations typify the voter-fraud campaign, because it’s really a cure for which there is no disease. In-person voter fraud—cases of people intentionally voting in elections in which they are not entitled to participate—is a minuscule, if not nonexistent, problem in the United States. The real agenda is to make it harder for Democrats to vote, and thus, to make it easier to Republicans to win elections.The results of Trump’s voting commission are preordained. It will inevitably seek to impose measures that will have the effect of erecting barriers to voting for poor people, who generally vote Democratic. The commission will call for requiring more forms of identification to register, and the possession of photo identification to actually cast ballots. In addition, the commission will almost certainly pursue limitations on early voting and absentee balloting, all as part of a supposed effort to combat fraud. During the Obama Administration, the Justice Department, under Eric Holder and then Loretta Lynch, got courts to limit some of the worst voter-suppression efforts, especially those in Texas and North Carolina. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has withdrawn from this undertaking, and, just as he did when he was a senator, he has embraced the vote-suppression agenda. We may never definitively know how Republican efforts to discourage Democratic votes affected the outcome of the 2016 election. (The Republican changes to the law in Wisconsin may well have skewed the results there in Trump’s favor.) But we do know that, in state after state, Republican legislators made it harder for Democrats to vote.If the President had the slightest inclination toward bipartisanship, as some appear to think he displayed last week, he would disband the fraud commission. It exists solely to help the Republican Party, with no residual benefits for anyone else in the country. Trump, of course, will not disband it, and his failure to do so will be the clearest evidence (if any is needed) that there was no pivot last week, but at most a very slight detour on the road to an electoral future of Republican dominance.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-heads-to-new-hampshire,

Astonishing extent of Kim's propaganda machine REVEALED,"The bizarre paintings show the rogue state to be the greatest sporting nation in the world - winning everything from draughts to boxing.  The baffling pictures, which were mostly produced in the 2000s, capture the hermit kingdom’s alleged sporting achievements over the years. And the images have resurfaced today as international tensions between North Korea and the west continue to intensify following a series of terrifying threats. In the images, the North Korea football team can be seen crying tears of joy as they win the FIFA World Cup.While a third shows the fictitious moment athlete Jong Song-ok defeated her western opponents at the 2000 Olympic Games to win gold. The 43-year-old athlete did in fact win gold for North Korea at the 1999 World Athletics Championships in Seville. But it was reported Kim Jong-il personally banned her from competing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney for fear of national embarrassment if she lost the next race.The bizarre collection also features a painting of a North Korean boxer entitled 'For The Dignity of The Country’, along with a track athlete holding up the North Korea flag as he races along the track. But it is not the first time the North Korean regime has faked sporting triumphs to instil nationalistic pride into their people.  In 2014, a video appeared online showing North Korea's state-controlled media telling their football fans that the national team have reached the World Cup final in Brazil.  Kim Jong-un is a notorious fan of Manchester United football team and last month allegedly voiced his hope that North Korea players could join the Premier League.However, the secretive state’s achievements are huge exaggerations - especially evident within football. The North Korean national football team have only appeared in the World Cup twice in their history.  They famously reached the quarter-finals at their World Cup debut in 1966, beating Italy in the group stage.  Then in 2009, the team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup but were defeated 0-7 in their game against Portugal.There were reports that the North Korean government punished the coach and players of the team by sending them on a hard labour in mines.  However, FIFA's investigators could not confirm this. North Korea propaganda is not just boosting the country's sporting achievements, however. Chilling propaganda art also shows US soldiers torturing women, setting dogs on cowering families and leaving helpless babies to die.",http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/873553/North-Korea-news-propaganda-World-Cup-winner-sport-boxing-athletics-Kim-Jong-un,

Its mock video of a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match has garnered over 8 million views.The video’s charm? It appears to tell North Koreans that their team made it to the final and will face the powerhouse team from Portugal.We at PunditFact took an interest because bloggers, and maybe even some journalists, thought North Korea was actually trying to put one over on its citizens. We want to be clear: The video is a fake.But a writer for the blog posted, North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final.The bulk of the post is a copy and paste from an article on the British website, :We’ve known for a long time now that supreme leader Kim Jong-un controls the flow of information to his people, with the television channels only reporting positive stuff about the country.But in a report posted on YouTube, the media have been caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup.The report says North Korea’s brave side crushed Japan 7-0, USA 4-0 and China 2-0 in the group stages, before going on to reach the final… against Portugal.Of course, the real final, which takes place this Sunday, is between Germany and Argentina.The Outside the Beltway blogger observes at the end, This is yet another example of just how pervasive the Kim dictatorship is, and just how hard it will likely be to integrate this nation into the real world when that regime finally falls.We emailed the blogger and didn’t hear back. Curiously, by the time other readers saw the Metro article he linked to, it said something quite different from the words he quoted. The second sentence was key.But in a brilliant spoof report posted on YouTube, the media appears to be caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup, the Metro article said.We emailed the Metro sports writer to see if the article had been changed from the original but again, no word back. So it’s possible that that sports writer had also been pulled in, but we can’t say.From the comments on the Outside the Beltway blog, it is clear that while most readers doubted the newscast’s authenticity, others were ready to believe that the North Korean propaganda machine was aiming for a personal best in the disinformation category.There are several reasons the North Korean government would be unlikely to try such a stunt. For one, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the games, although not live. Also, most North Koreans would likely know that about two years ago, their team failed to qualify for the World Cup. It ranks 137 in the FIFA world rankings; only 32 countries get to compete.Soccer stat maven and professor of government at Cornell University Chris Anderson said making it to the final is basically impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds.Stephen Epstein, a specialist in Korean culture and society at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, noted several elements in the video would instantly tell a trained viewer that it was a joke.As soon as I saw it, I knew what it was, Epstein said. The way the women was speaking, her accent, sounded like a South Korean broadcaster.  Also she used the word ‘fighting’ (an English word brought over to South Korea). It clearly was not from the north.In fact, Epstein said he thinks only people outside South Korea were suckered. But he said that’s understandable.If you don’t have a real familiarity with North Korea and just know what Western media generally provides, this would fit with a preconceived stereotype, Epstein said.It’s not as though North Korea doesn’t exercise creative license. According to the official biography of its previous leader Kim Jong Il, he was born on  Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. In reality, historians place his birth on Russian soil near Vladivostok where his father lived in a camp for Korean exiles.There’s also another sports myth, and this one is interesting because it has morphed over time.In 1994, the Agence France Presse news service said the golf pro at the Pyongyang golf course told a reporter with the Australian Financial Review that Kim Jong Il had scored 5 holes-in-one on his very first time on the links.He is an excellent golfer, the pro told the reporter.What’s notable about this factoid is that it was first ascribed to the golf pro alone, with no witnesses, as told to a named Australian reporter. By 2003, the New York Post had it at 11 holes-in-one. In 2011, the golf website had the 11, plus that the feat was witnessed by 17 security guards and dutifully reported to the North Korean masses by the state news agency.With golf as with soccer, stories about North Korea seem to have the ability to take on a life of their own.Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country. Plus, North Korea had been broadcasting the World Cup and any soccer fan there would know that their team failed to qualify.We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/17/blog-posting/blog-says-north-korea-told-its-people-their-team-m/,

Cringing from the still raw memory of their own team's hiding at the hands of Brazil, the Sydney Morning Herald today ran a story on the All Whites' 1-1 draw with Slovakia under the headline 'Australasia 1-1 Slovakia', wrote a slightly confused Herald hack. That's right - apparently New Zealand has ceased to exist and is now part of a country called 'Australasia'. And apparently Germany has ceased to exist and is now part of a country called Brazil.In Wellington and North Island's Dominion Post scribbler Marc Hinton reports that All Whites fever has broken out in the All Blacks with New Zealand rugby's finest well and truly caught up in the exploits of their cross-code cousins in South Africa. The Haka-performing muscle-men took time out from plotting Saturday's humiliation of Wales at Carisbrook to watch Winston Reid, Ryan Nelsen and chums pull off their historic last-gasp moral victory.I think probably the whole team watched it, revealed All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith. I dozed off at the wrong time, but struggled to stay awake and missed the goal, but I'll catch it on the replay. Asked if he was concerned that the burgeoning popularity of the All Whites might overshadow the efforts of his rugby players, Smith was unconcerned. I don't even think about it, I don't care about that. All I care about is the team, the performance and us being proud of ourselves, said the man who owes football a huge debt of gratitude, considering he wouldn't even be in a job if William Webb Ellis hadn't decided to cheat that time back in 1876.Considerably closer to home, under the headline England: you're running scared! the Sun reports that Clint Dempsey has been banging his gavel and delivering a damning verdict on Fabio Capello's men. In a series of quotes from which the words 'running' and 'scared' are conspicuously absent, the USA man doesn't so much deliver a damning verdict as casually observe the blindingly obvious: Honestly, it seemed during the game that they were dealing with a lot of pressure, he said. They were edgy, there was an edginess to their game but I think they're a team with quality and they should play with confidence.A forlorn looking Robbie Earle features prominently in most of today's papers after being dismissed from his cushy £175,000-per-year gig as a pundit with ITV1 because 37 tickets he'd bought through ITV1 for family and friends for the Holland v Denmark match fell into the hands of models employed as orange-clad footsoldiers for some beer company's ambush marketing campaign. Earle has since denied any wrongdoing, although the Sun suggests he's passed on up to 150 tickets since the start of the tournament. Not a staggering amount, admittedly, although he'd look very stupid indeed if they were questions on Mastermind.Robbie is a smashing bloke but our inquiries quickly established there were other games in which he had passed on tickets, said an unnamed ITV source. We cannot say whether any of this was for financial gain. But Robbie was dismissed with immediate effect. The mysterious affair leaves several questions unanswered: 1) How popular a bloke must you be to be able to buy 150 tickets for mates who just happen to be in the Soweto area without arousing suspicion and 2) why couldn't it have been Alan Shearer?Away from the World Cup Rafa Benítez used his official unveiling as the new Inter manager to speak out about his sadness at having to leave Liverpool. It was not easy - the fans, the Kop have been fantastic, he said, shortly before sticking the knife in. I needed to move, Inter is a massive club, he said, the tacit suggestion being, of course, that Liverpool is not. Benítez had advice for his former American bosses on who they should appoint as his replacement, suggesting Kenny Dalglish. He is the man for the job, said Rafa, who is no doubt aware that Tom Hicks and George Gillett think Dalglish is anything but and was mischievously stirring the pot accordingly. The owners should listen to the fans because they are unhappy. Unhappy enough to organise another of those really effective 200-yard protest ambles from a pub they were going to be in anyway to a match they were going to anyway? Only time will tell.If Liverpool fans are unhappy now, they'll be even more unhappy when they read the Daily Star's account that Real Madrid are ready to buy Steven Gerrard. The news that they're also after Wayne Rooney and will pay £110m for the pair might cheer them up a bit, as will the fact that the Star's exclusive isn't backed up by anything stronger than a wishy-washy quote from an anonymous Real source that could be the bored looking, gum-chewing kid working in the club shop for his summer holidays.The lure of London, could prove too strong for Juan Román Riquelme to resist, according to his Mr 15% Barry McIntosh, who says the Argentina playmaker may turn down approaches from four other Premier League clubs in order to live near the Natural History Museum, Buckingham Palace and that while playing for West Ham.And finally, the lure of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan's money could prove too strong for Barcelona players Yaya Touré and Dani Alves to resist, although there's every possibility we're being excessively cynical again and they've genuinely always wanted to live within easy access to the collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings housed in Mosley Street's Manchester Art Gallery.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/16/world-cup-2010-paper-view-barry-glendenning,

It claimed to show the North Korean government had duped its population into believing it had won soccer’s 2014 FIFA World Cup, despite the team having failed to qualify for the tournament and having lost all three games on its most recent appearance in 2010.It was all quite amusing and could best be described as fake news about fake news, about a country often accused of fake news. Twenty-first century problems, indeed.Ludicrous as it was, it was also potentially plausible, given that the North Korean regime’s relationship with the truth is far from monogamous, and sports has routinely crossed over into its web of fantasy.Levity aside, if you’re a North Korean athlete, you’d better be a darn good one. North Korea competes at many international sporting events, including the Rio Olympics last year. Once they’re there, they’re not allowed to say much, and we don’t hear much about them again.At Rio, female gymnast Hong Un-jong warmed hearts and prompted a Twitter storm by posing for a selfie with a  competitor from South Korea. Heartbreakingly, female weightlifter Kim Kuk-Hyang cut a distraught figure on the podium after claiming silver, having been one of the athletes expected to win gold by controversial leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il’s son and successor. Kim Jong-un predicted a haul of 12 medals and at least five golds from Rio. The team returned home with seven medals, two of which were gold.Kim Hyeong-soo, a former employee of the wonderfully yet cryptically named Longevity Institute, told reporters after defecting two years ago that underperforming athletes face punishment.“If they had a gold medal of course they would receive a huge benefit like a car, a new apartment in Pyongyang and extra rice,” he said. “But if they have a bad result the athletes and the coach can actually be sent for hard labor for several months.”A United Nations special commission report in 2014 said that political prison camps are still widely used in North Korea.North and South Korea are still politically, physically (by a wall and demilitarized zone) and ideologically separated, yet the women’s hockey teams of both countries met in a world championship qualifying game this month. South Korea won 3-0 after its rivals from the North lowered their heads for the opposing anthem. The players posed for a joint photograph, but otherwise did not appear to interact.The nations rarely meet in sports, due largely to the political complications. The 2010 soccer World Cup draw was arranged so that the two teams could not play each other before the semifinals.Needless to say, that didn’t transpire, with North Korea performing admirably in a 2-1 defeat to Brazil before falling apart, losing 7-0 to Portugal and 3-0 to  Ivory Coast.The team was cheered on by a group of mysterious fans during play in South Africa. It turned out this fans volunteer army was mostly made up of Chinese, having bought tickets through a Chinese sports PR agency in conjunction with the North Korean sports ministry.The three defeats came despite apparent tactical interventions from Kim Jong-il himself, with Kim Jong-hun, the coach who was later allegedly banished to a labor camp, saying that the Great Leader, Father of the People and Sun of the Communist Future had been communicating with him via “invisible telephone,” a contraption that has so far proved beyond the geniuses at Apple.According to South Korean news media outlets, the players were subjected to lengthy and humiliating interrogations from government officials when they returned home, sparking concern from FIFA, soccer's world governing body.Things also went south for the 2011 Women’s World Cup team, which lost 2-0 to the United States in the opening game and failed to win any of its three matches. The delightful official explanation for the struggles was that several players had been struck by lightning, requiring them to be treated with traditional deer musk medicine, which unwittingly caused five of them to test positive for steroids.If Kong Jong-un has unrealistically lofty expectations for his nation’s athletes, it is easy to see why he has set the bar so high. After all, he apparently grew up surrounded by sporting excellence, personified in the form of his dad, Kim Jong-il.Some remember the elder Kim as an obsessive despot that played a game of nuclear chicken with the West, deepened his nation’s isolation and swaggered around luxury palaces while many of his citizens starved.Yet, according to the treasure trove of factual nuggets that is the North Korean state media, the current leader’s father was also a sensational athlete. What a moment it must have been in 1994 when Kim Jong-il graced Pyongyang’s 7,700-yard championship course and belted a wondrous round of 38 for 18 holes – a mere 31-under par that included five spectacular holes in one.Soon after he turned his hand to bowling and was just as proficient, firing off a perfect game of 300 on his first trip to the lanes.Maybe it really did happen and it surely would have been great to be there to see it. Maybe it was a fake story, like so many others seem to be. It was widely speculated last week that a military parade in Pyongyang purporting to show a powerful arsenal of nuclear weapons was not as mighty it claimed to be either.But when it comes to war games, not just games, you really want to be sure.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2017/04/24/north-korea-world-cup-soccer-golf-kim-jong-il/100854028/,
North Korea is telling its people that their mens national team is in the World Cup final.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/17/blog-posting/blog-says-north-korea-told-its-people-their-team-m/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Why Russia Won't Help More on North Korea,"The communiques out of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations were exultant on Monday. They lauded the unanimous passage in the Security Council of the “strongest sanctions ever imposed” on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. Among other prohibitions, North Korea has now been prevented from exporting textiles—one of its few industries. It will also have a harder time importing oil and fuel, won’t be able to send its workers abroad to earn cash as easily, and will be forced to shutter any joint ventures. But as The Washington Post’s Joby Warrick reported, the sanctions were heavily watered down thanks to objections from China and Russia. Rightfully, there has been much condemnation of the China-based companies that do business with North Korea and Chinese-North Korean entities that continue to operate. These entities make up the largest source of hard cash and material reinforcements for Kim Jong Un’s hermit kingdom, but Russia’s support of North Korea is also quite significant, and has grown alongside international condemnation of that regime’s belligerence.Moscow’s assistance to Pyongyang has emerged not out of a desire to promote its nuclear program, but because Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, sees Kim very much like he see his own country: victims of a U.S.-led international system that tramples on their choices and sovereignty. Russia is itself under international sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its military actions in Ukraine. For Russia, sanctions that successfully force North Korea either to alter its military choices or lead to a change in its leadership would set a dangerous precedent—the possibility of regime change anywhere is never to be encouraged. Pyongyang’s economic engagement with Moscow ranges from small enterprises to large schemes that help Russia more cheaply fulfill its goals. The U.S. State Department approximates that around 20,000 North Koreans are sent—most, forcibly—to work in Russia each year for Russian companies (some estimates say the number is as high as 50,000). North Korea’s largest money makers in Russia are in the fields of logging and construction. These workers live in “slave-like conditions,” are poorly fed and equipped, and only receive a small fraction of the salaries that they are due. The rest, allegedly, goes straight to Kim’s coffers. According to James Hoare’s Historical Dictionary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Russia has hosted North Korean labor camps since 1967, when the then-Soviet Union was shrinking its notorious gulag system. Many gulag camps had forced their prisoners to do hard, manual work; the arrival of North Koreans helped replace some of that cheap labor. These North Korean camps, which exist to this day, do the same kind of logging work in Siberia’s harsh, endless forests that their gulag predecessors once did. It's Not Just America Losing Patience With North Korea North Korean construction workers toil in similarly miserable situations. They were spotted by Norwegian journalists working to finish the newly opened Zenit Arena in St. Petersburg that will be used during the 2018 World Cup. One worker told The Guardian that the men were earning money to help “facilitate the country’s defense.” German journalists have also found North Koreans working to repair and complete World Cup 2018 stadiums in Moscow and Ekaterinburg. Qatar, which will host the 2022 World Cup, has taken its lead from Russia and currently has 2,800 North Koreans working in part to build the infrastructure needed for the event.In addition, there are a variety of small North Korean-owned businesses across Russia. These range from North Korean-owned, -operated, and -staffed restaurants in Russia’s far east, to small tourism operations. North Korea recently opened a travel agency in Russia to bring Russian tourists to North Korea, while a passenger and cargo ferry service between Vladivostok, Russia, and Rason, North Korea, was opened in May 2017. Russian businesses in Vladivostok often hire North Koreans to paint and decorate homes in their city. While these workers may be the main conduit of Russian money into North Korea, Russia has aided the country in other ways. In 2014, it forgave 90 percent of the nearly $11 billion in debt that it (and the Soviet Union before it) was owed by North Korea. The remaining portion of the debt was to be repaid to Russia by deposits into an account that could then be used to grow Russian-North Korean ties and trade. To avoid the difficulties that western sanctions have placed on payments and financial transfers to North Korea, the two countries have an arrangement by which Russia pays Pyongyang in rubles. In its latest tranche of sanctions on North Korea, the U.S. Treasury Department included some Russian individuals and Russian-linked companies that assist Pyongyang in laundering money and obtaining fuel, exposing the means through which Russia—like China—helps keep the lights on in North Korea.Altogether, the total volume of trade between North Korea and Russia is quite small, though likely underreported. In 2016, the trade volume between the two countries was only $76.9 million, down from a high of $234.9 million in 2005. So why, then, is Moscow loath to crack down on Pyongyang? The answer may lie in the use of the West's favorite instrument of international punishment: sanctions. While Putin has said that North Korea’s nuclear program “is creating threats to security in North-east Asia,” he has also condemned the idea that it is possible to solve the North Korea issue with “sanctions and pressure alone” and warned against “driving North Korea in a corner.” For a Russia that remains under relatively heavy U.S. and European Union sanctions for its annexation of Crimea in 2014, its continued invasion of eastern Ukraine, and the shoot-down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014, helping North Korea stand firm against Western pressure is rather a matter of principle. Resisting U.S. calls for strict sanctions on Pyongyang is yet another way for Putin to demonstrate to both his public and the international community that he will not give in to western pressure to change his behavior in Ukraine. Through Russian eyes, then, North Korea's resolve in the face of American and international pressure is admirable and worth supporting. So while Russia may seem to go along with UN sanctions on North Korea, it works behind the scenes to make them as toothless as possible. Monday's sanctions package, for example, originally would have banned the use of North Korean labor, but was weakened after Russian protests. Those concessions they do make on sanctioning North Korea are carefully calculated to give up as little as possible, continue aiding North Korea as much as possible, and maintaining the façade that Russia is a useful international partner. When asked recently about the effect that sanctions were having on North Korea, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that “the imposed sanctions have not created any positive outcome.” Yet part of their failure can be chalked up to Russia’s refusal to truly adhere to these sanctions, and the Russian government’s continued insistence on maintaining its economic relationship with North Korea. There is unfortunately little to be done about Russia’s determination to undermine sanctions on North Korea. After three years under similar sanctions Russia has become adept at evading the worst strictures and is happy to help North Korea do the same. A North Korea that shrivels under harsh sanctions is not an acceptable option for Moscow. To allow such a scenario would be to admit its own vulnerability to similar measures. The Kremlin is certainly not thrilled about North Korea's nuclear ambitions, but for now it is more important for birds of an anti-Western feather to flock together. Meanwhile, nations committed to halting North Korea’s belligerence will have to work harder and more creatively to both calm the North Korean situation and buttress the international order.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/russia-north-korea-putin-kim-nuclear-united-nations-sanctions/539592/,

But the circumstances of the citizens living in North Korea are not so funny, and the historical precedent is there to indicate that the treatment that the players are subjected to may not be so funny either.There’s no denying that the squad rightfully earned its spot in the World Cup field. They qualified in the hotly contested Asian region and performed admirably representing their country.But the question arises if they are truly “representing their country.”One of the most distinctive aspects of the World Cup is the influx of fans that travel from around the world to support their homeland. The colorful cultures, as well as costumes, define the atmosphere of the World Cup.The North Korean fans that appeared at their first match against Brazil were certainly distinctive, but in an eerie sort of way.During the match, a block of seats in the stadium were occupied by emotionless men and women who were dressed in identical red clothing, and could be seen holding small North Korean flags. There was speculation that these fans were not Korean at all, and were in fact paid actors from China.The LA Times later spoke to one of the participants in the group named Kim Yong Chon, who stated that the fans were in fact North Korean, and had been carefully recruited by the government to make the trip.The LA Times further reported that these fans “spoke only infrequently to one another — Chon said they didn't know one another before coming to South Africa — and mainly reacted to the action on the field only when directed to do so by a man who stood before them like an orchestra conductor.”Countrymen that are carefully recruited by the government and are only permitted to show emotion at the order of a conductor hardly seems in line with the spirit of the World Cup. In fact, they appear to be little more than an extension of a radical dictators propaganda machine.And oddly enough, these North Koreans that were forced to temper their emotions are among the luckiest citizens in the country — at least they’re going to be allowed to watch their home side play in the World Cup.North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il ordered the state-run television networks in his country to not broadcast North Korea’s World Cup matches live, and to only show highlights of victories. The only way citizens of the country will be able to watch the World Cup is if North Korea wins the tournament.Essentially there is basically no chance that the citizens of North Korea will be granted the opportunity to watch the team that is supposedly representing them compete on the world stage.But perhaps what’s most troubling about North Korea’s participation in the World Cup is that there is no telling how the Supreme Leader will deal with the team if they are unsuccessful.There is no free press in North Korea that can monitor the actions of its government, and this can have dire consequences.Consider another dictatorship whose athletes were unsuccessful in international competition: Iraq.Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein’s son, served as the President of the National Olympic Committee, and following his demise, stories emerged about his common practice of torturing and murdering Iraqi athletes who failed to win.This isn’t to say that North Korea engages in similar practices, but because there is absolutely no way to monitor the actions of the government, if such atrocities were to be taking place, FIFA would have no way of knowing.A scare already occurred during North Korea’s first match when four North Korean players were missing from the roster and the stadium.There was wide-speculation about the whereabouts of the players until they turned up the next day at practice.Rather than reprimanding North Korea for this bizarre occurrence, FIFA has taken a page out of the North Korean playbook and restricted the questions that North Korean players can be asked by reporters. This practice is counter to FIFA’s open media policy with the other 31 countries involved in the World Cup.We are here to talk about football not politics.” said a FIFA spokesman in defense.There will hopefully be a time in the not too distant future when North Korea — the actual North Korea — can compete in the World Cup. But right now the team that is taking the field is nothing more than a farce being put forth by an oppressive dictator.By allowing the team to compete and defending their practices of censorship, FIFA is not helping North Korea, but rather just legitimizing Kim Jong-il’s tyrannical regime.Politics has no place at the World Cup, and that is exactly why North Korea should not be competing.",http://bleacherreport.com/articles/409122-world-cup-2010-is-fifa-justified-in-allowing-north-korea-to-compete,

Yes, the Cleveland Indians upended not by the Yankees and Didi, Aroldis and Aaron, but by Eliot, Jack, Jonas, David, Jackson and all the other Iron Pigs.The United States men’s soccer team lost Monday to Trinidad and Tobago (population 1.3 million) and was stunningly eliminated from the 32-nation, once-every-for-years World Cup soccer championship in Russia next year. In countries as diverse as Argentina, Cameroon, France, South Korea or Croatia, such a pitiful performance against a terrible team already out of the competition would be front-page news and cause for major change in a national soccer program’s strategy and officials, including the coach. There’d be hell to pay.And here? There’s a rolling of eyes and yawns, that’s it. The dismal failure was buried in most sports sections and reminds how media indifference plays a part in the sorry state of soccer at the international competitive level. For decades one has read tales of the sport’s rise in America, the increasing number of youth playing the sport (like my two kids) and the improvements in the U.S. national team, be it the men or women. The women are indeed strong, though attempts at pro leagues for them fail. The men just stink. The press fills sections with the MLB playoffs, serves as de facto marketer for the NFL with scads of football coverage, and now offers lots of pre-season NBA stories and early NHL season stories.Dan McGrath, the former sports editor of the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times, says that, yes, “soccer is not in the wheelhouse of many sports editors/reporters/columnists, maybe because we didn’t grow up playing it or following it, really, and we don’t feel comfortable analyzing or even commenting on a game with which we’re not familiar. Thus there’s not a great drumbeat/demand from the media for change. We don’t even pretend to know what’s amiss, which is certainly not the case in other more ‘mainstream’ sports.”“When it comes to soccer, the reality is that mediocrity begets apathy on the part of fans and sports editors,” says Tim Franklin, former editor in chief of the Indianapolis Star, Orlando Sentinel and Baltimore Sun, as well as being the creator of a sports journalism program at Indiana University and the onetime head of the Poynter Institute.“There’s also no huge, transcendent personality in men’s soccer at the moment,” says Franklin, who is Senior Associate Dean at the Medill Journalism School at Northwestern Univeristy “So you combine these two things, and I don’t see any organic pressure emerging to demand change.”“The niche sport status reduces the amount of pressure on the organization (that runs soccer in the U.S.),” says Malcolm Moran, a former New York Times sportswriter who followed in Franklin’s footsteps at Indiana and now directs what’s called the National Sports Journalism Center.He recalls the state of what’s called USA Basketball. When we lost the gold medal game at the Pan Am Games in 1987, and an Olympic semifinal to the Soviets in Seoul, there was substantial media pressure to abandon the traditional reliance on college players. Yes, the international basketball federation craved the inclusion of world-famous NBA stars at the Olympics. But the media attention drawn by high profile defeats was in the mix that prompted change.The NBA joined the global throng as Michael Jordan and the “Dream Team” played at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. The U.S. wiped the floor with their opponents and accelerated interest in the sport worldwide. And while there were subsequent low points for the U.S., press pressure can partly explain an administrative overhaul that brought the hiring of Duke University’s famous Mike Krzyzewski as coach of the national team.Writing about the U.S. soccer debacle on ESPN.com, soccer reporter Jeff Carlisle says, “Moving forward will require a painful examination of the past, as well as stewing in the colossal failure that this World Cup qualifying cycle represents. However, not everyone seems to think drastic changes are needed.”More relevant, precious few seem to care.Tuesday’s Tweet of the Day was this: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”The press has thrown out many comparisons to Richard Nixon, most of them wrong and including likening the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey to Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre.” Well, broaching the yanking of licenses is actually vaguely Nixonian, as explained here.“The good news is that Trump is so ignorant that he doesn’t understand that networks are not licensed, and that the broadcasting industry has obtained legislation that makes it impossible to challenge licenses for the stations that the networks own,” says Andrew Jay Schwartzman of Georgetown University Law Center.“The bad news is that the President of the United States is ignorant, and even his toothless threats do serious harm to First Amendment values.”His staunchest defenders’ reaction? Oh, yeah, he got the network stuff wrong but, heck, he’s just joshing, was the line of Trump & Friends this morning.More than 3,000 attended the Online News Association annual meeting in Washington with a “focus is on tools and practices for working journalists,” notes the Columbia Journalism Review. In the end, “It was disappointing that the wide-ranging conversations in journalism were passed over in favor of the micro-level fixes. Notably absent were the larger conversations happening in other sectors, such as the role of social media in the election, the future of free speech online, and how to report on tech companies. As Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, said, now that “some of the biggest issues of our age are central to the practice of journalism in a digital environment, one might argue that the conference could benefit from focusing on connecting the conversation about much broader areas of policy and practice.”Why we may all be to blame for the Dove soap controversyThat ad in which a black female appears to morph into a white female?  Here’s a theory in Adweek that the hoopla may be a “product of overly short ads and even shorter attention spans,” all the more so in an era in which social media seems to make a penchant to outrage quite the norm.Can fact-checking soften either side in the Israeli-Palinstinean conflict?As Poynter details, a study co-authored by Brendan Nyhan at Dartmouth College and Thomas Zeitzoff at American University ”seeks to explain whether or not corrective information affects the views Jewish Israelis hold about the conflict with Palestine.”“We wanted to see why people believe these misperceptions and how effective corrective information might be in changing people’s minds,” says Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth who’s among a growing group of social media-savvy academics. “We were also interested whether feelings of a lack of control could contribute to beliefs in historical misperceptions, especially those with conspiratorial flavor.”So an online group of 2,170 Jewish Israelis ages 18 or older either got a totally extremist message, which denied Israeli wrongdoing in the 1948 Palestinian exodus, or the same message with important  corrective information. Cut to the chase: “Overall, the findings were encouraging for fact-checkers. While the proportion of denialist Jewish Israelis increased by 8 percent from the baseline to the low control, uncorrected condition, the prevalence of denialism decreased by between 5 and 11 percent for the inverse conditions.”As they summarize in their paper: “What makes people deny wrongdoing that their group has inﬂicted on others? Prior research argues that refusing to acknowledge past misbehavior contributes to intergroup conﬂict, making historical misinformation important to understand and address. In particular, feeling a lack of control may make people more vulnerable to these misperceptions—a claim we test in a preregistered survey experiment examining beliefs about thePalestinian exodus during the creation of the state of Israel. Consistent with expectations, Jewish Israelis who were asked to recall an event in which they lacked control were more vulnerable to arguments (incorrectly)denying any Jewish responsibility for the exodus. By contrast, corrective information successfully reduced misperceptions regardless of feelings of control. However, corrections had no effect on attitudes toward the out group or support for the peace process, which suggests that historical misperceptions may be more of a symptom of intergroup conﬂict than a cause of its persistence.”Appearing on the show of Sean Hannity, his pro bono publicist, the President exulted over his latest tax plan and also declared, “The country, we took it over, the last eight years they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed More than $10 trillion. Right? We picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months. In terms of value. You can say in one sense, we are really increasing values and may be in the sense, we are reducing debt. We are very honored by it and very, very happy by what’s happening in Wall Street.”An increase in stock prices reduces the national debt? This goes beyond being in need of fact-checking. It’s gibberish. Perhaps stupidity is more transparent than mere deceit. This is unsettling.“It’s a question that pops up pretty much every time that Donald Trump deletes a tweet: Is he violating the Presidential Records Act?” asks the Hollywood Reporter.“In a court filing, not only do attorneys at the Justice Department say that courts can’t review this, but they also argue that when it comes to laws pertaining to government record-keeping, judicial review would be inappropriate even if Trump deleted secret recordings with administration officials or even if his staff purged phone records because they expected to be subpoenaed in connection with various investigations.”In case you don’t know any senators from Nebraska“Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse questioned whether Trump was upholding his presidential oath to protect the constitution by making the threats on the media,” writes the New York Post.“Amazon has replaced Google as the corporate boogeyman. Amazon was mentioned 2,090 times this year on publicly available corporate conference calls (including earnings calls, shareholder meetings, and guidance calls), up 11 percent from last year, according to an analysis of FactSet data, which goes through Oct. 11, 2017. Google (or Alphabet) was mentioned in about 1,500 company conference calls, down 19 percent from 2016.”The two companies are on everybody’s mind, counsels Recode, ”because it can seem like both have their hands in everything.”You can argue that it’s been short-thrifted on the amount of coverage but here’s one disclosure you can’t avoid: “Four deaths in Hurricane Maria’s aftermath are being investigated as possible cases of a disease spread by animals’ urine, Puerto Rico’s governor said Wednesday amid concerns about islanders’ exposure to contaminated water.”“He’s putting the press on notice because the press is never held to consequences, he feels, when they put out wrong information,” and he feels the NBC story on wanting to hike the size of the nuclear arsenal ten-fold is wrong, said Steve Doocy, co-host of Trump & Friends, this morning.ABC World News with David Muir opened with “Several breaking stories as we come on the air. The deadly infernos in  California. . . .also breaking tonight new images of Harvey Weinstein just in. . . .a major development in the Las Vegas massacre. . . tonight the President firing back. . and ten students in the alleged hazing death of a fellow student, using the code words, “Bible study.”And Lester Holt of NBC opened with very much a carbon copy: “Inside the Inferno as the fire disaster doubles in California. . . NBC News exclusive: What President Trump said about nuclear weapons that stunned the room before sources say the secretary of state call him a moron. . . Hazing death charges. . . New fallout as one of Harvey Weinstein’s accusers tells her story to NBC News.Meanwhile “Vice News Tonight” on HBO did a low-key feature on the wildfires, absent the tabloid headlines of its broadcast competitors, and per usual gave us a rather broader sense of the world: Another ISIS stronghold folds, developments in Congress on backing the Iran nuke deal, an update on Puerto Rico still only having minimal electricity, the Navy relieving two of the USS John McCain’s top officers of duty after that ship collision it deems preventable, a judge letting the Dakota Access Pipeline to keep running, a profile of a key former ATF bureaucrat who decided that bump stocks shouldn’t be regulated (the Washington Post broke the original tale of his role), and the ambiguous recent history of nuclear disarmament as seen against the backdrop of current tensions with North Korea and Russia, as well as the aging U.S. nuclear system.As Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg does fence-mending on Capitol Hill as a result of a probe of Russian social media influence, boss Mark Zuckerberg “announced an ambitious goal of getting a billion people into virtual reality and said he wants to ensure the technology is “a force for good.’”Robert Byers, executive editor of the 50-person, 40,000-circulation Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia, spoke to me about the mindset of West Virginians who get lied to by President Trump (and other state politicians, both Republicans and Democrats). There’s really a desperate craving to believe that coal jobs will return, which they won’t, says Byers, whose paper won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting this year as a result of work on the state’s opioids epidemic.“Well, I don’t speak on behalf of all West Virginians. But the closer your livelihood is to the coal industry, the more you will believe that. It’s important to you and your livelihood. You want to have that hope. My own father, when there was a fire at the mine he worked and it closed, held out hope because company kept saying, ‘We might be able to reopen’ and he might be able to get that good paying job back. There are people serious about diversification (of energy sources) and not believing such claims. But a lot of people do want to believe people like Donald Trump.”The day before the EPA chief Scott Pruitt signaled the demise of a key Obama-era environmental stricture.

North Korea is telling its people that their mens national team is in the World Cup final.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/17/blog-posting/blog-says-north-korea-told-its-people-their-team-m/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,U.S. Men's National Team,"LEIRIA, Portugal (Nov. 14) – On a night that kicked off a new era, the U.S. Men’s National Team drew 1-1 with third-ranked Portugal in the USA’s final match of 2017. The MNT’s young prospects put encouraging performances with 19-year-old midfielder Weston McKennie’s goal highlighting the talent in the team as the United States finished 2017 with a 10-2-7 record.Starting in his first MNT appearance, McKennie gave the U.S. the lead in the 21st minute with a well-placed shot inside the near post, becoming the third-youngest U.S. player in the modern era to score in his first cap. Midfielder Tyler Adams and center back Cameron Carter-Vickers join McKennie in making their debuts for the senior National Team.In a back-and-forth opening 15 minutes, both sides held possession but couldn’t create any real threats. That changed soon after, as the USA strung together a series of dangerous runs before McKennie’s strike (aided by a CJ Sapong pass) gave the U.S. a 1-0 lead. Portugal equalized in the 31st minute on a fortunate shot that slipped under U.S. goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. The teams traded opportunities for the remaining hour to leave the contest a 1-1 draw. The USA’s all-time record against Portugal remains dead even at 2-2-3.The MNT will return to action in 2018 when the team hosts Boznia and Herzegovina for a friendly match on Jan. 28 at StubHub Center in Carson, Calif. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. PT, and the match with be broadcast on FS1, UniMas and UDN.Goal Scoring Rundown: USA – Weston McKennie (C.J. Sapong), 21st minute: Making a run down the left sideline, C.J. Sapong played the ball past two defenders inside to McKennie, streaking towards the net. He maneuvered past one more Portuguese defender, took a few steps to settle the ball and cleverly wrong-footed the ‘keeper to slot him at the near post. USA 1, POR 0 [WATCH]POR – Antunes (Bruno Fernandes), 31st minute: Building up beginning with the ‘keeper, Portugal was methodical in the final third, patiently making moves before sending a long cross from the right to the left side. Upon receiving the booming pass, Antunes volleyed a shot towards the goal from outside the box, where it slipped through the hands of U.S. goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. USA 1, POR 1 FINALKey Saves: USA – Ethan Horvath, 39th minute: After a save, Horvath played a ball to the field, where Danilo Pereira beat Kellyn Acosta to the ball. Running full speed, he blasted a shot at Horvath, who stayed in front and took it in to his chest.USA – Ethan Horvath, 45th minute: As Bruma made a dangerous run to the net, Horvath came out to play the ball, diving in front of the attacker’s feet to push the ball away and stop a dangerous opportunity for the Portuguese.POR – Beto, 52nd minute: Receiving a pass from Eric Lichaj at the 18, Cameron Carter Vickers sprinted towards the end line and sent an on-target cross to Tyler Adams at the far post. Beto dove and got one hand on the ball, just enough to pat it out-of-bounds and maintain the deadlock.POR – Beto, 71st minute: Lynden Gooch played the ball into the box after a USA free kick, finding Carter-Vickers positioned at the far post. Standing a step away from the goal line, he attempted to trap the ball with his chest, but Beto got a foot in to boot away the goalscoring opportunity.USA – Bill Hamid, 77th minute: Antunes launched another booming shot from outside the top right corner of the penalty area and Hamid made an athletic play to leap up and deflect the shot upwards. He finished the play and snagged the ball on its way down to preserve the draw.",https://www.ussoccer.com/mens-national-team,

The Americans have lost at home twice during this cycle of CONCACAF qualification — before this run, they had lost in just two of 53 home matches dating back to 1980.Thankfully, CONCACAF qualification is forgiving enough to allow for these slip-ups, but Friday against Panama, it's do or die time for the team. Take a look at how the USMNT odds of qualification swing depending on the result.Currently, the USMNT sits at fourth in the table in the final stage of CONCACAF qualifying, known as The Hexagonal, one point behind Panama and just ahead of Honduras thanks to a solid goal differential. With a win against Panama, the Americans would jump into third place, and would automatically qualify for 2018 as long as they can take care of business against Trinidad & Tobago, a team they already beat with relative comfort earlier in Hex play.But the last time Panama and the United States met on the pitch, Panama was able to eek out a 1-1 draw, frustrating the U.S. and their attack. Should Panama be able to draw the against Michael Bradley and company again, the USMNT's chances will start become worrisome.Thankfully, there's a lot of history on the Americans' side here. The United States have not lost at home three times during a qualification cycle since 1958, and has never lost to Panama in seven meetings, and has won five of those matches outright.Due to disappointing results in the Hex, it's felt that every match for the USMNT throughout qualification has been more important than the last. But on Friday, the Americans are out of second chances.",http://www.businessinsider.com/usmnt-world-cup-qualification-panama-2017-10,

But it is significantly harder to be convincing when it comes to your allies.Would Americans really risk San Francisco if Seoul — or Darwin — was threatened? This is exactly the strategic calculus going on in North Korea today.The decades of peace created by the Cold War showed us the way to deter opportunistic aggression is to create a tight-knit community of your allies, such as the US did in Europe after World War II.To accomplish this, the US should ensure complete unanimity of message and purpose.There should be nothing unpredictable about their reactions for either their enemies or their allies. There should not even be the slightest hint the US can in any way be decoupled from them.If the US believes this, and their allies believe this, then it is likely their enemies will not be prepared to risk attacking an ally for fear of retribution from the US.Clearly Donald Trump is marching to the beat of a different drum.His Twitter tantrums accusing South Korea of appeasement combined with his demands that allies pay for their own defence are telling the North the US can be — and even wants to be — separated from its allies.It is also telling the allies they cannot trust the US.This is exactly what Kim Jong-un wants.His end game, for now, is to force the US to trade South Korea for a threat against US soil.At some point, he will force the South to surrender to him to avert nuclear disaster and the South will capitulate because they think the US will not risk its own cities to save theirs.Psychopaths do not fear punishment. They cannot be threatened into submission. They can only be destroyed, held at bay or directed down a path of greater reward for them. They are motivated only by paranoia and reward.Kim Jong-un is paranoid the US will do to him what it did to Saddam Hussein and Moamar Gaddafi.The nukes are insurance against that and a threat that can get him the jewel he desperately seeks — a unified Korean peninsula under his control.As with all psychopaths, bellicose threats are water off a duck's back.His strategy is to fan the flames of distrust between allies that should be standing shoulder to shoulder against him. And so far, Mr Trump has done nothing but help.There is absolutely no difference between this approach and the one employed by your psychopathic boss. And the solution is exactly the same: solidarity.One of the proven strategies for immunising a workplace (or any group of humans) against a psychopathic boss is to ensure all members of the team trust each other.When all communication is honest and open and the team cooperates to attain a shared goal, there are no levers and wedges for the workplace psychopath to use. Trust and cooperation will always defeat psychopathic manipulation.Exactly the same is true at the national scale. Kim Jong-un must believe South Korea, Japan, Australia and the US will act as one if any of them is threatened. More importantly, we must believe it too.Mr Trump must immediately stop destroying the trust allies have in the US. Every trust-draining tweet does nothing more than further embolden Mr Kim.He must immediately commence a process of unification of purpose in that alliance. It will be hard for him. He attained power using exactly the strategy being deployed by Mr Kim — divide and conquer.But if the world is to have any chance of avoiding nuclear war, he must build trust. And if he can't, America must find a way to do it without him.Not doing this guarantees war on the Korean peninsula. Doing it will guarantee peace. It won't be a rainbows-and-lollipops kind of peace — it will be a teeth-grinding, edge-of-the-seat peace that is constantly tested.But at least nobody dies.David Gillespie is the author of Taming Toxic People: The Science of Identifying and Dealing With Psychopaths At Work and At Home.",http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-02/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump-like-dealing-with-psychopath-boss/8993184,
There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/,True,True,True,Can not judge,True,True,"Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. ",Are there three times as many solar jobs as coal jobs?,"More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy.In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look.When we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement.The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016.The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one.So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why.One problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies.The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories.The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers.The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low to the point of being fiction, said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council.They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees, Headley said. They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working.While there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing.This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.)This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote.Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use.She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal.We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017, Sinclair said.  Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward.Schneider said, More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. We rate the statement Mostly True.",http://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2017/apr/25/brad-schneider/are-there-three-times-many-solar-energy-jobs-coal-/,
There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/,True,True,True,True,True,True,"Solar employs slightly more workers than natural gas, over twice as many as coal, over three times that of wind energy, and almost five times the number employed in nuclear energy,” the report notes. “Only oil/petroleum has more employment (by 38%) than solar.",There are now twice as many solar jobs as coal jobs in the US,"Putting solar panels on rooftops and arrays is a labor-intensive process. You need people to design and manufacture the panels. Then people to market the panels to homes, businesses, and utilities. Then people to come and install them.It all adds up to a lot of jobs. Even though solar power still provides just a fraction of America’s electricity — about 1.3 percent — the industry now employs more than 260,000 people, according to a new survey from the nonprofit Solar Foundation. And it’s growing fast: Last year, the solar industry accounted for one of every 50 new jobs nationwide.The chart below breaks it down by job type. The majority of solar jobs are in installation, with a median wage of $25.96 per hour. The residential market, which is the most labor-intensive, accounts for 41 percent of employment, the commercial market 28 percent, and the utility-scale market the rest:To put this all in perspective: “Solar employs slightly more workers than natural gas, over twice as many as coal, over three times that of wind energy, and almost five times the number employed in nuclear energy,” the report notes. “Only oil/petroleum has more employment (by 38%) than solar.”Now, mind you, comparing solar and coal is a bit unfair. Solar is growing fast from a tiny base, which means there's a lot of installation work to be done right now, whereas no one is building new coal plants in the US anymore. (Quite the contrary: Many older coal plants have been closing in recent years, thanks to stricter air-pollution rules and cheap natural gas.) So solar is in a particularly labor-intensive phase at the moment. Still, it’s worth thinking through what these numbers mean.One argument you could make about these numbers is that all this employment is, in a way, inefficient. After all, if we want clean energy to take over the world and help us stop global warming, then we need it to be cheap. And one reason solar power remains (relatively) expensive is that it’s so labor-intensive — requiring more manpower per megawatt-hour than any other power source. The natural gas industry employs as many people as solar but provides nearly 50 times as much energy.There’s something to that argument. If the solar industry hopes to keep pushing costs down and become a major US energy source, it will likely need to become less labor-intensive over time. Some of that will happen naturally as it scales up and installations are in place. But pushing solar costs down dramatically will likely mean things like automated plants, robots doing installations, self-cleaning glass, and so on down the road. A truly dominant solar industry might not produce the same stunning jobs numbers.But labor costs are only one way to think about the issue. There’s also a political angle here. America’s energy system is inextricable from policy and politics, and an industry that creates a lot of jobs is inevitably going to have more influence over that process. Coal miners in Appalachia played an outsized role in the 2016 presidential campaign, and the coal industry has been able to lobby hard for legislation and regulations by using the jobs argument.The solar industry doesn’t yet have the same political clout in Washington, DC, that the coal or petroleum industries do. (Renewable companies still spend way less on lobbying Congress than oil and gas firms do.) But as solar installations grow and more and more jobs are created, that’s rapidly changing. Notice that even though Donald Trump and other conservatives have criticized renewable energy, many Republicans now defend the production tax credits for wind and solar — in part because wind industries are now a significant source of jobs in key states like Iowa and Ohio.On this front, one thing to note about the solar industry is that it’s still relatively concentrated by region. California has nearly as much solar capacity as the rest of the country combined — and accounted for about 34 percent of new installations in 2016 — so many of the jobs are located in a state that’s already liberal and concerned about global warming. But even this is slowly shifting. As the Solar Foundation report notes, states like Texas, South Carolina, New Jersey, New York, and Utah have seen strong solar job growth of late:This political story will be one to watch in the coming years. Trump has bashed solar in the past, and his White House energy page makes no mention of solar power anywhere. But if the industry keeps adding jobs across the country — and solar power growth is expected to continue for the next few years, no matter what Trump does on climate policy — it’ll become tougher and tougher for him to ignore. If more and more states have a vested interest in clean energy, climate politics could start to shift, too.",https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/2/7/14533618/solar-jobs-coal,

This is largely due to the construction related to the significant build out of new solar generation capacity,” the report states.It adds that this gap is growing, with net generation from coal sources declining by 53 per cent between 2006 and September 2016, while electricity generation from natural gas increased by 33 per cent and solar by over 5,000 per cent in the same period.In the past year alone, solar industry employment has increased by 25 per cent, adding 73,000 new jobs to the economy, while wind energy employment saw an even larger  increase of 32 per cent. Data in the report shows the overall number of jobs in energy efficiency increased by 133,000 to a total of 2.2 million within that year.According to the report, 6.4 million Americans now work in the energy industry and 2016 added 300,000 new net jobs, which made up 14 per cent of the entire job growth of the US for that year.“The electric generation mix in the United States is changing, driven by the transition of coal-fired power plants to natural gas and the increase in low carbon sources of energy,” states the report.“These shifts in electric generation source are mirrored in the sector’s changing employment profile, as the share of natural gas, solar, and wind workers increases, while coal mining and other related employment is declining.”David Foster, DOE Senior Advisor on Industrial and Economic Policy, said: “This report verifies the dynamic role that our energy technologies and infrastructure play in a 21st century economy.“Whether producing natural gas or solar power at increasingly lower prices or reducing our consumption of energy through smart grids and fuel efficient vehicles, energy innovation is proving itself as the important driver of economic growth in America, producing 14 per cent of the new jobs in 2016.”Mr Trump has made it clear he is not an advocate for renewable energy sources, and there are fears his presidency could be disastrous for the renewable energy industry.The President's first post on the White House website indicated he would destroy the US’s strategy to tackle climate change. Mr Trump suggested getting rid of “burdensome regulations on our energy industry”, including “harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rule”.The Climate Action Plan was landmark legislation introduced by Barack Obama in June 2013, serving as what the government described as a “national plan for tackling climate change”.Mr Trump’s environmental document makes no mention of climate change or global warming – something Mr Trump has said was just a Chinese hoax. The only mention of the environment calls for “responsible stewardship of the environment”, but that refers only to keeping water and air clean.The new President’s manifesto promised an “energy revolution”, which he said he would bring about by unleashing “America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves”.It went on to say that Mr Trump would “reduce all barriers to responsible energy production,” leading to cheaper energy, citing as an example of these barriers Mr Obama’s standards designed to reduce methane emissions.According to an Ernst & Young LLP survey published last month, the US stands to lose its position as the top-ranked renewable-energy market for investors under the Trump administration.The President made clear during his election campaign that “he hates wind turbines and will do what he can to fight them,” Jacob Pedersen, head of equity analysis at Sydbank, said in November.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-solar-power-employs-more-people-more-oil-coal-gas-combined-donald-trump-green-energy-fossil-fuels-a7541971.html,

That compares to 65,971 coal mining jobs at the start of last year, according to the U.S. Energy Department.Leaders of the solar and wind industries say the rural areas that missed out on economic growth under President Barack Obama are benefiting from the expansion of clean energy. And that growth isn’t driving the collapse of coal mining, according to Abigail Hopper, the recently hired chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association.“I reject the idea that there has to be a winner and a loser,” Hopper said in an interview Tuesday at the trade group’s Washington headquarters. “These are good paying, local jobs that the solar industry is creating everywhere.”Hopper is urging the Trump administration to continue to support pro-solar policies, which helped create more than 200,000 jobs in the past decade, with more than 9,000 mostly small businesses that deliver and install panels.“They did it for economic reasons, for consumer choice and for energy independence,” said Hopper, who joined SEIA this month after serving as director of the U.S. Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. “These are all things that conservatives support.”That support hasn’t been a boon for solar investors. The Bloomberg Global Large Solar Energy index has dropped almost 13 percent since Trump was elected, compared with a 6.7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index.The top 10 congressional districts for wind energy are all in Republican-dominated red states such as Iowa and Texas, according to American Wind Energy Association CEO Tom Kiernan.“We’re hiring workers in the rust belt,” Kiernan said in an interview. “We’re helping families keep farms they’ve held for generations. The lifeblood of our industry is in rural America.”As a more fossil-fuel friendly Trump administration takes shape, both executives want the new president to maintain two key federal tax credits that received extensions from the Republican-controlled Congress at the end of 2015. While Trump criticized wind turbines as bird killers during the campaign, his pick for Energy Secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, helped his state become the largest producer of wind power.Wind developers expect to attract $60 billion in private investment under existing tax credits over the next few years as installations ramp up, and will double the power sent to the grid to about 10 percent, from about 5 percent today.That, and the built-in sunset provisions that came with the tax-credit extensions, may help preserve the policies as Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress consider changes to the tax system.“Everyone we talk to says ‘we already adjudicated that in 2015’,” said Christopher Mansour, vice president of federal affairs at SEIA. He said the group would be willing to give up the investment tax credit if the fossil industries gave up their financial incentives too. “If by ’21 everyone is out of the pool, then fine.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/u-s-wind-solar-power-focus-on-rural-jobs-as-trump-touts-coal,

In 2016, SolarCity will hire “quite a bit more” than it will in 2015, Rive says, though he didn’t provide specific numbers.The company’s expansion is indicative of what’s happening within the broader solar industry. More than 31,000 new solar jobs were created in the U.S. in 2014 bringing the total to 173,807—a 21.8 percent increase in employment since November 2013, according to a report released Thursday by The Solar Foundation. This is the second consecutive year that solar jobs have increased by at least 20 percent.The solar industry is still dwarfed by the 9.8 million workers that the American Petroleum Industry says are employed the oil and gas industry. However, the Solar Foundation is quick to point out the industry is starting to surpass some fossil fuel-related job categories.Solar already employs more people than coal mining, which has 93,185 workers, and has added 50 percent more jobs in 2014 than the oil and gas pipeline construction industry (10,529) and the crude petroleum and natural gas extraction industry (8,688) did combined, according to the Solar Foundation.One out of every 78 new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 12 months were created by the solar industry, representing nearly 1.3 percent of all jobs created in the country. Solar companies surveyed for the fifth annual census plan to add another 36,000 employees this year.“That’s just insane,” Rive says. “The solar industry is literally contributing to the job growth of the U.S. economy—and it’s just so understated.”Third-party financing that allows homeowners to lease solar systems, a stabilizing manufacturing sector and utility-scale solar developers scrambling to finish projects before the federal investment tax credit drops from 30 percent to 10 percent on Jan. 1, 2017 has helped drive growth, says Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of The Solar Foundation.The solar job-growth trend has spilled beyond the confines of companies solely dedicated to the renewable energy source.NRG Energy, one of the largest U.S. independent power producers and owner of 88 fossil fuel and nuclear plants, is expanding its solar business rapidly. NRG’s Home Solar group, the residential solar division of NRG Home, hired 500 people in the past 12 months and now has 1,200 workers.“We’re growing explosively in several markets,” NRG Home Solar president Kelcy Pegler Jr. said in an interview with Fortune on Thursday following the company’s investor day presentation.As a result, Pegler’s residential home solar group plans to add “hundreds of jobs” this quarter and will double its current headcount in the next two years.NRG Energy, which employs 10,000 people, reorganized last year into three business lines: NRG Business, NRG Home and NRG Renew. The company (NRG) has a number of other solar-related jobs within NRG Renew and NRG Home, including its power on the go division which was expanded after the 2014 acquisition of portable solar power company Goal Zero.Overall, solar is one of the fastest growing segments within NRG Energy and the NRG Home group, a business unit that also includes the company’s electricity providers, home services, power on the go products and electric vehicle charging, Pegler says.Residential solar’s role in creating jobs is largely under appreciated by the public, he says: “These aren’t just part-time jobs either, these are careers.”",http://fortune.com/2015/01/16/solar-jobs-report-2014/,

It also shows how many traditional fossil fuel industries like coal and oil have struggled to expand in recent years.The U.S. solar industry grew dramatically in 2015, and is expected to continue to do so this year. The industry now employs 209,000 workers after adding over 35,000 jobs last year. By the end of this year, its ranks are expected to grow to 240,000 workers.The solar sector employs 77% more workers than the U.S. coal mining industry does today, according to The Solar Foundation report. The coal industry now employs a little less than 70,000 workers, notes the report.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 185,000 workers employed in the business of extracting oil and gas in the U.S. as of the end of 2015. These workers operate and develop oil and gas fields.However there are still many more workers employed in the oil and gas sectors in the U.S. than in the solar sector. Employment numbers for the oil industry are notoriously tricky to calculate because of the variety of direct and indirect jobs in the field. But by conservative numbers there are still millions of oil and gas jobs, many of them performing support activities for oil and natural gas operations, like exploration, excavation, well surveying and construction.Most of the new solar jobs are for installers who mount solar panels on the roofs of homes. Large employers in the U.S. include SolarCity (SCTY), Sunrun (RUN), and Vivint Solar (acquired by SunEdison. Other jobs in the solar sector include selling and marketing solar contracts, developing large solar projects for utilities, and working in solar panel factories.While the sheer numbers of solar workers is large, it’s the growth rate that’s more impressive. The solar industry’s employment has grown 123% since 2010. It grew 20.2% just over the past year.Last year, the solar sector added workers at a rate that was almost 12 times faster than the overall economy, says the report. In fact, 1.2% of all jobs—or 1 in 83 jobs—created in the U.S. last year were solar jobs.This year, solar industry employment is expected to grow another 14.7%, or 15 times faster than the overall economy’s predicted expansion. Rapid growth is expected to continue for the next couple of years.Just recently, an important federal government incentive that supports the solar sector was extended. Without the extension, the solar industry could have slowed down in 2017 and beyond.The growth in solar jobs is partly due to the drop in solar panel prices in recent years, which makes them more affordable to consumers and businesses. At the same time, companies like SolarCity have created financing options that enable customers to avoid paying the large upfront fees to install panels.While the U.S. solar industry is growing, some of the traditional fossil fuel industries are either contracting or growing less quickly than solar. Over the past five years, the coal mining sector has been hit hard partly because of increased federal and state regulation that incentivizes cleaner electricity, like from natural gas and solar.Meanwhile, over the past year, the oil sector has shed jobs amid rock bottom oil prices. The number of active oil and gas rigs in the U.S. has fallen 61% to 698 compared to a year earlier.",http://fortune.com/2016/01/12/solar-jobs-boom/,
There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/,True,True,Unrelated,True,Can not judge,True,"Jobs in solar energy now outnumber jobs in coal mining and the oil and gas industry added together, says a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency.","There are more jobs in renewable energy than in oil, gas, and coal combined","A word to the burly coal miners who complained that cutting coal out of our energy mix would take away their jobs when the Climate Action Plan was up for debate. Jobs in solar energy now outnumber jobs in coal mining and the oil and gas industry added together, says a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).Solar may be taking away old jobs, but it’s offering new ones. That’s especially true for women. IRENA found that the renewable energy sector employs more women than oil, gas, and coal. In fact, the percentage of women working in solar is rising — up from 19 percent in 2013 to 24 percent of the estimated 209,000 solar jobs in the United States. That’s not yet great — women hold 47 percent of the jobs in our economy. But it’s still a higher percentage than in the bro-topia that is the conventional energy industry.Worldwide, employment in green energy grew 5 percent in 2015, to 8.1 million jobs, while the slump in oil prices that began in the fall of 2015 eliminated an estimated 350,000 oil jobs across the planet.Around the world, the solar industry was the largest renewable energy employer — jobs increased 11 percent between 2014 and 2015, to 2.8 million jobs. Most of those jobs — 1.7 million — are in China, because that’s where most solar panels are manufactured. In the European Union, a decline in manufacturing means that the region lost jobs, but high rates of solar installation in the United States kept solar employment high.One of the most interesting markets for solar is in countries with unstable electrical grids, such as Bangladesh, India, and Kenya. It’s possible that those countries will be at the forefront of adopting small, independent solar systems, in much the same way that Egypt and other countries without widespread telephone access were early cellphone adopters. In North Korea, small, personal solar panels are on the rise, bought by people who need to charge cellphones when the grid goes down.Both the United States and the European Union have accused China of selling solar panels at below-market value in order to drive solar manufacturing in other countries out of business, and have put hefty import tariffs on Chinese solar panels. In response, Chinese manufacturers have globalized their solar operations, setting up solar panel factories in other countries like Malaysia, Thailand, India, Brazil, and the United States.So, good news. IRENA estimates that if nations follow through on the climate pledges made in Paris last year, this upswing is only going to continue. Their estimate?

As of November 2015, the solar industry employed 208,859 solar workers, which is already larger than the roughly 150,000 jobs remaining in the domestic coal industry.",What If All U.S. Coal Workers Were Retrained to Work in Solar?,"The global economy is in a massive transition from a fossil-fuel-based energy system to one using sophisticated renewable energy technologies. For tens of thousands of fossil fuel workers, though, the energy industry outlook is not promising. For coal industry workers, the future looks particularly bleak. However, research I conducted with Edward Louie of Oregon State University offers hope for a better future based on retraining workers. Our study (published in the journal Energy Economics) quantified the costs and benefits of retraining coal workers for employment in the rapidly expanding solar photovoltaic industry—and it explores different ways to pay for this retraining.First, some background on the coal industry: Profitability for U.S. coal-fired power plants has been declining and coal use has dropped radically since 2007—a trend that is expected to continue. This reduced profitably has driven a steep cut in coal plants. The U.S. Energy Information Administration notes that between 2010 and 2012, 14 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity was retired and that a total of 60 GW will be retired by 2020. What these dry government numbers leave out is the effect on coal workers and their families as coal mines close and one major coal company after another files for bankruptcy. Even the world’s largest private-sector coal company, Peabody Energy, declared bankruptcy this past April. And as coal investors have fled in droves to invest in more profitable companies and industries, coal workers have been left with pink slips and mortgages on houses with few buyers in blighted coal country. It is clear that coal is no longer a competitive form of electrical generation.The one energy sector that is growing at an incredible rate is the solar industry—and it is hiring.For decades the solar industry has battled against enormous government subsidies for coal. But because of the tremendous drop in costs for solar technology, solar adoption is now rising rapidly. Bloomberg reports that the American solar industry had a record first quarter in 2016, and for the first time, it drove the majority of new power generation. The U.S. solar industry is creating a lot of jobs, bringing on new workers 12 times faster than the overall economy. As of November 2015, the solar industry employed 208,859 solar workers, which is already larger than the roughly 150,000 jobs remaining in the domestic coal industry. (It is important to note that both of these numbers are severely limited by the data available, but it can be safely assumed there are far more solar workers in the U.S. today than there were last year—and far fewer coal workers than in 2014.)Our study found that this growth of solar-related employment could benefit coal workers, by easily absorbing the coal-industry layoffs over the next 15 years and offering full-time careers.Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we looked at all current coal industry positions (from engineers to mining and power plant operators to administrative workers), the skill sets required for each (for example, specific degrees and amount of work experience), and their respective average salaries. For each type of coal position, we determined the closest equivalent solar position and salary. For example, an operations engineer in the coal industry could retrain to be a manufacturing technician in solar and expect about a 10% salary increase. Similarly, explosive workers, ordinance handlers, and blasters in the coal industry could use their sophisticated safety experience and obtain additional training to become commercial solar technicians and earn about 11% more on average.Our results show that there is a wide variety of employment opportunities in the solar industry, and that the annual pay is attractive at all levels of education, with even the lowest skilled jobs paying a living wage (e.g., janitors in the coal industry could increase their salaries by 7% by becoming low-skilled mechanical assemblers in the solar industry). In general, we found that after retraining, technical workers would make more in the solar industry than previously in coal. However, managers and particularly executives would make less.By identifying the requisite skills to be learned and the various educational programs available, we also calculated the time and investment it would take to retrain an employee. Most coal workers could not simply walk into a solar job; they would need some retraining. But certain positions required less training—for example, a structural engineer in the coal industry would not need additional schooling to work as one in the solar industry. And for some coal employees, the retraining would only amount to a short course or on-the-job training.More advanced positions, however, would require more education. Some solar-related engineering positions call for up to a four-year university degree, which has a large range in costs from $18,000 to over $136,000 depending on the school.Our paper includes appendices that can help current coal workers match their existing job to the best potential fits in solar, as well as what training they’ll need. It should be noted, however, that the costs and specific schools used as examples were just that.The results of the study show that a relatively minor investment ($180 million to $1.8 billion, based on best and worst case scenarios) in retraining would allow the vast majority of U.S. coal workers to switch to solar-related positions. Of course, training times depend on type of job and prior experience.Our paper evaluated four ways this training could be funded. First, coal workers could fund their own retraining. Second, coal companies could fund retraining of their own workers before laying them off. There are several reasons employers may want to consider this—whether it’s because they feel an obligation to take care of their workers, are diversifying their energy portfolios the way some oil companies have done to be more resilient, or want to improve their public perception. It would only take 5% of coal company revenue from a single year to provide “scholarships” to their workers to fully pay for the retraining they would need to move to solar. A third way to fund would be individual states providing “coal to solar” transition programs. And the fourth option is the federal government could fund the retraining.Workers in any declining industry can learn from the coal industry. They can provide themselves valuable job security insurance by preemptively retraining, and there are numerous opportunities for online training (and even working) in a wide variety of fields. Businesses in tangential industries may also want to consider retraining their own workers—electric utilities, for example, can retrain their coal-fired power plant workers for positions involving utility-scale solar farms.The writing on the wall for the coal industry is clear. Price pressure from natural gas, wind, and solar has been relentless. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations to curb pollution continue to raise the costs of coal, and public perception of the industry continues to fall. The growing threat of liability due to inherent greenhouse gas emissions that come from coal combustion may climb to the hundreds of trillions of dollars. Young coal workers, in particular, should consider retraining for a job in solar now.",https://hbr.org/2016/08/what-if-all-u-s-coal-workers-were-retrained-to-work-in-solar,

While in the long run, this will likely be good for both the environment and the overall economy, in the short term, the economic prospects for individual workers can be discouraging. Moving to jobs in the solar industry typically involves a pay cut.“If you had to take another job, in this area especially, you’re going to take anywhere from a 50 to 70 percent pay cut to what the next best thing that’s out there,” says Craig Williams, who works as a foreman at Consol Energy’s Harvey mine, about an hour south of Pittsburgh.“Pittsburgh used to be big on steel. That’s mostly gone now,” Williams says. “We’re one of the last industries around, and we hope to keep it that way.”That may not be possible: 40 percent of coal-mining jobs have disappeared since 2011, and now only 50,000 of these jobs remain. Experts say automation, lower demand for electricity, and, above all, competition from cheaper fuels are killing the industry. Those fuels include natural gas from fracking, and, increasingly, renewable energy.Rob Godby, an energy economist at the University of Wyoming, says one of the biggest challenges facing workers in the coal industry is simple: location. “When you are thinking about coal mining in Appalachia, oftentimes there are generations of families in those regions, and it's just very difficult to pick up and move,” Godby says.Nationwide, coal miners make on average of $35 an hour, Godby says, in part because the job can be so dangerous. In renewables, the pay averages between $20 and $25 an hour. “That doesn't mean you couldn't raise a family on that, but you're a lot closer to the average income in a lot of states in the solar industry than you are in mining industries,” Godby says.For some workers, however, the switch to a job in the renewable energy industry has proved successful. Wylie Koontz, 23, used to work at a coal mine, though as a lower-paid contractor. When he got laid off last year, he saw a job opening with Energy Independent Solutions, a local solar company.“I didn’t like, just mentally, to completely switch,” Koontz says. “It was a coincidence I found this job and it was about the same pay rate that I was making before, so I just went for it. I ended up really liking it.”A steady paycheck, not necessarily the environment, is what attracted him to the job. Koontz says he likes the problem-solving he gets to do in solar, and he could see himself staying in the industry. One thing that did not weigh on his decision: climate change.“I don’t really believe in the whole climate change thing or not,” Koontz says. “I mean, it’s good, it takes the carbon [out of the air] for sure. ... It’s a lot cleaner energy.”Brian Krenzelak, a former roofer who joined Energy Independent Solutions 7.5 years ago, does believe in the mission of green energy. He installs solar panels and trains others to do the job. His wife also works, and the couple has three kids, one in college, with another about to enter. They even have a second home in Florida.“I do well with this company. Very well,” Krenzelak says. “It covers what we need to cover. I'm not becoming a millionaire overnight, but steadily I have been building the nest egg, for sure.”Experts say solar’s boom is being helped by incentives that are scheduled to run out in a few years, and they don’t know how long the surge in business will last. Some companies are reporting lower installations nationwide. But solar jobs in Pennsylvania grew last year by almost a quarter. Energy Independent Solutions is busy. It’s looking to double its workforce of 22 over the next year and a half.“We had to slow the salesmen down at a certain point, we were selling so much solar,” Krenzelak says. “We had to actually slow them down a little bit until we caught up.”Krenzelak likes the idea that his industry is up-and-coming. He says when his crew went on a big installation recently, other contractors were curious about what they do. “So, there were iron workers there, carpenters, union laborers. Everyone’s coming up to us,” he says.For Krenzelak, solar feels like the industry of the future. And when he looks into the future, he likes what he sees.This article is based on an interview from Allegheny Front that aired on PRI’s Living on Earth with Steve Curwood.",https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-06-07/solar-jobs-now-outnumber-coal-jobs-us,

By the end of 2015, it employed nearly 209,000 solar workers, more than those employed in oil and gas extraction.However, the growth in the solar industry was not shared equally across all types of jobs. Manufacturing, project development, and sales jobs have all remained steady over the past five years. Only the jobs in installation increased, from 43,934 jobs in 2010 to 119,931 in 2015.“Employees of installation companies accounted for 22,900 or 65% of the new jobs added in 2015,” according to the report. “The US solar installation sector employs 77% more people than the domestic coal mining industry. Since 2014, solar installation has created more jobs than oil and gas pipeline construction and crude petroleum and natural gas extraction combined.”According to the US Department of Labor, there were just 184,500 Americans working in oil and gas extraction in December 2015 – nearly 17,000 fewer workers than a year ago.While compared to a year ago the number of oil and gas jobs has gone down, five years ago there were only 160,000 jobs in the field. The industry peaked in employment terms a year ago when it reached 201,200 jobs.Last month, there were 191,900 mining jobs in the US, down from 203,700 a year ago.Nevertheless, the US Department of Labor continues to focus on the positive effects of cheap oil.“The average American household – because of gas prices going below $2 a gallon – they had an additional $500 to $800 in their pocket to spend last year. That’s enormously helpful and what happens is they spend it. You have more consumer demand – the business have to hire,” Tom Perez, the US Secretary of Labor, said Friday.“So while certainly we have seen the mining sector suffer an undeniable decline in employment, on balance for the American consumer gasoline below $2 is a boon.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/us-solar-industry-employees-grows-oil-gas,

Solar jobs have increased at least 20% over the past four years and have nearly tripled since the first Solar Jobs Census was released in 2010.In 2016, the five states with the most solar jobs were California, Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, and Florida.Of the 260,077 people employed in the solar industry in 2016, over half (52.7%) were involved in installation. Manufacturing represented 14.7% of solar employment, sales and distribution 12.4%, and project development 13.2% of the total. The most dramatic growth occurred in installation, which saw a 212% increase in the number of jobs between 2010 and 2016, according to the report. (see table and graph below)Perhaps the most interesting finding, from a mining perspective, is how the number of solar jobs compares to other forms of electricity generation. Despite representing just 1.3% of US energy production, Solar employs slightly more workers than natural gas, over twice as many as coal, over three times that of wind energy, and almost five times the number employed in nuclear energy. Only oil/petroleum has more employment (by 38%) than solar, reads an executive summary.

There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/,True,True,True,Can not judge,True,True,"The burgeoning solar industry already employs about 50,000 more workers than coal mining and power generation.","The U.S. coal industry is dying, and retraining workers for solar isn’t easy","Over the next 15 years, the U.S. solar industry could “easily absorb” all of the layoffs occurring in the country’s waning coal industry.That’s according to a new study by Joshua Pearce of Michigan Technical University and colleagues. The burgeoning solar industry already employs about 50,000 more workers than coal mining and power generation—200,000 in solar against 150,000 for coal—and the two sectors are headed in opposite directions. That will generate lots of opportunity for coal workers to find new employment in solar, the researchers argue.Pearce’s team wanted to know how much it might cost to retrain coal workers for jobs in the solar industry. They included everyone from janitors at coal-fired power plants (who they supposed could be trained to take on assembly jobs at solar plants) to miners to structural engineers. Given the cost of training programs, which can run from a single course to a full four-year degree, they suggest the total bill might be anywhere between $180 million and $1.8 billion.That sounds pretty affordable, actually, for retraining such a large workforce. President Obama has, as part of his Power Plus Plan, already put $75 million on the table for retraining coal workers. And the Solar Training Network aims to help train 75,000 people for solar jobs by 2020, though that is not limited to retraining programs, or to helping coal workers specifically.But retraining workers for new industries may be more difficult than it at first appears. As we wrote in a recent piece:A 2008 Department of Labor study that looked at retraining programs involving 160,000 laid-off workers in 12 states concluded, “It appears possible that ultimate gains from participation are small or nonexistent.” A more recent study from the Hamilton Project found that to be successful, retraining programs must be highly targeted at the workers most likely to benefit. In general, that means younger workers with some postsecondary education who are motivated to follow through, and who are able and willing to relocate to places with more job opportunities. Many of the unemployed coal miners of Appalachia do not fit those criteria.And as this analysis in Vox points out, the bulk of the solar industry is currently concentrated in California, far from areas where most coal workers live. Solar companies are unlikely to pull up stakes and move their businesses to Appalachia—and, on the flipside, people don’t simply migrate en masse to wherever jobs happen to be.There are other issues as well. In some parts of the U.S., for example, there is already a glut of solar power. The more solar (or wind, or any other power source) is installed, the less valuable it becomes per unit of energy—an economic problem that places a ceiling on how much the solar industry can grow, unless transmission lines are upgraded so that power can be shipped to where it’s most needed.Of course, not all coal workers need to stay in the energy business. There are plenty of other fast-growing industries hurting for trained workers. Millions of dollars in federal funding are already going toward training former coal workers to become computer programmers, for example. Such jobs have the benefit of being much more mobile. And unlike solar, which will always face competition for market share from many other kinds of power, the demand for coders is likely to remain steady for a long time to come.",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602151/can-we-really-retrain-coal-workers-for-jobs-in-solar/,
There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/,True,Can not judge,Can not judge,True,Can not judge,Can not judge,,Can We Put Coal Miners Back to Work in Clean Energy?,"In August 2016, fewer coal miners were employed in the US than anytime in modern history: just 48,600. A year later, little more than 50,000 miners are working, but the industry is still in dire straits—layoffs and mine shutdowns have led to rampant unemployment in West Virginia, Kentucky and Montana. President Trump has taken credit for the few jobs that have been added, promising to end the “war on coal”—but in reality, the industry’s downward slide is all but guaranteed to continue.In stark contrast, renewable energy—solar power and wind farms especially—are booming. In the United States alone, wind added 15,000 jobs and the solar industry added 50,000 jobs last year, up an incredible 25%. With unemployment crippling coal communities, a seemingly simple solution arises: Why not offer ‘clean’ energy jobs in wind and solar to out-of-work miners?The answer is complicated, but ultimately, whether any state, red or blue, will see a clean energy job boom depends on economic factors, chiefly, whether renewable energy is cost-competitive with traditional fuel sources like natural gas or coal. Steadily-falling prices suggest the green jobs boom will likely continue, in spite of Trump’s environmental deregulation agenda. Unfortunately, the boom won’t reach everyone.The first challenge in bringing clean energy jobs to out-of-work miners is geographic: Solar and wind jobs pop up in places where sunshine and wind are abundant. Sunny California leads the solar industry, with 40% of all solar jobs found in the state. Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota exemplify the potential for wind energy in the Midwest, with a quarter of each states’ total electricity production coming from wind. Even Texas, well known for its oil resources, produced 13% of its electricity from wind in 2016. But could solar or wind jobs pop up in major coal mining states, such as Wyoming, West Virginia or Kentucky?“It’s a mix of market drivers” that determine where solar jobs arise, says Philip Jordan, principal researcher for BW Research Partnership and co-author of the 2016 Solar Jobs Census. “But, the two biggest are... the cost of electricity you pay for the utility and then, what are the incentives and policies to promote solar?” People generally won’t care about renewables unless they’re provably cheaper than how they’re already getting their electricity, Jordan says. Generally, a state needs both natural resources—sunlight, wide, windy plains—and policies that tip the balance in renewables’ favor. When there’s no geographic overlap, out-of-work miners are forced to relocate, which is burdensome.A state like California, Jordan explains, has almost no coal or natural gas reserves (there’s only one coal-fired electricity plant in the state, and the state is cutting down on natural gas fueled ones), so utility prices are typically higher. Transitioning to solar lessens the costly reliance on out-of-state fuel resources, and pro-clean energy policies make renewables even cheaper. California subsidizes solar panel purchases for home owners and gives them money back if their panels generate more electricity than they’re using. This has led to greater demand for solar panels, and a strong supply of jobs. California’s solar push created 24,000 jobs in 2016, bringing the statewide total to 100,000.Contrasting this is a state like Kentucky, with abundant coal reserves. As coal reliance drops nationwide, Kentucky has been hit especially hard: coal jobs in the state are their lowest in 118 years. But solar or wind jobs still aren’t likely to spring up here anytime soon, because there’s little utility demand and few state-funded incentives to get people to switch their energy source. Most US-based jobs in solar are in installation, and there’s no need to install panels if no one has wants to buy them.Overall, coal-dependent states spend the least amount of money on clean energy incentives. West Virginia, for example, generates 96% of its electricity from coal and offers only 11 clean energy incentives, including net metering and tax breaks for wind turbines. Compare that to California’s 264 incentives. Mississippi, Wyoming, Alabama have around 40 incentives apiece, and Pennsylvania has roughly 70.“If you look at where coal is found, those tend not to be really in states that have really sort of aggressive renewable energy policies,” Jordan continues. “So there’s not a lot of solar jobs in those places because there’s not a lot of solar panels. They tend to have fairly cheap electricity because they have abundant [fossil fuel] resources.”A simpler way to put coal miners back to work, then, may be to find them jobs in the oil or natural gas industry. But is that less radical of a change? Geographically, there isn’t major overlap between coal and natural gas jobs. Colorado and Wyoming are really the only oil rich states that also have a sizable coal mining population. And skill wise, Jordan says shifting from one to the other isn’t always easy.“In some cases being close to natural gas jobs may help... but there are few skill sets that would be easier to transfer to natural gas,” he says. “On the whole, for full employment, solar is a better bet as it is pretty evenly distributed and in most cases the retraining is quite manageable.”Jordan raises a critical point: How can miners acquire the skills to start jobs in new energy sectors? As mentioned, about half of all jobs in the solar industry are installation, with manufacturing and sales jobs accounting for another third together. Similarly, installation accounts for a little more than a third of all wind jobs, while a little under a third of the jobs are in manufacturing, and 15% are in sales. What does it take to get a job in the most in-demand sectors?Chris Turek is a project manager and marketing director for Solar Energy International, a west Colorado-based nonprofit that holds solar training seminars across the country. Turek explains that, while they’re enthusiastic about training miners for new jobs in renewable energy, they don’t design training programs exclusively for miners who want to transition.“We try to get them into a very blended work environment,” Turek explains, “because quite honestly once they enter the work force, that’s the environment they’re going to be working in. If we created segmented classes just for coal miners, it wouldn’t introduce them to a lot of the different personalities and belief systems that exist in the solar industry.”SEI recommends at least two or three courses for those applying, coming in at roughly $2,000. The problem, of course, is that many out-of-work miners would struggle paying for this out-of-pocket or qualifying for loans. Still-working miners might fare better, but that would mean working a full-time job while attending training classes. And that’s only feasible if they don’t have to relocate for training. As Turek explains, workers in smaller communities require more training.“When you’re at a small or medium company,” Turek says, “you might do everything from prospecting, site analysis, working with the customer... but you might also be on the roof doing installation as well.”Turek explains that, for smaller communities in Colorado or Kentucky, one solar worker is expected to handle numerous tasks, including prospecting sites for panels, designing and, ultimately installing them. Miners make great candidates for many installation jobs, Turek says, because their safety skills and electrical knowledge are easily transferable.But like all industries, moving up to more lucrative and varied positions in the field requires more training. A miner could easily train for a job at a manufacturing plant “in a few weeks,” Turek says, if they’re on an assembly line doing repetitive tasks. Sales, on the other hand, requires expansive knowledge of pricing, incentives, and local policies.“We find that a lot of times, people are very good on the technical side,” he says, “but if you try to set them in front of a customer to explain the financial aspects of solar... they need some extra training.”Clearly, if we want to put coal miners back to work in clean energy, they’re going to need to be retrained. But who is going to pay for their education?The cost isn’t trivial. In 2016, Joshua Pearce, a Materials Science & Engineering professor at Michigan Technological University, estimated the cost of retraining coal workers for the solar industry. He found that it would cost the five most coal-dependent states between $120 million (“best case scenario”) and $1.1 billion (“worst case scenario”) to do so. An apprenticeship would cost around $18,000, while advanced degrees, enabling miners to become engineers or project managers, could cost over $136,000. The study assumes that lower-ranking miners would pursue apprenticeships, while seniors would go for degrees from top-tier schools.Pearce’s paper explores four ways coal miners could finance retraining for the solar industry. Miners could pay for retraining themselves, but that’s only feasible for still-working individuals who can afford to pay for training and apprenticeship on nights and weekends. Coal mining companies could pay for training, which might be more charitable than we could expect. Finally, the state or federal government could pay for retraining. In today’s political climate, state-level retraining programs seem much more plausible.“At the federal level, there’s definitely some animosity to new types of energy generation,” Pearce says. “Anything that’s novel or new or advanced is under threat in the federal government.”Indeed, Trump’s 2017 budget proposed major cuts to both federal agencies spearheading clean energy research and deployment, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. But even if the most severe cuts go through (which seems unlikely) there may still be hope, as federal efforts to retrain miners have typically come from the Department of Labor. Obama’s Hiring Our Miners Everyday initiative was funded by the DOL’s Training and Employment Services decision. Like the DOE, the DOL faces cuts, but nothing nearly as drastic.Still, if there’s real optimism to be found, it’s on the state level.Jordan points out that several states remain committed to clean energy, openly disparaging Trump’s insistence on delaying the inevitable transition. In the wake of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, hundreds of cities have pledged to transition their municipal buildings to 100% clean energy by 2025. The governors of New York and California have also announced they’re committed to clean energy. Both states want 50% of their electricity to come from green energy by 2030. If these states accomplish even half of what they’re setting out to do, it’s going to mean a lot of new clean energy jobs over the coming decade.The resilience of the energy marketplace means we can expect the green jobs boom to continue, particularly as coal dependence continues to drop and renewables get cheaper.“I don’t know how much of an impact federal policy will have on renewables,” Jordan says. “If we already know that 40% of the solar jobs are in California, if the governor of California continues to promote solar electricity, those 40% of solar jobs are pretty safe. It’s kind of hard to stop momentum if California, New York and New England and, you know, really getting close to a third of GDP at that point, decide that they’re going to continue this push.”And still short of a movement, companies financing retraining have been slowly popping up in coal country. The Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind wants to tap into ex-miners’ electrical knowledge and offer them training as wind technicians. Quick Mount, a solar panel installation company, partnered with SEI to offer workshops in West Virginia.Trump has proven his ability to galvanize the mining community, but if economists are correct, his environmental deregulation agenda won’t restart the coal industry. And if he doesn’t deliver on his promise of jobs, his approval among them could falter. At that point, it’s going to be up to coal mining communities, rich in natural resources and skilled workers, to decide for themselves what their future looks like and how they fit into America’s changing energy system.",https://gizmodo.com/can-we-put-coal-miners-back-to-work-in-clean-energy-1795639397,

This, of course, bodes well for the future of renewables; it's one thing when local governments start purchasing solar- or wind-generated electricity as a political gesture; it's a whole other when the private sector jumps on board for the sake of dollars and cents.Anyway, Dan's article reminded me of a cool tidbit I noticed in last week's Economic Report of the President: While solar may just be gaining traction with corporate America, by some measures it already employs more workers than coal mining.Here's the story in two graphs from the White House. First the decline of big coal, which according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics directly employs about 80,000 workers these days.And now, the rise of solar. While BLS doesn't break out data for the industry, the Solar Foundation conducts a censuslike survey of employers to track employment trends. As of now, it counts almost 174,000 workers.You can argue about whether this specific comparison is fair since, as PolitiFact has reported, other organizations have estimated much higher levels of coal industry employment. A survey by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, for instance, reports that there are more than 123,000 coal workers if you include contractors at mines. Add in transportation jobs, such as the hands who move coal on rail or barges, and the National Mining Association says the industry directly employees some 195,000 Americans.Which number should we rely on? Its a little tough to say. Contractors at mines should obviously be counted. Transport workers are a little trickier, since many of them might still be working if, say, their railroad retooled in order to ship other kinds of freight. But even if you give the trade-group figures the benefit of the doubt, and concede that coal currently supports more jobs than solar, that could change by next year: The Solar Foundation projects industry employment will grow to 210,000 by the end of 2015.Whether that's sustainable is an open question. Most solar workers are hired to do installations. Presumably, as solar's growth rate slows down at some point in the future, some of those jobs will naturally disappear. And, as Grist notes, that day could come sooner rather than later, as an important federal tax credit for renewables is scheduled to expire in 2017. So, from an employment perspective, coal may have a built-in advantage—you need workers to constantly dig more of it out of the ground to burn. Of course, that's also coal's biggest problem.",http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/02/23/solar_jobs_growth_the_industry_now_employs_more_workers_than_coal.html,

Penney Employs More People Than Coal Mines Do,"Donald Trump probably can’t bring back coal jobs, but he’s willing to kill the planet in the attempt. What other jobs would it be more efficient to support with life-threatening legislation?The Washington Post reports that data collected by the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns program shows that there are many, many businesses that provide far more work for Americans than the coal industry does. The most recent year in which that data is available is 2014, so it’s possible that the numbers have shifted.For that year, there were 76,572 employed by coal. Skiing, an industry that accounted for 75,036 jobs, may have overtaken them by now. If not, perhaps the Trump administration could spend $15 billion on building a weather machine to produce more snow, that also coincidentally runs on coal.Other industries that were catching up to coal in employment include nail salons and the ancient art of bowling. Whole Foods alone employed 72,650 and J.C. Penney a whopping 114,000. When was the last time you were in a J.C. Penney? There are, of course, many areas where the distribution of coal mines is far higher than retail outlets, and the loss of those jobs can be devastating to the area. But not as devastating to the nation as it would be if Walmart closed, since data shows they employed 2.2. million people.Considering how much attention coal mining got throughout the election and the subsequent legislation that attacks the EPA and allows the sale of federal land to coal leasing, it feels like these jobs are responsible for supporting every voting citizen between New York and California. In reality, only 30 percent of American electricity comes from coal. In 2015, there were 55,000 jobs associated with solar energy. That’s just slightly less than the 61,170 people employed by florists in 2014, though those numbers will likely fall if we can’t grow anything.",https://jezebel.com/j-c-penney-employs-more-people-than-coal-mines-do-1793896058,

But it’s not -- it’s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco.PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian television network RepubblicaTV. On May 3, 2014, the network posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.)The RepubblicaTV video is time-stamped May 1, 2014. According to the description posted by the network (and using Google Translate) the video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an onslaught of hundreds of migrants to the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected.The 2014 RepubblicaTV video resurfaced a year later, in a July 2015 YouTube post titled, 1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once. It makes no reference to the location.By the time the footage made it into Trump’s ad, both RepubblicaTV’s logo and the 2014 time stamp were no longer visible.Regardless of Trump’s imagery, the Pew Research Center noted last month that for the first time since the 1940s, more immigrants from Mexico are leaving the U.S. than coming into the country. The shift is due to several reasons, including slow economic recovery after the Great Recession that may have made the U.S. less attractive, as well as stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the border.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she did not know the source of the video included in the ad and that she doesn't speak for the video production company.Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over our southern border.

We’re now wrapping up this first phase of the project, and are preparing for the second, where we’ll fundraise so we can apply the same approach to political ads in key 2016 general election battleground states.But first: here are some takeaways from our collection after logging 1,032 ads. Of those ads, we captured 263 airing at least 100 times apiece, for a total all together of more than 145,000 airings.1. Only a small number of ads earned “Pants on Fire!” or “Four Pinocchio” fact checking ratings. Just four ads received the worst ratings possible from our fact-checking partners.Donald Trump’s campaign won the only “Pants on Fire” rating awarded by fact checking partner PolitiFact for a campaign ad: “Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over ‘our southern border.’ However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away,” wrote PolitiFact reporters C. Eugene Emery Jr. and Louis Jacobson in early January, when Trump released the ad, his very first paid ad of the campaign. The ad aired more than 1,800 times, most heavily in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire.Trump also won a “four Pinocchio” rating from the Washington Post’s Fact Checker for this ad which charges John Kasich of helping “Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy.” “[I]t’s preposterous and simply not credible to say Kasich, as one managing director out of 700, in a firm of 25,000, “helped” the firm “destroy the world economy,” wrote reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee.Two other ads received the “four Pinocchio” rating from the Washington Post’s Fact Checker. This one, from Ted Cruz’s campaign, claims that Marco Rubio supported an immigration plan that would have given President Obama the authority to admit Syrian refugees, including ISIS terrorists. “[T]his statement is simply bizarre,” wrote Glenn Kessler. “With or without the Senate immigration bill, Obama had the authority to admit refugees, from any country, under the Refugee Act of 1980, as long as they are refugees and are admissible….What does ISIS have to do with it? Nothing. Terrorists are not admissible under the laws of the United States.”This one, from Conservative Solutions PAC, the super PAC supporting Rubio, claims that there was only one “Republican helpful” who had “actually done something” to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, by inserting a provision preventing protection for insurance companies from losses if they didn’t do accurate estimates on the premiums in first three years of the law. “Rubio goes way too far in claiming credit here,” wrote Kessler. “He raised initial concerns about the risk-corridor provision, but the winning legislative strategy was executed by other lawmakers.”Overall, our fact-checking and journalism partners—the Center for Responsive Politics, the Center for Public Integrity, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and the Washington Post’s Fact Checker—wrote 57 fact- and source-checks of 50 ads sponsored by presidential campaigns and outside groups. (The American Press Institute and Duke Reporters’ Lab, also partners, provided training and tools for journalists fact checking ads.)Of the 25 fact checks done by PolitiFact, 60 percent of the ads earned “Half True,” “Mostly True,” and “True” ratings, with the remainder earning “Mostly False,” “False,” and “Pants on Fire” ratings. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, the other fact-checking group that uses ratings, fact-checked 11 ads. Of these, seven earned ratings of three or four Pinocchios. A series of ads featuring former employees and students denouncing Trump University, from a “dark money” group that doesn’t disclose its donors, earned the coveted “Geppetto Checkmark” for accuracy. Those ads aired widely in Florida and Ohio leading up to the primaries there.The ad that produced the most fact checks and source checks was this one from the very same group, the American Future Fund, for an attack ad on John Kasich. Robert Farley of FactCheck.org wrote, “An ad from a conservative group attacks Ohio Gov. John Kasich as an ‘Obama Republican,’ and misleadingly claims his budget ‘raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder.'” PolitiFact Ohio reporter Nadia Pflaum gave the ad a “False” rating; Michelle Ye Hee Lee of the Washington Post’s Fact Checker awarded it “Three Pinocchios.” The Center for Public Integrity described the American Future Fund as “a conservative nonprofit linked to the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch that since 2010 has inundated federal and state races with tens of millions of dollars.”This ad from Donald Trump’s campaign earned a “Pants on Fire” rating from PolitiFact.2. Super Campaign Dodger, and other creative ways to experience and analyze political ads. Journalists did some serious digging into the downloadable metadata the Political TV Ad Archive provides here to analyze trends in presidential ad campaigns.The Economist mashed up data about airings in Iowa and New Hampshire with polling data and asked the question: Does political advertising work? The answer—”a bit of MEH” (or, “minimal-effects hypothesis”)—in other words, voters are persuaded, but just the littlest bit.Farai Chideya of FiveThirtyEight and Kate Stohr of Fusion delved into data on anti-Trump ads airing ahead of the Florida primary—which Trump went on to win handily, despite the onslaught.Nick Niedzwiadek plumbed the collection when writing about political ad gaffes for The Wall Street Journal. Nadja Popovich of The Guardian graphed Bernie Sanders’s surge in ad airings in Nevada, ahead of the contest there.William La Jeunesse of Fox News reported on negative ads here. Philip Bump of The Washington Post used gifs to illustrate just how painful it was to be a TV-watching voter in South Carolina in the lead up to the primary there.And in what was the most interactive use of the project’s metadata, Andrew McGill, a senior associate editor for The Atlantic, created an old-style video game, where the viewer uses the space key on a computer keyboard to try to dodge all the ads that aired on Iowa airwaves ahead of the caucuses there.

Candidates’ campaigns dominated; super PACs favored candidates who failed. In our collection, candidates’ official campaigns sponsored the most ad airings—63 percent. Super PACs accounted for another 27 percent, and nonprofit groups, often called “dark money” groups because they do not disclose their donors, accounted for nine percent of ad airings.Bernie Sanders‘ and Hillary Clinton‘s campaigns had the most ad airings—29,347 and 26,891 respectively. Of the GOP candidates, who faced a more divided competition, it was Marco Rubio’s campaign that had the most airings—11,798—and Donald Trump was second, with 9,590. However, in the Republican field, super PACs played a much bigger role, particularly those advocating for candidates who have since pulled out of the race. Conservative Solutions PAC, the super PAC that supported Marco Rubio in his candidacy, showed 12,851 airings; Right to Rise, which supported Jeb Bush, had 12,543.This pair of issue ads sponsored by the AARP (aka the American Association of Retired People), aired at least 9,653 times; the ads focus on social security and have been broadcast across the markets monitored by the Political TV Ad Archive.The biggest non-news shows that featured political ads were “Jeopardy!,” “Live With Kelly and Michael,” and “Wheel of Fortune.” Fusion did an analysis that showed that the most popular entertainment shows targeted by presidential candidates and mashed it up with Nielsen data about viewership. For example, Bernie Sanders’ campaign favored “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” while Hillary Clinton’s campaign likes “The Ellen Degeneres Show.”The Political TV Ad Archive–which is a project of the Internet Archive’s TV News Archive–is now conducting a thorough review of this project, which was funded by a grant from the Knight News Challenge, an initiative of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The Challenge is a joint effort of the Rita Allen Foundation, the Democracy Fund, and the Hewlett Foundation.Stay tuned for news of the Political TV Ad Archive’s plans for covering future primaries in California, New York, and Pennsylvania, and beyond, our fundraising for the second phase of this project: fundraising to track ads in key battleground states in the general elections.This post is cross posted at the Political TV Ad Archive.",https://blog.archive.org/2016/03/23/three-takeaways-after-logging-1032-political-ads-in-the-primaries/,

But the footage isn’t as it seems.About halfway through the ad, a narrator says of Trump, “He’ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.” Video footage shows dozens of people streaming across the border, as if they were ants fleeing an anthill.The clear suggestion is that the footage is of the “southern border” between the United States and Mexico.

Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.)The RepubblicaTV video is time-stamped May 1, 2014. According to the description posted by the network (and using Google Translate) the video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an “onslaught of hundreds of migrants to the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected.”The 2014 RepubblicaTV video resurfaced a year later, in a July 2015 YouTube posttitled, “1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once.” It makes no reference to the location.By the time the footage made it into Trump’s ad, both RepubblicaTV’s logo and the 2014 time stamp were no longer visible.",http://americasvoice.org/blog/pants-fire-mexican-border-footage-trumps-new-ad-actually-turns-morocco/,
A Trump television ad shows Mexicans swarming over our southern border.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-first-tv-ad-shows-migrants-southern-/,False,---,False,Can not judge,False,Can not judge,,Has Trump Made Political Ads Obsolete?,"During the presidential primary campaign, the news media have operated as if nothing’s worth covering unless a clip of Donald Trump can illustrate it. Within 24 hours of airing, Trump’s first TV spot—a sloppy, racist rehash showing footage of migrants swarming over “our southern border” in a scene that was actually shot in Morocco—ran at least 60 times on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News as “free media,” and that’s not counting all the network freebies. The real-estate mogul claims that he’ll spend $2 million a week to run this and future spots as paid commercials—though, when a tweet is worth a thousand ad buys, it’s hard to see why he’d have to.The fear among the political class has been that Trump’s thus far ad-less success—based on social media, celebrity, and the press giving him endless airtime in exchange for ratings, could spell the end of presidential political advertising as we know it. Maybe Trump threatens the very infrastructure of big-money fund-raising that feeds modern air-war campaigns, robbing the establishment of the ultimate tool in its war chest. Not to mention campaign consultants of their hefty 15 percent on the ad buys.The lesson has seemed to be that, for the first time in modern political presidential campaign history, TV advertising may no longer matter, or, as a Lloyd Grove column put it, “Donald Trump Destroyed the Political Campaign Ad.”The politicos may be paranoid, but that doesn’t mean nobody is out to get them. The futility of political advertising this season seems to be proven by a single staggering fact: So-called early “front-runner” Jeb Bush and his PAC allies have spent over $100 million on advertising to reach a humiliating 3.3 average in national polls, while Trump averages 35 points and has put up, until now, a mere few hundred thousand.If nothing else, Trump’s first TV ad has finally brought some national attention to his rivals’ commercials, which for months now have been screaming in forests empty of media to hear them. In truth, there hasn’t been much to say about this year’s GOP primary spots. There are exceptions, like the controversial Ted Cruz ad showing his elementary-school daughter reading from “The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails,” or an earlier Kasich spot likening Trump to the Nazis. But for the most part the primary ad campaign has been devoid of the creative ferment of the past few cycles that’s led to masterpieces like “Demon Sheep” and “I am not a witch.”In part, the avalanche of negative ads we’re just now beginning to see are underwhelming because the GOPers are afraid to take on the front-runner. Most of the spots are about jockeying for second or third or even fourth place in Iowa or New Hampshire. It’s already adding up to a cacophony of voices squabbling over ultra-thin slices of the pie—candidates canceling one another out, taking interchangeable shots at one another over who’s too much like Obama, too weak on immigrants, or too inexperienced. And sometimes their insults on the trail slam against their ads, as Christie’s did when he told reporters that Rubio “can’t slime his way to the White House,” while in his latest ad he swears that it’s a “profound moral duty” for Republicans to stand united.More to the point, there’s been nothing yet like Mitt Romney’s serial carpet bombing of one fringe rival after another in 2012, when multimillion-dollar ad buys in successive primary states chewed through pesky diehards like Newt Gingrich until Rick Santorum finally hung up his sweater-vest. The GOP’s party discipline was enforced by those ads, but it was all pretty nasty for Mitt and everybody else. GET A FREE CHAPTER FROM OUR NEW E.L. DOCTOROW E-BOOKTo prevent that from happening again, the RNC has re-jiggered the Republican primaries, curtailing the number of debates and shortening the primary schedule. But Trump has made a hash of those well-laid plans. And, of course, he’s taken to new media like no one thought a Republican capable of. For more than a decade now web ads and YouTube clips have been undercutting the power of national TV. The screens in people’s lives are no longer a campfire America gathers around; now it’s more like an arsonist’s delight. Besides, fire-starter Trump’s tweets and soundbites, about low-energy Jeb or Canadian-born Cruz’s being ineligible for the presidency, may be more effective than the old-fashioned attack ads we’ve grown bored with.So, again, why is Trump bothering to spend $2 million a week on TV spots? Howard Fineman has speculated that Trump is “spreading” around money to keep the local TV stations happy—it’s walking-around money for small-state media owners.The importance of TV advertising may be in a slump, but it could well reassert itself later in the primaries, as the GOP field narrows, and in the general campaign. Hillary is likely to go for traditional, big-budget spots that try to 3 a.m. Trump (or Cruz or whoever). She is the anti-Trump, controlled, cautious, and about as spontaneous as a Galapagos turtle, but always on message. Trump, of course, is erratic, irrepressible, and unpredictable, but that is his message. It’ll be fire vs. water, Godzilla vs. Mothra, the Penquin vs. Batman, fought out by two celebrities of roughly equal mega-wattage. How will advertising bottle what each candidate offers?Trump’s first ad, really only memorable for the “mistake” of confusing Moroccans for Mexicans, was standard fear-mongering style, as cheesy in its way as a Trump hotel lobby.And maybe that’s the real lesson—racism just doesn’t need big budgets or high-production values to work.",https://www.thenation.com/article/has-trump-made-political-ads-obsolete/,

And that is why Hillary Clinton’s June 2 foreign policy speech resonated with me.Clinton, who has her own credibility issues and some of her own foreign policy faux pas to answer for, questioned the wisdom and consequences of Donald Trump’s foreign policy positions from building a wall on the Mexican border, to giving Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia a green light for nuclear weapons, to threatening to leave NATO, to banning Muslims from entering the U.S.But she also hammered on the most troublesome aspect of contemplating a Trump presidency: his disregard for facts and a penchant for personal attacks on any whom he perceives slighting or challenging him.Trump is a purveyor of conspiracy theories, and addicted to exaggeration and outright false Pants-on-Fire statements. These are the same elements that have led us into numerous military entanglements on false pretenses. Lured by lies, fed by fears, christened by hubris, we have launched long-term ventures we later regretted.Mistaken beliefs about the Vietnamese and a false story of attacks in the Gulf of Tonkin led to the Vietnam War. We went into Iraq with mistaken beliefs we could remake the Middle East and false claims of WMDs.Trump considers the National Enquirer a respected news source, citing it for claims Ted Cruz had affairs and his father was linked to Lee Harvey Oswald.Trump gave prominence to the birther movement. More recently he revived the “Vince Foster was murdered” conspiracy pushed by Rush Limbaugh during Bill Clinton’s first term.Taken to court for conning students with Trump University, he went after the judge, accusing him of bias because he was “Mexican.”When the press asked “who got what, when” after Trump boasted about distributing $5.6 million to veterans’ charities, he went on a rant about them being “sleazy.” But the press found out that much of the money, including his own $1 million check, was sent only after the press started asking the questions.When the governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez, didn’t attend his first rally in the state, he blamed her for the state’s economic problems.He said Sen. John McCain wasn’t a war hero and, “I like people who weren’t captured.”It would be an understatement to say Trump has a penchant for exaggeration. Some examples:•Clinton doesn’t do well with women and he’s doing very well with Hispanics.•Footage in his television ads showing Mexicans swarming over “our southern border” was actually from Morocco.•Thousands of Muslims were cheering in New Jersey as the World Trade Center was coming down, but there’s no news coverage, no video, no substantiation of any kind to support the claim.•600,000 people were trying to get to his speech to the Rolling Thunder bikers in Washington, D.C., over Memorial Day weekend but weren’t allowed to enter. “I thought this would be like Dr. Martin Luther King where people were lined up from here all the way to the Washington Monument,” he posited. Organizers estimated the crowd at 5,000 with no lines waiting to get in.•“Syrian refugees are being relocated in large numbers to New Mexico.” Only 10 Syrian refugees had been relocated to New Mexico.Fact checkers have filled their pages showing how false and baseless his statements have been.The PolitiFact fact checkers detected a pattern. Make an “outrageous untruth” charge or statement, get media coverage, ride-it-out, defend yourself with more inaccurate claims, and then take it back, sort of.Trump gives us no reason to believe that he wouldn’t behave like a confidence man in the White House. When Trump boasts, “I can shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters,” you have to wonder how emboldened he’d be to rely on the same patterns in the White House, and who knows where that would lead?Ron Eachus of Salem is a former legislator and a former chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.

The 30-second spot reiterates Trump's call for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the country ""until we can figure out what's going on."" It also promises Trump will ""quickly cut the head off ISIS and take their oil, and he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our Southern border that Mexico will pay for."" Aerial footage of dozens of people rushing across a desert landscape plays as those last words are spoken. The one problem? It's not footage of the U.S.-Mexico border. The fact-checking website Politfact quickly pointed out the footage is actually b-roll of Moroccans trying to enter the Spanish city of Melilla. The footage originally aired on the Italian television network RepubblicaTV in May 2014. Both the TV station's logo and a time stamp that are visible in the original footage appear to have been removed from the footage used in the Trump advertisement. Asked about the discrepancy by NBC reporter Katy Tur, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski admitted the campaign knew the footage didn't depict Mexican immigrants. ""No shit it's not the Mexican border, but that's what our country is going to look like if we don't do anything,"" Lewandowski said. Trump communications director Hope Hicks clarified in a formal statement: ""The use of this footage was intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration. The biased mainstream media doesn't understand, but American want to protect their jobs and families do."" The Trump campaign told the Washington Post the ad is the first of six to eight his campaign plans to roll out over the next several months in Iowa and New Hampshire.

However, the Republican presidential candidate might want to do some major fact checking before airing the next one. Advertisement About halfway through the brand new ad, Trump and his team show footage of dozens of people swarming over a border fence, where the narrator reinforces Trumps plans for immigrants. “He’ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.” It is clear that the ad is trying to imply that the footage is the “southern border” between the US and Mexico. However, Trump might want to refresh his geography skills as the footage is actually from a small Spanish town in the enclaves of Morocco, about 5,000 miles away.  PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian TV network RepubblicaTV that aired the footage on May 3, 2014. The footage is actually documenting Moroccans crossing the border into Melilla, part of the enclaves on the Moroccan coast. The video made its debut in 2014 and resurfaced on YouTube in July of 2015. Both videos show the time stamp and RepubblicaTV’s logo, however they were both edited out when the footage made its way into Trump’s ad. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, “did not know the source of the video included in the ad and that she doesn’t speak for the video production company,” shared Politifact. Trump later released a statement explaining the mishap. “The use of this footage was intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration. The biased mainstream media doesn’t understand, but Americans who want to protect their jobs and families do.” Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski did not hold back when asked about the ad. “No sh– it’s not the Mexican border, but that’s what our country is going to look like. This was 1,000 percent on purpose,” Lewandowski told NBC News. Lewandowski later followed up in an email with NBC News explaining that the use of the “footage was intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border.”",http://yourdailydish.com/donald-trumps-first-tv-ad-features-morocco-not-mexico/,

And what's up with Donald Trump's first TV ad showing a border that's not what it appears to be? WUSF's Steve Newborn checks on the facts with Josh Gillin of PolitiFact Florida. Gun control is back in the news, with President Obama's recent move to bypass a reluctant Congress and try to tighten restrictions on buying weapons. There's a bill in the House that would keep people on the FBI terror watch list from buying guns, but the Republican majority isn't buying it. Congressman Patrick Murphy, who's running for the Senate seat being vacated by Marco Rubio, is joining other Democrats in pushing for tighter restrictions. He recently tweeted a graphic, claiming that ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" Here's PolitiFact Florida's ruling: The FBI maintains what is informally known as the terrorist watch list through its Terrorist Screening Center, which maintains a consolidated file of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" As you can imagine, some critics are uneasy about the government maintaining any sort of list designating people potential enemies of the state, but it’s generally considered a valuable tool for national security. The Democrats’ bill allows for cross-referencing the list while conducting a background check for a firearm purchase. The actual size of the list and who is on it is not public information, but we have estimates: In 2011, an FBI fact sheet said there were 420,000 people on the list. Current estimates have put the list at around 700,000. Since the database pulls information from U.S. and global agencies, only a relative handful — about 8,400 in 2011 and likely around 10,000 now — are American citizens or legal residents. Murphy’s stat comes from a March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which examined how many people applying for gun purchases were run through the FBI’s instant background checks and also were on the watch list. Between February 2004 (when the FBI started keeping tabs on people on the list trying to buy guns) and December 2014, there were 2,233 people on the list who applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed, including three applications to buy explosives. That’s a bit more than 91 percent. There also have been some issues with the terror watchlist database in the past. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist of domestic terrorism designations"" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which has previously led to people with the same name as a person on the watch list being stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Murphy said, ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.""His figure comes from a GAO report that showed a bit more than 91 percent of gun store weapons applications by people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list were approved. There are some caveats to the watch list, including past issues with who is included and why. The report also didn’t distinguish how many individuals are making these applications, or how many people on the watch list potentially buy firearms at gun shows. But experts have told us the report is both plausible and not altogether unsurprising, given how many guns Americans purchase. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True. Next up, coming off his coronation for PolitiFact's ""Lie of the Year,"" Donald Trump is back in the crosshairs of the fact-checkers.  Now the Donald has rocketed into first place in most polls from all that free media attention after one of his frequently outrageous statements, so he hasn't had much of a need for advertising. But check out his first TV ad: But the image that's shown while the announcer's talking about that wall on the ""southern border"" isn't in Mexico - it's about 5,000 miles to the east. Here's PolitiFact's ruling: In a new television ad -- his campaign’s first -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shows footage of dozens of people swarming over a border fence. But the footage isn’t as it seems. About halfway through the ad, a narrator says of Trump, ""He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for."" Video footage shows dozens of people streaming across the border, as if they were ants fleeing an anthill. The clear suggestion is that the footage is of the ""southern border"" between the United States and Mexico. But it’s not -- it’s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian television network RepubblicaTV. On May 3, 2014, the network posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.) Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she did not know the source of the video included in the ad and that she doesn't speak for the video production company. Our ruling Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over ""our southern border."" However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Trump's response: The Trump campaign released a statement to the media: ""The use of this footage was intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration. The biased mainstream media doesn't understand, but Americans who want to protect their jobs and families do."" NBC News reported that Trump campaign manager put it more colorfully: ""Asked about the video, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told NBC News, ‘No sh-- it's not the Mexican border, but that's what our country is going to look like. This was 1,000 percent on purpose.’ "" The ad makes no such clarification, and we believe that most viewers -- in the context of the ad and Trump's past statements -- would conclude that it shows the U.S.-Mexico border, not a border in Africa.

But at a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio offered one we hadn’t heard much about – the possibility that China could blow an American satellite out of the sky.China, Rubio said, is practicing how to blow up our satellites.Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. Regrettably true, Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim.Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft, as Popular Mechanics magazine put it.China’s destruction of its own missile inspired a great deal of international rebuke, said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to Scientific American.The technology China used, known as hit-to-kill, doesn’t technically blow up the satellite, as Rubio had said. No explosives are involved, only the force of impact of a missile-launched kill vehicle.This is the same technology that the U.S. missile defense systems are based on, Grego said. In fact, the U.S. used the Aegis ship-based missile defense system to destroy the USA 193 satellite just over a year after the Chinese test.Which brings up a point worth noting: China isn’t the only one playing this game. Russia and the United States have been testing anti-satellite technology since the 1960s.In fact, when the United States, a year after China destroyed its satellite, destroyed one of its own, cables released by Wikileaks suggest was a mission with military significance.Russia and the United States either have experimented with or deployed similar technologies as China, said Theresa Hitchens, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. Indeed, the Chinese are actually behind both Russia and the United States regarding development of these technologies. Nothing China has tested is anything that the U.S. has not tested before.A further complication: Technologies that can be used to destroy satellites can also be used for benign purposes. Ballistic missiles can destroy satellites – or they can be used legitimately for missile defense. And satellites themselves can be maneuvered to damage or destroy nearby satellites – or they can be maneuvered for repair or refueling, Hitchens said. This is known as dual-use technology.This makes it hard to discern motives. In fact, China has officially said its tests are not aimed at any other country, and it has been a longtime proponent of trying to manage this issue using space arms control, Grego said.But it’s difficult to prove a purely defensive motive when dealing with such dual-use technologies, Hitchens said.We see them doing dual-use experiments and assume it’s for nefarious purposes, and they see us doing dual-use experiments and assume nefarious purposes, she said. This kind of thinking can produce an arms race.Still, experts said it was fair for Rubio to point out China’s development of technologies that can be used to attack satellites, since it’s a threat to national security even if we’re working on much the same thing.The reality is that satellites are increasingly valuable to civil, economic, scientific, and military operations, yet they are physically quite vulnerable, since launch mass is at a premium and no one armors their satellites, and satellite positions are predictable, Grego said.Rubio said China is practicing how to blow up our satellites.For years, China has been pursuing technologies that can be used to destroy satellites (as well as legitimate things). In fact, the Chinese destroyed one of their own satellites in 2007, in a move that was roundly condemned internationally. While the United States and Russia have also been developing similar technologies, and in one case destroyed an actual satellite, that doesn’t undercut Rubio’s statement.

Electromagnetic railguns and high-power microwave weapons are also being developed, according to military expert Richard Fisher. And he claims the push to produce these futuristic weapons is to neutralise US intelligence along with communication and navigation satellites.Ground-based radars would first be used to identify enemy satellites, with precision targeting ensured by a special camera.  And a deployable membrane telescope would then focus the laser's beam on the target, before obliterating it.Mr Fisher said: “The Chinese government would not hesitate to use the lives of its astronauts as a shield to deceive the world about the real purpose of its space station. “Having gained the advantage of surprise, the combat space station could begin attacks against key US satellites, thus blinding the US to the launch of new combat satellites that would attack many more US satellites.” Military secrecy means it is difficult to know the full extent of the laser weapons programmes, which are believed to be capable of destroying enemy satellites in orbit from its position in low-Earth orbit.But published research has provided some insight into the huge levels of government support being pumped into the development of such arms. The idea was first proposed by researchers Gao Ming-hui, Zeng Yu-quang and Wang Zhi-hong in the journal Chinese Optics in December 2013. They claimed anti-satellite weapons will be “very important” in future wars, with the space-based laser systems likely to have a substantial part to play.It is thought the five-ton chemical laser could even be operational as soon as 2023, if the Chinese military which oversees the country’s space programme can fund the research. Mr Fisher added: “As long as China demonstrates its willingness to exploit much of its space program for potential military missions, the US must possess options for at least neutralising potential threats, preferably short of threatening lives.” The news comes just a day after it was revealed China had unveiled its latest military addition to the People’s Liberation Army’s airforce.

Defense Department and Air Force officials met with ULA to discuss the issue prior to the proposal deadline, Work added. ULA’s decision not to bid on the launch effectively ceded the competition to SpaceX.

That was echoed by a panel of witnesses, which did not include NASA officials. Members also used the hearing to criticize NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission plans, while defending continued work on the SLS and Orion programs. [SpaceNews]The countdown to a GPS satellite launch is proceeding this morning despite unfavorable weather. Forecasts call for only a 30 percent chance of acceptable weather at the scheduled 8:38 am Eastern launch time of the Atlas 5 rocket carrying the GPS 2F-12 satellite.

The state would contribute $17.5 million towards the cost of the facility, which would be used by an Airbus-OneWeb joint venture to manufacture hundreds of satellites for OneWeb’s broadband constellation.

[NASA]Satellite operator Avanti reported flat revenue in the last six months, but promised growth in the next six months. The London-based company said it had $31 million in revenue in the last six months of 2015, unchanged when compared to the last half of 2014. However, the company said it expected its revenue to grow by 50 percent for all of fiscal year 2016 because of a growing backlog. [SpaceNews]Harris Corporation plans to make additional cuts at its CapRock Communications unit because of declining demand for satellite bandwidth. Harris said it will reduce staff at CapRock by 20 percent as the unit’s revenue, once $400 million a year, drops to as low as $250 million. Harris blamed the decline on lower demand for satellite services from energy companies due to the sharp drop in oil prices. Harris took a $367 million non-cash impairment charge to reflect that decline.

That is hundreds more satellites than currently orbit Earth, including the dead ones.But as far back as January 2015, when Musk first debuted his global internet project at a new SpaceX satellite factory in Seattle, he noted how China could pose a significant hurdle for his plans.The Chinese government would have to agree to let SpaceX build antenna dishes, or ground links, to send and receive data to and from the company's spacecraft. But that nation routes internet access for its 1.37 billion inhabitants through the Great Firewall, a censorship technology that blocks foreign news, mentions of citizen uprisings (like the Tiananmen Square Massacre), or anything else Chinese officials don't like on the web.Obviously, any given country can say it's illegal to have a ground link. [...] And from our standpoint we could conceivably continue to broadcast, Musk said during the event. I mean, I'm hopeful that we can structure agreements with various countries to allow communication with their citizens, but it is on a country-by-country basis.So what if SpaceX continued to broadcast uncensored internet over China, despite not being given permission?If they get upset with us, they can blow our satellites up, which wouldn't be good, Musk said. China can do that. So probably we shouldn't broadcast there.Musk has good reason to fear the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China.In January 2007, the PLA launched a kinetic kill vehicle — the space equivalent of a giant bullet — atop a mobile, multi-stage rocket.The target was an old Chinese weather satellite called Feng Yun-1C (FY-1C), and the head-on collision between the two objects happened at roughly 18,000 mph (8 km per second).It was an impressive, if frightening, demonstration that echoed the US military's anti-satellite test of October 1985. That US satellite-killing exercise blasted an old solar observatory called Solwind into more than 280 pieces.In the case of China's 2007 anti-satellite test, however, the impact created nearly 4,000 new detectable chunks of space debris.Hundreds of pieces of FY-1C have slowed down enough to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, but some 3,438 roughly softball-size pieces are still zooming around the planet at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. What's more, according to Space News, roughly half of those chunks will stay in orbit until 2027.There may also be as many as 35,000 fingernail-size bits of FY-1C debris circling the Earth which — like so many tiny bullets — even the most advanced ground radar stations can't track, according to Popular Mechanics.In fact, despite the vast distances that separate satellites hundreds of miles above Earth, pieces of FY-1C have already destroyed a Russian satellite and nearly whacked the International Space Station.FY-1C's trash is just one source of space junk, though. Decades of launching artificial satellites into orbit has created an orbiting field of trash that NASA scientists fear is reaching a critical density: when more junk is being created than is falling out of the sky.Efforts are underway to figure out ways to clean up this deadly trash around Earth, including one effort by the Chinese, but it's an intractably difficult task and progress has been slow.So even if China doesn't exercise its satellite-killing capabilities, which it has continued to develop, SpaceX will have to confront the persistent threat of space junk smacking into its giant constellation of internet satellites — and creating even more of a danger if that happens.According to a database compiled by the Union of Concerned Scientists, 1,419 active satellites are currently orbiting Earth. Roughly 2,600 satellites that no longer work are thought to be floating in space, but even factoring those in, SpaceX's planned fleet would be larger than everything already in space.Some of the biggest telecommunications satellites can weigh several tons, be the size of a bus, and orbit from a fixed point about 22,000 miles, or 35,000 kilometers, above Earth.According to SpaceX's FCC application, though, it seems these won't be typical telecommunications satellites.Each satellite in SpaceX's planned constellation will weigh about 850 pounds, or 386 kilograms, and be roughly the size of a MINI Cooper car. They will orbit at altitudes ranging from 715 miles (1,150 km) to 790 miles (1,275 km).From this lofty vantage point, SpaceX says, each satellite could cover an ellipse about 1,300 miles (2,120 km) wide. That's about the distance from Maine to the Florida panhandle.The system is designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, governmental and professional users worldwide, SpaceX wrote in its application.To get the party started, SpaceX wants to send up 1,600 satellites at one orbital altitude, then follow up with another 2,825 satellites placed in four shells at different altitudes.With deployment of the first 800 satellites, SpaceX will be able to provide widespread U.S. and international coverage for broadband services, SpaceX wrote. Once fully optimized through the Final Deployment, the system will be able to provide high bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps per user), low latency broadband services for consumers and businesses in the U.S. and globally.During his January 2015 talk, Musk said the full system would be $10 or $15 billion to create, maybe more. Then, the user terminals will be at least $100 to $300 depending on which type of terminal.And it's all a means to an end.This is intended to be a significant amount of revenue and help fund a city on Mars, he said.A speed of 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) globally would be huge.The global average for internet speed per user in late 2015, according Akamai's State of the Internet report, was 5.1 Mbps second — about 200 times slower than SpaceX's target — with most of the higher speeds tied up in cable and fiber-optic connections.SpaceX also makes the point in its filing's legal statement that, according to a July report by UNESCO's Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, 4.2 billion people (or 57% of the world’s population) are offline for a wide range of reasons, but often also because the necessary connectivity is not present or not affordable.Bathing the planet in internet is one way to get those people online.Here are some more details directly from SpaceX's filing, which are notable:Musk first discussed the unnamed satellite constellation project back in January of last year, later filing for an FCC application to test basic technologies that would support it.At the time, Musk said during the Seattle event (our emphasis added):The focus is going to be on creating a global communications system. This is quite an ambitious effort. We're really talking about something which is, in the long term, like rebuilding the Internet in space. The goal will be to have the majority of long distance Internet traffic go over this network and about 10% of local consumer and business traffic. So that's, still probably 90% of people's local access will still come from fiber but we'll do about 10% business to consumer direct and more than half of the long distance traffic.According to a June 2015 story by Christian Davenport at The Washington Post, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion into Musk's company, in part to support the project. So it's a good guess that if and when the network becomes functional, those companies would partly assume control of it. (Google's parent company, Alphabet, is also working on its own effort to beam internet connectivity from the skies using satellites, balloons, and drones.)The filing comes just two months after a SpaceX rocket exploded during a routine launchpad test. It was carrying the $200 million AMOS-6 satellite, which Facebook intended to license to beam free internet to parts of Africa.SpaceX declined to comment or provide more details on the project beyond its FCC filing, including its projected timeline and how the satellites would be launched (presumably with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets).",http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-internet-satellite-constellation-china-threat-2016-11,

But it was another Chinese launch three years ago that made the Pentagon really snap to attention, opening up the possibility that outer space would become a new front in modern warfare. China at a Glance  Get updates direct to your inbox  E-mail *  By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy  This time, the rocket reached close to a far more distant orbit - one that’s more than 35,000km away - and just happens to be where the United States parks its most sensitive national security satellites, used for tasks such as guiding precision bombs and spying on adversaries. The flyby served as a wake-up call and prompted the US Defence Department and intelligence agencies to begin spending billions of dollars to protect what Air Force General John Hyten in an interview called the “most valuable real estate in space.”  Faced with the prospect of hostilities there, US defence officials are developing ways to protect exposed satellites floating in orbit and to keep apprised of what an enemy is doing hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres above Earth’s surface. They are making satellites more resilient, enabling them to withstand jamming efforts.  And instead of relying only on large and expensive systems, defence officials plan to send swarms of small satellites into orbit that are much more difficult to target. At the same time, the Pentagon has designated the Air Force secretary a “principal space adviser,” with authority to coordinate actions in space across the Defence Department. Agencies have begun participating in war-game scenarios involving space combat at the recently activated Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Centre.  The flurry of activity raises the spectre of a new technological arms race, this one in space, as nations jockey for advantage. The Pentagon is even developing what is known as the “Space Fence,” which would allow it to better track debris in space.  National security officials are not only concerned that missiles could take out their satellites but also that a craft’s equipment could be easily jammed. Potential enemies could “dazzle” sensors, temporarily blinding them, or deploy tiny “parasitic satellites” that attach to host satellites and do their worst. That could lead to soldiers stranded on the battlefield with little means of communication or missiles that would not be able to find their targets.  “We have considered space a sanctuary for quite some time. And therefore a lot of our systems are big, expensive, enormously capable, but enormously vulnerable,” said Deputy Defence Secretary Robert O. Work. Although Hyten and others had long been concerned about the mounting arms race in space, it was only after the 2013 launch by the Chinese that the Pentagon acted with a new sense of urgency.  As adversaries began targeting space, “there was a level of frustration” in the space community, Hyten said. “We just needed someone to say go.”  The “go” came in 2014, when top Pentagon officials, including Work, the deputy defence secretary, made space a priority, saying at a meeting that “if, God forbid, someday a conflict does extend from the Earth to space, what are you going to do about it?” Hyten recalled.  The Pentagon spends US$22 billion on space programmes and is investing an additional US$5 billion in space efforts this year, including US$2 billion for what is known as “space control,” which includes its highly classified offensive programmes. Hyten declined to discuss the ways in which the United States is preparing to attack other countries in space. But the United States has had the capability to blow up satellites since 1985, when an F-15 fighter pilot fired an ASM-135 missile into space where it destroyed an old military observation satellite.  The Pentagon is moving in the right direction, said Elbridge Colby, a senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, because if the United States were to get into a conflict with Russia or China, “we should count on them going into space because it’s so important to us, and it’s quite vulnerable.”  The new space operations centre has been up and running for just more than six months. It had what Hyten called “a very slow start because we just hadn’t thought about it.” But officials have begun running through scenarios and identifying weaknesses in defence, which help officials tear down the walls between different fiefdoms, he said, so communication and planning can improve.  During a recent speech, Frank Rose, assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, said he was “concerned about the continued development by Russia and China of antisatellite weapons.” But he said the United States “is committed to preventing conflict from extending into space, and our diplomatic strategy supports this goal. The possibility of conflict in space is in no one’s interest.”  Part of that is speaking out publicly about a highly sensitive subject. “The fact that the Pentagon is being so vocal, consistent and in some sense you could say dramatic is an indication of how serious the problem is,” Colby said.  When China flew its 2010 missile to near what’s known as geostationary orbit - the orbit where the Pentagon has many of its satellites - that “appears to have scared the crap out of people,” said Brian Weeden, a technical adviser for the Secure World Foundation.  At the time, Chinese officials said they had tested a land-based missile interceptor and denied that the weapon was designed to destroy satellites.",http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/1943056/fearful-after-chinas-anti-satellite-missile-tests,

Jeb Bush's claim that it's never asked about in the presidential debates ring up true? To find out about that and Sen. Marco Rubio's claim that the Chinese want to blow up American satellites, WUSF's Steve Newborn checks in with Katie Sanders of PolitiFact Florida.Click here to listen to WUSF's Steve Newborn talk with Katie Sanders of PolitiFact Florida  Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is lamenting on the campaign trail that no one talks about the national debt. The former Florida governor said during an appearance at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge,  New Hampshire, the debt ""comes up all the time in town meetings ... but it's never asked in the debates. It's really weird. It hasn't been brought up.""  Is that true? Here's PolitiFact Florida's ruling:  Examples of questions about the debt asked during a debate  Milwaukee Republican debate  In the Milwaukee debate Nov. 10, 2015, Fox Business News’ Maria Bartiromo relayed a question from a Facebook user to Ohio Gov. John Kasich: ""We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?""  North Charleston, S.C., Republican debate  In the GOP debate in North Charleston, S.C., Jan. 15, 2016,  Fox Business News’ Bartiromo again brought up the debt. She cited ""the $19 trillion debt"" in a question to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about infrastructure spending.  Bartiromo later addressed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying, ""One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?""  Examples of candidates bringing up the debt on their own  Las Vegas Republican debate  In the Las Vegas debate Dec. 15, 2015, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., used his closing statement to address the debt.  Back in South Carolina  Marco Rubio: ""How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.  Des Moines, Iowa, Republican debate  Paul: ""I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.""  A question about the debt limit  Boulder, Colo., Republican debate  At the Boulder debate, Oct. 28, 2015, CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla asked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about the debt limit, which is related to the larger question of the federal debt because Congress must periodically reauthorize issuing more debt if the country is to avoid default.  Our ruling  Bush said that the debt ""comes up all the time in town meetings ... but it's never asked in the debates. It's really weird. It hasn't been brought up.""  Questions about the size of the debt were most clearly asked in two of the debates, and perhaps that count could be expanded to a third if you include a question about the debt limit. A few candidates also brought up the issue on their own.  We rate the claim False.  Next up, fellow presidential aspirant Sen. Marco Rubio has a more lofty claim - during a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Rubio blasted China as ""practicing how to blow up our satellites.""  Here's PolitiFact Florida's ruling on that:  Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. ""Regrettably true,"" Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim.  Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. ""And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft,"" as Popular Mechanics magazine put it.  China’s destruction of its own missile inspired ""a great deal of international rebuke,"" said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.  In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to Scientific American.  Our ruling  Rubio said China is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites.""  For years, China has been pursuing technologies that can be used to destroy satellites (as well as legitimate things). In fact, the Chinese destroyed one of their own satellites in 2007, in a move that was roundly condemned internationally. While the United States and Russia have also been developing similar technologies, and in one case destroyed an actual satellite, that doesn’t undercut Rubio’s statement.

But all of China's ambitions in space are not so friendly: Over the past decade, the country has been quietly militarizing the cosmos and it's gunning for the United States.Since the end of the Cold War, America has been space's sole superpower, and it's not ceding that status without a fight. But in this hushed race for control of the orbit around Earth, China doesn't need to control everything to win; it just needs to take away the U.S.' strategic advantage. And it's doing so by turning the U.S.' own strength against it.During a period of remarkable technological advancement, the U.S. pioneered, among other things, ground breaking GPS technology, integrating it to great effect in every aspect of its economic and military operations. From guiding smart bombs to smartphones, from early warning systems to surveillance, the superiority of U.S. military and civilian capabilities are heavily dependent upon satellites — making them a high priority target in a conflict.To make matters worse for the U.S., American satellites are largely defenseless and difficult to replace; it wouldn't take much, in other words, to deal a crushing blow to the superpower's military might. Armed with that knowledge, China has been aggressively working on Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon systems.In 2007, China shocked the world when it successfully destroyed an orbiting weather satellite with a specially designed missile. China has continued to perfect its anti-satellite missiles since then, but it has also pursued alternative methods to knock out satellites after it learned the hard way that blowing things up in space creates massive debris clouds that can accidentally damage or destroy its own satellites (see: Gravity).To that end, China's military has invested heavily in jamming technology and cyber attacks along with more experimental weapons like high-energy lasers, and last year China successfully tested a satellite with a mechanical arm that could be used to attack or alter the orbit of other satellites.The space race is on, but in a potential conflict, the U.S. is automatically at a disadvantage given its reliance on satellites; China is not nearly as dependent on space for its military capabilities on earth as its still modernizing military largely relies on conventional weapons.More troubling, the U.S. lacks the ability to quickly replace damaged satellites despite their importance in military operations.In contrast, China currently leads the world in annual space launches. With an arsenal of over 100 satellites in space, it is just a few shy of eclipsing Russia as the second largest satellite owner in the world. The U.S. has more than both combined, but again, it is that dominance that makes the U.S. vulnerable. While China may be rapidly closing the gap, it still remains far less reliant on space.But, in many ways, the U.S. has been its own worst enemy in the military space race.It is common for U.S. Air Force programs to be filled with 80-year-old PhDs and 20-year-old college grads, the insider said. With so few mid-level engineers to properly train new hires and pass on valuable skills, the zero-practice grads make simple mistakes. Additionally, this skills gap has resulted in the loss of critical technical expertise like the ability to conduct complex orbital maneuvers.For the foreseeable future, the U.S. space program is likely to continue to be in a precarious position given looming budget cuts and Congressional wrangling over funding priorities. For the current fiscal year the unclassified space budget is $8 billion, a 22 percent cut from the previous year, and next year's budget would cut more than half a billion dollars from key satellite programs.Without a significant commitment to defending what is arguably its most important and vulnerable military assets, the U.S. will be at a considerable disadvantage in a full-scale conflict. But while the U.S. may be losing the space race to China for the time being, the path to victory is clear.",http://theweek.com/articles/451227/undertheradar-space-race-china--losing,

China has even blown up one of its own satellites with a missile.",China’s Mystery Satellite Could Be a Dangerous New Weapon,"On July 29, a Chinese Long March-4C rocket blasted into space from the northern Taiyuan Space Center carrying three secretive, experimental satellites. Not really all that unusual by itself — a robotic arm reportedly on one of the satellites could be involved in testing for Beijing’s far-off space station program.But once they were in orbit, the satellites began acting very, very strangely.More precisely, one of the satellites, known as SY-7, was moving all over the place and was appearing to make close-in rendezvous’s with other satellites. It was so strange, space analysts wondered whether China was testing a new kind of space weapon — one that could intercept other satellites and more or less claw them to death.It’s not as crazy as it sounds. The U.S. has experimented with anti-satellite weapons, and is even researching how to cannibalize satellites in orbit. China has even blown up one of its own satellites with a missile. That caused an international outcry considering the giant cloud of debris which has come close to imperiling space travel for a century.But a claw might be more discreet.Most satellites are pretty dumb, in the sense that they don’t really move around a whole lot except in a fixed orbit. Doing much more than that requires sophisticated guidance, navigation and control systems to the point where the satellite becomes something more like an unmanned spaceship.Have those things, and you have the rudimentary steps to maneuver in the path of other satellites. Once you’re there, you then might want to use the maneuverable satellite to conduct inspections or repairs — or even potentially attack other (more helpless) satellites.At least one of the satellites launched by China appears to have some form of that capability. On Aug. 16, the satellite known as SY-7 made a major orbital adjustment, dropping down by about 93 miles. Robert Christy, a British astronomer who tracks Russian and Chinese satellites on his blog Zarya, believed SY-7 was practicing docking on a simulated space station — a planned project by China’s space program — or perhaps testing out a rendezvous with one of its companions.Instead, over the next several days, SY-7 suddenly changed course and rendezvoused with a completely different satellite — one that had been up there all along. The two satellites came as close as a few hundred meters.These sudden maneuvers ruled out the trio as simple ocean surveillance satellites, which also fly in formation and which China has increasingly launched to monitor disputed sea territories. For one, ocean surveillance sats tend to fly with big gaps between them — 30 to 120 miles — thus covering more territory. But the trio orbiting now have come as close as two miles. And ocean surveillance satellites don’t move back and forth.Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and author of the sat-tracking newsletter Jonathan’s Space Report, reported that at least one of the satellites wields a robot-manipulator arm developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Could it be an anti-satellite weapon? This would be a satellite capable of impacting with other satellites, destroying them with sheer kinetic force, or detonating explosive charges nearby like a satellite suicide bomber. The manipulator arm could also be potentially used as a weapon, grabbing away and plucking bits off an enemy satellite like it was an insect.Collisions and explosions are also diplomatically tricky. When China blew up one of its own satellites with a missile in 2007, it created a massive cloud of debris around the Earth — most of which will still be there a hundred years from now.But according to Brian Weeden, the satellites are doing what’s called an “on-orbit inspection.” Weeden, who is a technical and space adviser to the Secure World Foundation, would have a pretty good idea — as an Air Force officer he developed tactics for the Pentagon’s Joint Space Operations Center.“If a satellite stops working for some reason, it can be very difficult to figure out what went wrong using ground-based sensors,” Weeden says. “A satellite that can get up close and take some pictures could be very helpful.”If another satellite somewhere in space has a malfunction, an inspection satellite could come to the rescue or at least rendezvous and determine what went wrong.That said, there’s still a fuzzy distinction between a satellite that can inspect another satellite, and a satellite that can mess with someone else’s satellite, he adds. A grabby-armed satellite that can inspect satellites in distress could perhaps turn that arm into a weapon.“One could dream up a whole bunch of dastardly things that could be done with a robotic arm in close proximity,” Weeden says.However, this isn’t just true for only China’s satellites — it’s true for the U.S. as well. America has experimented with several dual-use orbiters with inspection capabilities that could also be used as a potential weapon. In 2009 the Pentagon launched two secretive inspection satellites to scope out a derelict military satellite. The inspection satellites, known as Mitex, were developed by Lockheed Martin and are widely believed to also have the ability to “inspect” satellites from Russia and China.Another Pentagon project, called DART, ended in 2005 when the satellite’s navigation system failed during an approach to an orbiting communications relay. DART collided with the relay, knocking itself out of action and ending the mission prematurely.The Air Force also has a satellite called XSS-11 — currently in orbit — which is essentially a giant camera. The satellite, which is about the size of a washing machine, is designed to maneuver close to other satellites and take snapshots in case something goes awry. The Swedish government has also experimented with a pair of maneuverable satellites called Mango and Tango. And the Pentagon’s blue-sky researchers at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency have been experimenting with a program called Phoenix designed to pick apart dead satellites for spare parts.“The U.S. or Sweden will insist these are in no way space weapons programs,” Weeden says. “But the technology is definitely dual-use, and can raise significant misperceptions when used in a secretive manner.” The same is true for Beijing.",https://warisboring.com/china-s-mystery-satellite-could-be-a-dangerous-new-weapon/,

Brown/AFP/Getty Images)As part of a push to develop weapons meant to cripple the core strengths of the U.S. military, China last week secretly tested an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon.Publicly, the Chinese regime said last week’s ASAT test was an “anti-intercept test” that “achieved the preset goal,” according to Xinhua. According to a letter sent by the State Department to Space News, however, the test wasn’t to intercept incoming warheads, as Xinhua claimed.The recent test is yet another case of China testing its ASAT while not mentioning the nature of the test.In May 2013, the Chinese regime claimed it launched a sounding rocket. It was later revealed the rocket was actually its new Dong Ning-2 ASAT missile.“That was deliberate misinformation,” said Richard Fisher, a Senior Fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, in a phone interview.Fisher said in a phone interview the vague details provided by the Chinese regime on its ASAT weapons likely ties to the sensitivity of the weapon systems.“Control of low-earth orbit is essential to practically any military endeavor,” he said. “Americans are particularly vulnerable because of their reliance on systems that use low-earth orbit.”He said China’s People’s Liberation Army is targeting U.S. space assets in its military planning “to ensure their success in future wars.”A State Department spokesperson told Space News the United Sates has “a high confidence” that China’s recent test was of an ASAT weapon.The State Department letter says “We call on China to refrain from destabilizing actions—such as the continued development and testing of destructive anti-satellite systems—that threaten the long term security and sustainability of the outer space environment, on which all nations depend.”The recent test has a fine tinge of irony. Less than a month ago, China and Russia signed a draft treaty that would ban space weapons. The United States has opposed the draft treaty, which was submitted to the United Nations.Fisher said the recent test suggests China is stepping up its game by launching more sophisticated tests than it has over the last few years.In January 2007, the Chinese regime destroyed one of its own weather satellites using a SC-19 ASAT missile. It created a cloud of dangerous debris that is still flying around in orbit. The test is one of they key reasons why NASA is forbidden from cooperating with the Chinese regime.China’s subsequent ASAT tests over the years have used targets at lower altitudes.According to Richard, the State Department’s response to the latest test could indicate that China has again brought out its SC-19 missile.“The State Department’s statement indicates to me this may be an additional test of the original anti-satellite system,” Fisher said, adding that “China has multiple programs underway to give them capabilities to conduct space combat.”There’s more to it, however. Fisher said “the larger issue is that China is developing a larger missile defense system, and my sources tell me it will likely be deployed by the early 2020s.”He noted that China has thousands of miles of strategic missile tunnels—as Georgetown University students detailed in 2011—in addition to missile intercept systems and related technologies. Taken as a whole, Fisher said, it “equals a very formidable strategic missile capability.”",https://www.theepochtimes.com/china-covers-up-anti-satellite-test-again_838700.html,

This slab of granite, set into the paving as part of a timeline of local history, reads “Russian Satellites: Grammar School Beats Nasa”. Etched into the stone is the distinctive outline of a sputnik orbiter.Kettering Grammar School — like the space race — is long gone. But for a period it was on the front line of the extraterrestrial battle between Washington and Moscow. The Kettering Group — the school’s enthusiastic science masters and their eager pupils — became the world’s foremost amateur satellite sleuths, tracking secret Soviet launches and uncovering the location of a previously secret Russian cosmodrome from the workaday shire town.As the cold war passed into history, so did the group. Geoff Perry, the main teacher and leader, died in 2000. But some of his former pupils never lost their enthusiasm for tracking the orbits of satellites in the skies above us. In 2014, an email from one of them hit my inbox. Did I know much about satellites, it asked? Perhaps I should look into this curious new object?“In May 2014 there was a regular Russian rocket launch that put four satellites up into orbit,” recalls Bob Christy, a former Kettering pupil. “But one of them wasn’t the same as the others.” Three — as had been publicly declared — were Rodnik communications satellites. The fourth, though, was something quite else. Officially it was classified on the Pentagon’s public space database as orbital junk. But then it began to manoeuvre. “It moved away from the others,” says Christy. “And then we watched it put itself on a trajectory to catch up again with the rocket booster that launched it. It was some kind of test.”What exactly Norad 39765 — known also as Kosmos 2499 and Object 2014-28e — is has still not been publicly declared. The Russians do not even acknowledge its existence. But the activities of the mystery “ghost” satellite have given many in the defence and intelligence community pause for thought. “In the last year, the Russians, China and the US have all been testing these kinds of things,” says Christy. “People talk about them being inspectors, but if you have the ability to manoeuvre up to another satellite in space to inspect it, you also have the ability to destroy it.”Indeed, as far as several seasoned analysts, intelligence officials and diplomats spoken to by the Financial Times are concerned, 39765 best makes sense in the context of one of Russia’s most secretive cold war ventures — a programme that is now being revived: Istrebitel Sputnikov. The satellite killer.Space, military officials like to say, is the ultimate higher ground. Since the cold war ended, however, it has been a largely uncontested territory. In January 1967, the US, UK and USSR became the first signatories to the Outer Space Treaty. In it, they committed to keeping the moon free of military testing and not putting weapons of mass destruction into orbit. China joined the pact in 1984. Another 100 states are now signed up.As a result, for three decades, space powers have been able to operate their own satellites with impunity. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, there are at least 1,300 satellites now orbiting the Earth. Some have military purposes. Some are for civilian and commercial use. Most — 549 — are American. European powers are big players too. Russia has 131, the UK 40. But growing numbers are from rising countries. China now has 142 in orbit, India 33.With all this activity, the pax caelestis is unlikely to hold for much longer. Sixty years after the space race began, an orbital arms race is again in development.Military officials from the US, Europe and Asia spoken to by the Financial Times confirm in private what the Kettering Group and other amateur stargazers have been watching publicly. Almost every country with strategically important satellite constellations and its own launch facilities is considering how to defend — and weaponise — their extraterrestrial assets. “I don’t think there is a single G7 nation that isn’t now looking at space security as one of its highest military priorities and areas of strategic concern,” says one senior European intelligence official.“The threat is increasing and this is a major concern,” says Frank Rose, US assistant secretary of state for arms control. “Both Russia and China are developing ASAT [anti-satellite weapon] capabilities to hold US systems at risk. Now, we don’t believe it’s in anyone’s interest to engage in a space arms race . . . We don’t want conflict in outer space. But be assured, we will be able to operate in a degraded space environment. We’ve made it clear that we will do what is necessary to protect the space assets of the US and our allies against potential attack.”Satellites are fragile things: a nudge to their orbit, a tilt of their solar panels towards the sun, a laser blast directed at their sensors or a projectile casually fired into their path are all capable of wreaking permanent, irreversible damage. “We have plenty of vulnerabilities we need to work on and space is one of the most important,” says General Denis Mercier, Nato’s supreme commander, who is charged with adapting the alliance to deal with future threats. “It’s a domain that is going to be as important in modern warfare as any other. We have a responsibility and a necessity to work on it.”Space, says Mercier, needs to be considered in the same breath as sea and air when it comes to defence. While developed societies are becoming more dependent on it than ever before for almost every aspect of their digital economies, their grip on the technologies that have given them global strategic dominance is slipping. And as more countries around the world look to maximise their military advantages, space is becoming the most obvious domain to contest.“This is going to explode in the very near future . . . you already have 60-plus nations who are interested in space capabilities,” says Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow at the military think-tank Rusi. “And with that, there are a number that are developing very serious anti-space capabilities, most notably China and Russia. When you think that western militaries and societies are critically dependent on space, it is an area to be seriously concerned about.”Everything that gives modern western forces their technological and tactical edge over rivals, notes Quintana, stems from space-based systems. These include precision weaponry, drone surveillance and sophisticated real-time battlefield communications. “Even our tanks,” one British military officer says, “depend on our satellites.”The Reaper drones that destroyed al-Qaeda’s leadership would have been useless without satellites; the intelligence on Russian troop movements around Ukraine came from them; and the smart bombs that reduced Saddam Hussein’s military to rubble in 48 hours wouldn’t have hit their targets if they hadn’t been there. Even Barack Obama’s phone calls rely on a specific array of them — the Advanced Extremely High Frequency constellation.But it is not just a military issue. “Space, cyber, hybrid warfare . . . they raise questions of our resilience,” says Mercier. And resilience, he adds, is something that societies, not just armies, need to address.Western intelligence officials can reel off their concerns over what the loss of satellite communications could mean. There are all the things we currently depend on — from the navigation of aeroplanes to our ability to make phone calls. And then there are the things we are becoming ever more dependent on — driverless cars or internet-linked domestic appliances.“In the US, for the military — particularly the air force and Darpa [Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency] — the National Security Agency and the state department, this is now a key area of concern,” says Anthony Cordesman, former Pentagon intelligence chief and now chair of strategy at the think-tank CSIS in Washington. “But the challenge in space is going to affect virtually every aspect of the country’s strategy . . . the absolutely critical point is that in a world where geoeconomics are as important as geopolitics and strategy, we need to worry about the spectrum of vulnerability. It is not just military assets that [weaponising] space is a problem for, but our entire societies.”Almost every cutting-edge technology being adopted in highly developed economies increases their dependency on undefended satellites. According to one senior British government official, the UK’s intelligence assessment is that 67 per cent of the country’s economy is dependent in some way on space-based communications. A report produced for the US Department of Homeland Security in June estimated that at least $1.6tn of business revenues in America were “heavily influenced” by satellites.“Space,” says assistant secretary Rose, “is vital to just about everything we do here on Earth.”The original satellite killer programme was the brainchild of Vladimir Chelomey, the Soviet Union’s chief designer of aviation equipment. In 1960, the Soviets shot down an American spy plane, prompting Washington to reconsider its intelligence-gathering strategy. As the US turned to space, Moscow needed a means to stop it conducting its surveillance unimpeded.By 1967, Russia’s programme was on a firm footing. A special directorate was formed within the general staff with responsibility for “space defence”. Russia performed its first fully functional anti-satellite weapon or ASAT test that year, launching a manoeuvrable payload into orbit where they used it to trial an attack. The principle was simple enough: a nimble, light kill-vehicle, capable of firing a heavy, non-explosive projectile at a designated object in space, and destroying it.Over the next decade, 15 more ASAT payloads would be launched by the USSR. By the 1970s, the Russians were ramping up their testing further. They even sent special armoured satellites, loaded with sensors to measure shrapnel damage, into space to act as targets for their anti-satellite weapons.For its part, the US spent the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s primarily focusing on ballistic missile technology. Systems were developed that were primarily designed to hit other rockets — but some had the capability to reach into space as well. In 1959, a Bold Orion missile was launched from a B-47 Stratojet but only made it within four miles of its satellite target.For the next decade, the US experimented with using nuclear weapons to wipe out enemy satellite arrays but the programme never captured the imagination of the Pentagon’s military strategists. It wasn’t until the 1980s, when CIA intelligence unveiled the extent of Russia’s ASAT operations, that the US took the threat seriously. A programme rapidly developed a new generation of air-launched rockets that could strike targets in outer space. In 1985, the ASM-135 rocket was launched successfully for the first time from an F-15 jet to blow up Solwind P78-1. Three years later, the entire US ASAT programme was mothballed.As both Washington and Moscow became keen to curb the excesses of their prohibitive arms race, Russia’s ASAT programme had also begun to wither. Major General Anatoly Zavalishin, the head of Baikonur cosmodrome, recalled the death-knell for the ASAT programme in his 1999 memoir. He told Mikhail Gorbachev he could conduct all his tests in secret, without the Americans discovering their activities. The Soviet premier, the general recalled, gave a polite and “resolute” refusal.It would not be until 20 years later that satellite killing came back on the agenda — put there by a whole new power.On January 11 2007, 865km above the Chinese mainland, a weather satellite was blown to smithereens by an object blasted into space from Base-27, the Xichang spaceport. Debris was sent hurtling around the atmosphere. More than 2,300 pieces of golf ball size or larger — each lethal to anything it hit — were released into orbit, according to Nasa. At least a third will circle the Earth until 2035. “Have you seen the film Gravity?” asks Quintana, referring to the hurtling mass of spoilage from an accidental collision that spells the undoing of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. “It’s literally like that.”Some scientists have even posited the possibility of a lethal shrapnel chain reaction as a result of future ASAT detonations. The detritus from one explosion could spread out to hit other satellites, which in turn would fragment, and so on. Eventually much — if not all — of the world’s critical satellite constellations would be inadvertently wiped out.The Chinese insisted the project — known as SC-19 — was benign. “China will not participate in any kind of arms race in outer space,” foreign ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao told Reuters. But the effect on both Washington and Moscow was nevertheless electric.In the US, the National Security Council castigated China almost immediately. In private, the Pentagon put its own ASAT capabilities back on the high-priority list and on February 20 2008, it authorised Operation Burnt Frost. The USS Lake Erie launched a missile at USA-193, a national reconnaissance office satellite. The test was a success. The satellite, Washington said, was defunct, and posed a risk of crashing to Earth. Informed observers noted, though, that USA-193 would probably have disintegrated on re-entry anyway. The cost of launching a ballistic missile to intercept it instead was $100m.Meanwhile, amid a broader plan to modernise the country’s decaying military, Russian media began referring to the country’s “latent” ASAT systems in 2009. In 2010, the plan to revive them was articulated. Oleg Ostapenko, the commander of Russia’s space forces, told Itar-Tass, the news agency, that the military was developing a new generation of “inspection and strike” weapons. “Our policy is that there should be no war in space,” he said. “But we are military people and we should be ready for everything.”China has gone on to push further and further with its efforts. In 2008, a highly manoeuvrable nano-satellite, the BX-1 — a 40cm cube — was positioned dangerously close to the International Space Station. Officially the BX-1 is for inspection and observation. But it also has potential as a weapon. Had it been directed to do so, it could have destroyed the space station and killed the astronauts on board.Then in 2013, China launched the Dong Neng — another ASAT interceptor. It currently has three ASAT-capable vehicles positioned in space.Firing rockets into the outer atmosphere is not the only way to destroy things in space. “ASAT until recently has been entirely kinetic, but what we’re seeing a lot more of now is a cyber component to the approach,” says Patricia Lewis, research director at the international security department of Chatham House. “If you can hack into a satellite’s control systems there are plenty of things you can do — turn the solar panels so they fry up in the sun, move the satellite into a destructive orbit, turn it into a weapon to smash other satellites with, or perhaps most insidious of all, you could just insert changes into the data it was transmitting back to Earth, so the operators would act on it and perhaps you could cause even more damage back on Earth that way.”Launching a cyber attack on satellites has three key benefits. Most obviously, attacks do not have to result in an uncontrollable debris cloud in outer space. But perhaps more significantly, cyber is also far cheaper for would-be assailants and, if done well, it can be almost anonymous. This opens up a worrisome prospect for strategic planners — attacks that disrupt or spy on their countries’ infrastructure without the ability to respond and therefore without the prospect of deterrence.Last September, hackers broke into the data system of the US federal weather satellite network, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Information from the satellites is used in everything from daily weather reports to environmental emergency planning and ballistic missile flight navigation calculations. The control systems were protected, officials said, and no critical data were affected, but just two months before, US government inspectors warned in an official report that an NOAA satellite system breach “could have severe or catastrophic adverse effects”. According to two senior cyber security officials, the Chinese were responsible. But there has been no public US government response.“Attacks on satellites,” says one US cyber security official, “are one of the fastest-growing areas of threat. The satellite network is like a great big open back door into almost every nationally important computer network or infrastructure out there.”The US is spending billions improving its defences — primarily by building more capacity into its constellations and improving its tracking abilities. A $900m contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin in 2014 to develop a radar system capable of tracking objects as small as baseballs in space in real time. But there are also hints that the US may be looking to equip its satellites with active defences and countermeasures of their own, such as jamming devices and the ability to evade interceptions.A purely offensive anti-satellite programme is in fast development as well. High-energy weapons and manoeuvrable orbiters such as space planes all open the possibility of the US being able to rapidly weaponise the domain beyond the atmosphere, should it feel the need to do so.The 1967 Outer Space Treaty had one glaring omission: it has no limits on the use of conventional weapons. Even as militaries around the world work hard to build their space weaponry arsenals, many are now wondering whether the treaty needs to be broadened.Just moments after President Obama’s inauguration in 2009, the White House website was updated with a raft of new policy measures, including a desire for a comprehensive international ban on space weapons and anti-satellite technologies. It was a remarkable volte-face for Washington, which, angered by the Chinese test of 2007, was already racing to redevelop its space might.Now, with Russian and Chinese test activity peaking, Washington has become increasingly hawkish. Efforts by the state department to try to secure some kind of diplomatic agreement have been paralleled by a fast-track military development programme. There is no way to stop the weaponisation of space, US military chiefs say, except by maintaining the US’s overwhelming military superiority there. As relations with Moscow deteriorate, and friction between China and the US mounts over issues such as cyber espionage and the South China Sea, hopes of any kind of international treaty for space are fading fast.“You won’t get the Pentagon to agree a treaty . . . but sooner or later Washington is going to have to realise something needs to be done,” says Lewis of Chatham House. “We are only increasing our dependence on space. The Pentagon is envisaging a world of single-country dominance, but these emerging technologies are equalisers. They reduce the gap and they make developed countries the most vulnerable . . . The state department know that. They know the US can’t dominate and in the long run it’s a losing battle. By fighting it, all that happens is you push others to develop their capabilities faster than they might otherwise.”A tangle of diplomatic efforts hobbles on. In Vienna, the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (Copuous) is negotiating a set of “long-term sustainability guidelines”, while in Geneva, the UN Conference on Disarmament is debating a proposal submitted jointly by Russia and China last year: the Treaty on the Prevention of Placement of Weapons in Outer Space (PPWT). In New York, the first and second committees of the UN General Assembly are jointly meeting — for the first time last month — to broadly tackle space security. A Russian resolution known as the “No First Placement” proposal (NFP) is currently under review.There is significant opposition to all three. The Copuous proposal is too broad and outdated. The PPWT proposals are treated with scepticism by Washington and Europe because they ignore current existing ASAT capabilities, while the NFP rule has been dismissed as a Russian ruse. An international pledge for no first placement, one European diplomat joked, is the same thing as a Russian pledge for second placement.Efforts are now turning on trying to strike some kind of agreement before any formal international accord. The EU has a proposal — but it is moving slowly. Discussions on a new “code of conduct” for space, proposed by the bloc, began in earnest in July.“There is an urgent need for something cross-cutting and politically binding now,” says Jacek Bylica, the EU’s special envoy for non-proliferation and disarmament. “Negotiations on any treaty can carry on for decades — it has been decades since the last one was agreed. The problem we see too is that many of the initiatives at the moment are addressing the weaponisation of space in the future but not the real issue right now, which is existing anti-satellite technologies.“What we are proposing is a set of traffic rules for space. It would be a political commitment . . . rules on principles for the operation of all objects in space. But we are facing considerable scepticism.”The EU has its supporters elsewhere. Countries such as India and Brazil — both of which are increasingly dependent on civilian and commercial space activities for their economic development — want safeguards.“We have to focus on the practical,” says US assistant secretary Rose. “We don’t like the PPWT. But we are prepared to work with [the Russians and the Chinese] when it’s in our mutual interests. We see a lot of merit in the EU [code of conduct] proposal, but they’ve had some challenges in the diplomacy there. There’s no silver bullet. But we need strategic restraint.”As with any international effort at arms control, however, it may be that the only way to secure the consensus is for the threat to crystallise. Until a serious incident occurs, some rationalise, the chances of getting powerful militaries to start thinking about their limitations, rather than their capabilities, is slim.“Whether someone would go for an in-space or missile attack, I don’t know,” says Quintana. “But right now in international conflicts, a lot of the activities we see are exploiting the grey areas. Incidents which are deniable, for example. So maybe we’ll see an accidental collision. Or something being ‘misplaced’ in orbit. Something that is an attack, but not something that anyone can necessarily respond directly to.”“It might not be widely known about but it is critical,” says Bylica. “Our societies, our economies, they depend on this. For a long time our use of space was gradual — first it was for national security and then telecoms. But now everything uses it, from your GPS to your ATMs, to things you would never suspect, like gas pipelines. It’s a spectrum. And we are very vulnerable.”Sam Jones is the FT’s defence and security editorNuance and context are key in any space race / From Nick Watkin",https://www.ft.com/content/637bf054-8e34-11e5-8be4-3506bf20cc2b,

China is believed to have conducted similar tests in 2010, 2014 and 2015, leading Pentagon planners to conclude it will deploy these missiles, placing U.S. space systems under constant threat.","When China takes out our GPS satellites, you can thank the Clintons and Obama | Flopping Aces","An article appeared today about China’s out of control space station:China’s first space station is hurtling towards earth amid fears the country’s space program has “lost control” of the module. Chinese authorities have revealed the Tiangong-1 station was falling back to Earth and would enter the atmosphere some time late next year. But while China has attempted to play down the development as simply the end of the mission, experts have warned chunks of the station weighing up to 100kg could cause damage upon re-entering earth’s atmosphere. The developments came as China launched its Tiangong-2 space laboratory earlier this month as it attempts to build a space program.That spurred me to thinking about the Chinese space program. In 2007 the Chinese blew up one of their own inoperative satellites:At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft. It was not the start of the world’s first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. “It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,” says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.This was a low orbit test. The more crucial spacecraft operate at higher altitudes:Some satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft — including spy sats — are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile — yet it can be done. “You’d need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,” says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. “You’d need ICBM-size boosters — hundreds of them.”Those satellites are critical to most of our lives:Well, guess what. The Chinese now have the capability of putting killer satellites in those orbits.Then, in 2013, China tested a missile that climbed to 18,000 miles—high enough to take out U.S. GPS satellites and nearly reaching the military’s early-warning satellites that hang in geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above the Earth. China is believed to have conducted similar tests in 2010, 2014 and 2015, leading Pentagon planners to conclude it will deploy these missiles, placing U.S. space systems under constant threat. “You don’t have a seven-year development plan if you’re not going to make it operational,” Hyten, the Air Force Space Command chief, said last year.This would not have happened by now if not for Bill Clinton and his voracious appetite for money. As I pointed out last year, the Chinese space program was a mess in the 90’s. In 1994 Bernie Schwartz of Loral Space wanted to score a $250 million contract for providing cellular service in China. Then in 1996 Schwartz coincidentally wanted approval to launch a satellite on a Chinese rocket. Call me cynical, but I see the link between those two events. China needed guidance technology to improve their launch reliability and Schwartz wanted to hand it over. Not everybody in government was on board:That concern for American security to the one thing Clinton wanted above all- money. So much so, that Clinton killed an ongoing investigation:Here once again are the timelines of the deal:April 24, 1995: Loral chairman Schwartz gives $25,000 to the Democratic National Committee. June 30, 1995: Schwartz gives $20,000 to Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which provide support for Democratic Senate candidates. Nov. 29, 1995: A Chinese government agency writes Loral, asking for help in getting an upgrade for its dual-use imaging technology, exports of which are prohibited under U.S. sanctions. Jan. 26, 1996: Loral is sold to Lockheed for $9 billion. Once Clinton approved the launch of a Chinese rocket with Loral Hughes help: Feb. 6, 1996: Clinton approves the launch of four communications satellites on Chinese rockets. Feb. 6, 1996: Wang Jun of CITIC, owners of percentages in Chinese satellite companies, visits the White House for coffee and dines with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. Feb. 8, 1996: The White House and Commerce Department begin to talk about the satellite export issue again. Feb. 15, 1996: The State Department gets an urgent request from the White House to speed up the process of switching the satellite licensing to the Commerce Department. Feb. 29, 1996: Schwartz gives $50,000 to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which bankrolls Democratic House candidates. March 14, 1996: Clinton decides to move the satellite licensing function to the Commerce Department. March 15, 1996: Loral President J.A. Lindfelt writes Commerce to say the export of a dual-use technology, known as synthetic aperture radar, is being held up by the Defense, State and Commerce departments. April 1996: Schwartz announces the formation of Loral Space and Communications. August 1996: Chung accounts show an influx of $300,000 from Liu Chao-Ying. Aug. 18, 1996: Chung gives $20,000 to DNC to attend Clinton’s birthday party. Aug. 28, 1996: Chung gives $15,000 to DNC at Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Nov. 5, 1996: New guidelines on Commerce licensing of satellites are published. Nov. 5, 1996: Clinton is elected to his second term as president. Feb. 12, 1998: As Clinton ponders whether to sign another waiver allowing launch of a Loral satellite aboard a Chinese missile, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger sends him a memo saying the Justice Department `has cautioned that a national interest waiver in this case could have a significant adverse impact on any prosecution [of Loral] that might take place based on a pending investigation of export violation.’ But Berger adds that `the advantages of this project outweigh the risk,’ and `it is inappropriate to penalize [Loral] before they have even been charged with any crime.’ Feb. 18, 1998: Clinton signs a waiver allowing Loral satellite to be lifted into orbit by the Chinese.Obama? Well, he’s busy approving the sale of more rope the Chinese can use to hang us:Marco Rubio tried to warn us all that China is practicing to destroy our satellites and the left laughed at him.

There was no threat,’ Lt. Gen. David Buck, Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space, told CNN.‘Can you imagine building a refueller aircraft, or a jet for that matter, with no inherent defensive capabilities? So our satellites are at risk, and our ground infrastructure is at risk. And we're working hard to make sure that we can protect and defend them.’‘We have very good surveillance and intelligence capabilities, so we can see the threats that are being built,’ added General John Hyten, head of US Strategic Command.‘So we're developing capabilities to defend ourselves. It's really that simple.’ Russia has deployed ‘kamikaze’ satellites called ‘Kosmos 2499’ that are designed to get close to their US counterparts and take them out.China’s ‘Shiyan’ satellite is equipped with a ‘grappling arm’ that’s capable of snatching US hardware right out of orbit.In a CNN special ‘War in Space: The Next Battlefield’, screened on Tuesday night, General Hyten said America’s adversaries could soon be a threat from Near Earth Orbit, just 100 miles up and home to the International Space Station, all the way to Geostationary Orbit, 22,000 miles away and home to some of the country’s most sensitive military communications and early-warning systems.‘As humans go out there, there has always been conflict. Conflict in the Wild West as we move in the West ... conflict twice in Europe for its horrible world wars. So, every time humans actually physically move into that, there's conflict, and in that case, we'll have to be prepared for that,’ General Hyten added.Peter Singer, who advises the Pentagon on space threats and authored ‘Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War’, said there’s a clear ‘incentive’ to putting space communications systems out of action. ‘And that means if there was conflict on Planet Earth, it would almost inherently start with some kind of conflict in space,’ he added.The futuristic firepower being worked on by the US include a laser weapons system similar to one currently deployed by a warship in the Persian Gulf but adapted for space, and the X-37b, a pilotless space drone.But another expert says America is still playing catch-up. ‘Could we provide active defence of our own satellites?’ asked General William Shelton, former head of US Space Command. ‘The answer is no.’Nevertheless, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work vowed earlier this year that the US would ‘strike back’ if attacked in space. ‘From the very beginning, if someone starts going after our space constellation, we're going to go after the capabilities that would prevent them from doing that,’ Mr Work told CNN.‘Let me just say that - having the capability to shoot the torpedo would be a good thing to have in our quiver.’",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3986616/America-prepares-war-space-Defense-chiefs-warn-Russia-China-internet-destroying-satellites.html,

The maneuver took place last week and involved one of three small satellites launched in July, according to an article by Bill Gertz, a reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, an online investigative news organization. The U.S. Defense Department has been monitoring the movement of the Chinese satellites, according to Cynthia Smith, a spokeswoman at the Pentagon, according to the report. U.S. Strategic Command’s Joint Functional Combatant Command for Space has observed the relative motions of the objects, she told the reporter. The experimental satellites were identified as Chuangxin-3, which is translated as Innovation-3; Shiyan-7, or Experiment-7, the one believed to have the mechanical arm; and Shijian-15, or Practice-15, according to the article. They were launched in a Long March-4C rocket on July 20 from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China, according to the report. U.S. military and intelligence officials are increasingly concerned over China’s so-called anti-satellite systems. In 2007, China fired a missile into space and destroyed a weather satellite.

The former Hughes chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong, and the current vice chairman, Steven D. Dorfman, testified that their aggressive and successful lobbying to persuade the Clinton administration to loosen controls on Chinese launches of U.S. satellites was intended only to protect the company's multibillion-dollar contracts in China. The executives explained that they resorted to Chinese rockets to launch their spacecraft because of inadequate U.S. launch capabilities. Hughes management and employees have been deeply distressed by the allegations that Hughes engaged in activities with respect to our satellite launches in China that have strengthened Chinese military capability and weakened the national security, Dorfman told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. So much of the company's life, history and future are dedicated [to protecting the United States] that Hughes would never endanger the security of this country, said Armstrong, who interrupted his schedule of deal-making as chairman of AT&T Corp. In recent weeks he has arranged that firm's $48 billion purchase of cable colossus Tele-Communications Inc. and a massive global joint venture with British Telecommunications. The committee called the pair to testify about their successes in lobbying President Clinton, including their 1993 effort to win permission to launch commercial satellites atop Chinese rockets despite the punishing trade sanctions imposed on China because of its missile sales to Pakistan. Senators cited a series of letters Armstrong wrote Clinton. In one, written in October 1993, Armstrong listed numerous issues on which he had supported the president, before adding that he needed Clinton's help on the export matter, lest Hughes lose jobs in politically crucial California. This will be public and political shortly, Armstrong wrote. I'm concerned about people who are very powerful and in contact with the president politically urging him to do something, Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) told him. You need some help in letter-writing. Armstrong replied that he was worried that the satellite restrictions then in place would cause the loss of $1 billion in Chinese satellite deals to Germany, which was precisely what happened. This was all about policy, not politics, he said. Soon after the writing of the October 1993 letter, Clinton named Armstrong chairman of the President's Export Council, a position from which he helped persuade Clinton in 1996 to transfer authority over satellite exports from the State Department to the more flexible Commerce Department. Sen. Fred D. Thompson (R-Tenn.), the committee chairman, said it is understandable that Hughes would move to protect its interests, but he expressed alarm that a company with a huge financial stake would engage in the delicate diplomatic talks with top Chinese officials that it did in 1993. It points out the need for a strong counterbalance [to industry pressure] within our government, he said. Armstrong said he was in close contact with U.S. government officials in all his discussions with Beijing about reining in its overseas weapons sales. Dorfman supported granting the relatively strict State and Defense departments more power in monitoring Chinese launches, especially the contacts U.S. companies have with the Chinese after their rockets blow up and U.S. satellites are destroyed. The Hughes executive pleaded with the senators not to end U.S. satellite deals in China. In particular, he asked for prompt Commerce licensing of a $500 million satellite deal there to create a cellular phone network in 22 Asian countries, despite fears it would strengthen the Chinese military's communications. Delays beyond August could cost the firm hundreds of millions of dollars already invested. It is in the interests of national security to have a vibrant U.S. satellite industry, he said. I strongly urge the members to take particular care when legislating in this area.",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/hughes073098.htm,
China is practicing how to blow up our satellites.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-china-practicing-how-blow-our-sat/,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Chinese Scientists Just Pulled Off Quantum Teleportation From Earth to Space,"For the second time this summer, China’s quantum computer scientists have blown the rest of the world out of the water. In early July, a team of 32 researchers reported achieving quantum teleportation from Ngari in Chinese-occupied Tibet, to the Micius satellite up in space — across layers of interfering atmosphere and 870 miles. That’s about the distance from Los Angeles to Montana.The previous record was about 62 miles — roughly the distance from New York City to Philadelphia.No physical matter or particles were teleported here in the way some people might remember from Star Trek, but what the Chinese scientists achieved is, arguably, even more mind blowing. Quantum teleportation refers to the instant transfer of a “quantum state,” or a bit of quantum information, from one particle to another across a distance.For quantum teleportation to happen, two or more particles have to be “entangled.” In the strange world of quantum physics, this means that they’re really the same particle, even though they exist in two different places. If one is measured as having a certain polarization, the other will have the same polarization, even if they’re extremely far apart from each other.The ability to teleport quantum states is a big deal for quantum computing because two entangled particles can serve as a kind of “password” for sharing encrypted information. It’s not quite as simple as encoding information onto one such that it pops out of the other, resulting in faster-than-light communication (that, so far, is impossible), but it is still incredibly useful.Here’s how, as Inverse reported in June when the same Chinese team first reported sending entangled particles from Micius down to Earth:Without quantum entanglement, the only way for people in two different spots to share a secret password is to send a carrier — a trusted ally, a letter, a pigeon with a tattoo on its feet, whatever — across the intervening distance. Quantum entanglement, in theory, allows interlocutors to go through the steps of secret communication in a bizarre, out-of-order sequence. First, send entangled particles to two different spots and compose a message in one spot. Encode that message using the pattern of entangled particle states on that end. Send it, thus encoded, using normal wires or radio waves. Finally, decode it using the pattern of particles on the other end. No legible information passes between the two spots for others to read, and the passcode transfer is instant.The Chinese experiment is impressive, because, while in theory, two entangled particles can be separated by the whole expanse of the observable universe, in practice it’s pretty hard to make that happen. Standard media for moving photons from one place to another, like fiber optic cables, tend to gobble up individual photons over long trips, ruining the entanglement.Even sending them straight up to space is tricky. The transmitter has to be precise enough to overcome atmospheric wobbling and distortion, and launch a particle directly at the satellite. And the satellite’s receiver has to be sensitive enough to detect the particle arriving.But the Chinese pulled it off — six times. In each instance, two particles were entangled on the ground and one was sent into space. A quantum bit of information was teleported from one to the other. And, once again, China moved a big step forward toward true quantum communication.Abstract: An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectly replicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown quantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous teleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or terrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a global-scale “quantum internet” is to significantly extend the range for teleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite platform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points on the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons’ propagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up to 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric turbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a compact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam divergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking (APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the classical limit. This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-link for faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential step toward global-scale quantum internet.",https://www.inverse.com/article/34027-quantum-teleportation-entanglement-computing-internet-china,

But that would be so Grinch-like. Instead, we rule the statement True.",Do Christmas trees really grow in all 50 states?,"Oregonians are lucky in that we don’t have to think about where we get our holiday trees. We are the No. 1 producer of firs, pines and spruce, beating out all other states in providing the scented, festive trees that grace many homes this season.  Perhaps in honor of that distinction, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley helped pushed a resolution claiming the first full week of December 2011 as National Christmas Tree Week. The resolution notes that there are close to 15,000 farms growing Christmas trees in the United States and that there are roughly 100,000 people employed in the real tree industry.  The resolution also states that Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states.  Apparently, this is a common statistic repeated in Christmas tree fun facts around the country. But we had to think about it. Are there really Christmas tree farms in tropical Hawaii? What about in sunny New Mexico?  The claim kind of made sense -- where else would people living in those states get their trees? -- but we had to check.    Well, it's one of those things I ‘know, but can't technically verify,’ said Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group for real farm-grown trees. He directed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which conducts a census survey of farms every five years, the most recent in 2007.  Oregon led with 6.8 million trees harvested in 2007, out of 17.4 million nationwide. Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming were at the bottom, with zero cut trees harvested. So maybe Oregon’s junior senator had his facts wrong?  We called Catherine Howard, publisher of Christmas Trees Magazine, a trade publication for growers. She said she didn’t know whether there are tree farms in all 50 states, but she suspects there may not be many -- or any -- growers in the Dakotas or in Montana.  You never hear about them; they're just not involved, she said. And, probably, I'm guessing Arizona and New Mexico... it's very hard to grow Christmas trees in the Southwest.    So now we’d stumbled upon new states that may lack tree farms, but nothing definite yet. We continued sleuthing.  There are several websites where you can find a place in your state to buy fresh cut trees. The National Christmas Tree Association did not list any members in Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota or Alaska. But of course, the sites are not comprehensive.  We plugged Alaska into the Christmas Tree Farm Network, and we found Bob Smith -- owner of Bob Smith’s Minnesota Christmas Trees in Anchorage. That’s right. Alaskans have flocked to him since 1962 to buy Balsam firs and Scotch pines from Minnesota.  Smith said he didn’t know of any tree farms in Alaska, either, but there may be a small tree farmer he’s missed. Anyway, why are Christmas trees hard to grow in Alaska? It takes a long time, he said. The ground never gets that warm. They get a lot of daylight in the summer, but they never get that warm.  Next, we turned to the dry Southwest where we found several listings for cut holiday trees in Arizona. Mast-Roth Farms looked promising. We found the store online and learned that the family behind Mast-Roth has proudly been bringing highest-quality Oregon Christmas Trees to the greater Phoenix area for over 30 years.  Well, so much for locally grown in Phoenix. But then again, where else are Oregon Christmas trees to go? We’re not expected to consume one third of the country’s cut holiday trees, are we?  Finally, we received a call from Alex Minchenkov, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. He confirmed that as of 2009 there were no cut Christmas tree farms in Wyoming or North Dakota. Utah was near the bottom of the list with two tree farm operations. The numbers, he acknowledged, may not include small-scale farmers.  Which brings us to our final point. Even though Merkley’s resolution highlights commercial Christmas tree farms, his statement honors the tree itself. And people in Alaska, Arizona and Nevada can always get a permit and cut their own tree from a forest.  Merkley spokesman Jamal Raad points out exactly that: The resolution says Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states, not that there are Christmas tree farms in all 50 states, which may or may not be true.  We could downgrade Merkley for his statement, because we’re not sure there are tree farms in all 50 states, and the resolution emphsizes commercial tree farms. But that would be so Grinch-like. Instead, we rule the statement True.

Tree lights were first mass-produced in 1890.From 1887 to 1933, a fishing schooner called the Christmas Ship would tie up at the Clark Street Bridge in Chicago and sell Michigan spruce trees to Chicagoans. The tradition of an official Chicago Christmas tree was initiated in 1913 when one was lit by Mayor Carter H. Harrison in Grant Park.More information is available on Extension's Christmas Trees and More website, urbanext.illinois.edu/trees/.Livestock owners are encouraged to prepare for Food and Drug Administration rule changes on antibiotics that will go into effect Jan. 1.Craig Payne, director of veterinary medical extension at the University of Missouri, said there are two main changes.The first deals with medically important feed-grade or water-soluble antibiotics that have a claim on the label, such as improved rate of weight gain or improved feed efficiency. These claims will be removed from the label, and the antibiotic will no longer be permissible to use for those production purposes.The FDA is eliminating production uses by making these label changes, Payne said. They want the antibiotics used just for treatment, prevention or control of disease.The second change deals with the same antibiotics, many of which have been available over the counter in the past. On Jan. 1, these antibiotics will require veterinarian oversight.For feed-grade antimicrobials, or agents that destroy microorganisms or hinder their growth, livestock owners will have to have a veterinary feed directive, or VFD. A veterinarian fills out the form, which is given to the feed distributor, who then issues the medicated feed. For water-soluble antimicrobials, a prescription from a vet will be required.The veterinarian-client-patient relationship is at the heart of all of this, Payne said. Veterinarians have issued prescription medications for years, and they need to have a VCPR in place to do this. A VCPR means the veterinarian must be acquainted with the care and keeping of the animals before they issue a VFD or prescription.A variety of species will be affected by the changes -- even insects such as bees.This goes for your backyard poultry flock or your kid's 4-H rabbit as well. It doesn't matter what species that the antibiotic is going to be used for, Payne said. It has a more widespread impact than your typical livestock such as cattle or hogs.The VFD also comes with an expiration date. Once that date hits, it is no longer appropriate to feed that medicated feed, despite how much is left over, but the veterinarian can issue another VFD, Payne said.",http://www.whig.com/20161225/christmas-trees-grown-in-all-50-states-and-canada,

NATIONAL RE-GIFTING DAY Each year on the Thursday before Christmas people across the United States celebrate National Re-gifting Day. This day was chosen in honor of office parties and the unique Christmas gift exchange that they do. This particular December Thursday appears to be the most common day for companies to hold their annual employee/company Christmas party. As a method of recycling, approximately 14%, of those surveyed, believe that re-gifting is becoming more popular, for that reason alone. OBSERVE While it may be an official holiday in some states, we suggest caution when deciding to re-gift something. The term does suggest, after all, that the item is unwanted to begin with and may be unwanted by its next recipient. Keep in mind the following re-gifting etiquette when considering participation in this holiday. o Re-gift only when certain the recipient will enjoy your (unwanted) gift. If at any time you referred to it as junk, clutter or dust collector, it’s probably not re-giftable. o The gift is brand new (aka unused!) and in its original packaging. No hand me downs! o Don’t hurt anyone’s feelings. If the gift had special meaning to the original giver, don’t re-gift. o Don’t re-gift if the item is handmade or personalized. If Uncle Joe spent his spare hours whittling that panic whistle, you should keep it. o Be careful not to re-gift something to the original giver. If you aren’t sure who gave it to you, don’t re-gift. o On that same note, to avoid embarrassment, re-gift only when you are sure the new recipient won’t tell the original giver what they received from you. (Is it starting to feel deceitful yet?) o Re-wrap all gifts and remove any tags that may suggest you didn’t do the shopping for the re-gifted item. o Be prepared to answer questions about the gift. Questions such as “Where did you find this? I’ve been looking everywhere for one!” may give up the secret if you aren’t able to give a convincing answer. (It should really start feeling deceitful, now.) If at any point you find the above list exhausting, then you probably should reconsider re-gifting. NAVY DAY Navy Day is observed annually on October 27. It is a day to salute all of the women and men who serve, or have served, in the United States Navy. The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is currently the largest, most powerful navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage.

The United States is the oldest democracy in the world.,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-us-oldest-democracy-world-he-righ/,True,Unrelated,Can not judge,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Which country can claim to be the World's oldest democracy? | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk,"YESTERYEARWhich country can claim to be the World's oldest democracy? Lots of them can. And do. Greece has a pretty good claim having invented the concept in the first place. However, long spells as an Ottoman colony or under military junta might put it out of the running if you're looking for longest continuously democratic country. Britain has a decent claim but it depends what you mean by democracy. As Rowan Atkinson put it in Blackadder: take Manchester for instance. Population: 60,000. Electoral roll: 3. America frequently claims to be but this is because they define democracy so narrowly and in their own image such that on their criteria they're the worlds only democracy and on any other criteria they still aren't and never have been. Perhaps Iceland can - their parliament, the Althing, is the oldest one still in use. It was formed in 930 by Vikings. The Native American people of the Six Nations, also known by the French term Iroquois and who know themselves as the Hau De-no Sau-nee (People of the Long Houses) claim to be the oldest living participatory democracy. Their homeland, country, nation or however you'd like to classify it as, was in the region now known as New York State, between the Adirondack Mountains and Niagara Falls. The other tribes included in the Six Nations also included the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas, joined in the 18th Century by the Tuscaroras, who did not have a vote. Archeological evidence indicates the Iroquois had lived on their lands for a very long time, with the earliest longhouses dated to at least 1100 A.D. Although there is no precise date for the establishment of the league, The Six Nations claim to have enjoyed a system of consensus government for over 800 years, well established long before the arrival of the Europeans. Founded to maintain peace and resolve disputes between its members, the Six Nations primary law was the Kainerekowa, the 'Great Law of Peace' which stated, simply, that Iroquois should not kill each other. They had a written constitution, laws dealing with ownership and trade routes and a funeral rite that allowed shared mourning at the passing of leaders from other tribes. From 1660, the nations combined to form a united front in negotiations with the European settlers. With the focus on maintaining peace with their neighbours, the Iroquois tribes were free to develop their predominantly agragian society. Their leaders were chosen, by their women, for their knowledge of the earth and their skills at providing for their villages. A great many can claim it. It rather depends what you mean by democracy. The Isle of Man has the oldest Parliament, but it has not always been elected by universal suffrage. Did the UK have to await the extension of the franchise to 18 year olds? Or was it 1929, when women got the vote on the same terms as men - at least for Parliament, only householders voted in local authority elections at the time? Switzerland has an ancient confederation, but governments never get voted out of power, due to the permanent coaltion. The same four parties have been in power since 1959, two of them for over a century. Switzerland, like California, makes great use of direct democracy, at both confederal and cantonal level. But in some cantons women didn't get the vote until the 1970s. Australia and New Zealand were both early to give women the vote, but neither elects their Head of State. If we mean by that, 'Which country has ensured that all adult citizens regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity, may choose reprentatives to exercise the powers of government longest?', then the answer is New Zealand. Universal adult suffrage was first established there in 1893. Seth, I'm surprised at you. Britain does not have a claim to being the world's oldest democracy, as it has only existed since, at the earliest, 1707. NZ wasn't the first to have universal suffrage. By 1893, universal suffrage had been established on the Isle of Man for 12 years (1881). Iceland is generally held to be the oldest Parliament, starting in 930. The oldest continuous Parliament is the Tynwald (Isle of Man), which started in 979, although its roots go further back. The Isle of Man has the oldest continuous parliament in the world. The Althing, the Icelandic parliament, is older, but it did not function for a number of years, so it is not the oldest continuous government. I'm biased, of course, but the United States has the oldest continuous democracy, dating back to 1776 when the 13 states declared independence and eventually gave the British a mighty whoopin'. Since then, for 231 years, every leader has been elected and there have been no kings, no queens, no military juntas, no conquerors and no dictatorships. End of discussion. I might be biased as well Bob from Michigan but you talk rubbish. Britain actually won more battles in the Revolution and when they faced just the US alone it was the US that got a 'whooping'. Your claim that that the US has the oldest democracy frankly does not hold any water as Britain goes back to 1707 so do your Maths. I would say the Isle of Man has a good claim, Don't know if England on it's own has a claim? Bob from Michigan I must comment on some of your statements : 1) The American Colonists hardly gave the British a “mighty whoopin”, but rather it was a joint effort, as are most things. Many countries directly or indirectly affected the outcome of the American Revolutionary War. Most of the gunpowder used by the Continental Army came from France. Direct French support starting in 1788 and before the wars end the Spanish and Dutch were fighting the British as well. Not directly in ally with the Americans, but the combined navy of these countries exceeded that of the British fleet and keep the British busy on many fronts. Catherine the Great of Russia created the League of Armed Neutrality which put further pressure on British resources and allowed supplies to reach the war engaged colonies. Meanwhile, the US Continental Army often took the stand of conducting a war of attrition rather than engagement in open decisive conflicts. Indeed, militarily speaking, Washington had only one real decisive military victory: at Yorktown. The rest were great public relations (e.g. his crossing of the Delaware), but of little military value. Yet the overall strategy won. Yorktown did not end the war, but it and the other ongoing pressures brought the British to the bargaining table. 2) The existing US government was not established in 1776, nor was it even the start of the Revolutionary war, which started in 1775. 1776 was just a year of declaring independence; it did not mean instant government formation. The Constitution, which forms the basis for the modern US government only came into effect, by its own self definition, in 1788 and the government it defined started operations on March 4, 1789, even though Rhode Island did not ratify the document until the next year. Thus we must decrease your accounting to 218 or 219 years of continue government depending on which date you select. 3) From 1861-1865 there were two governments that claimed sovereignty over 11 southern states, and those 11 states had no say in the federal election of 1864, nullifying their presidential democratic contribution in that election. After the Civil War the US congress considered the southern states as conquered provinces and set up marital law during post war reconstruction. Thus only a geographical part of the US can be said to have participated in a continual democracy, without military rule, since 1789. The ruling of Texas vs. White, in 1869, states the Supreme Court's position that the Union was indivisible and indissoluble matters little, as the above mentioned exclusion of democratic contributions can not be undone. Not to mention that the United States is not a democracy, but a republic. A minor point, but one that is constantly mistated. Marital law in the southern U.S.? Does that mean southern bachelors couldn't vote before 1861? Has no-one mentioned Iceland? Their parliament, the Althingi, was created in the early 11th century. In 1776, what percent of the world's nations had democratic systems of any kind and no royalty? Switzerland and Iceland qualify...what others were there? Eager for your answers. Having been assaulted by those who like to do as the neighbors do, rather than follow their own conscience, I think it is stunning that the USA didn't follow the crowd and become a kingdom but rather created their own unique democratic government. Everyone could have saved a lot of typing responding to Bob with these two words: Gerald Ford. He wasn't elected. He was appointed. Democracy is not my beloved birth-nation's strong suit. Our strength lies in finding just how far we can push the boundaries of Democracy. Turns out it's pretty stretchy. Funny that some claim America have the oldest democracy, even more so since up until the early 60's people of color and women were not eligible to vote Technically, black people could vote in 1870, with the ratification of the 15th amendment, and women could vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th amendment. It is true that black people were pretty much kept away from the polls until the 60s, but from a strictly historical standpoint they were given the right much earlier. And women could vote earlier than 1920 in some states. Philippe, you might want to check your facts on that one... Actually I have heard that Faeroe Islands has the oldest democracy. But they are still under the Danish, so I do not know how that would count and I do not know when they formed their parliament. Finland gave full rights to women to vote in 1906 and they were also good for being candidates in every elections on that date. That's earlier than anywhere else. That can be called oldest democracy by modern means. Remember, we had no slavery, nor was the right only in paper like for black Americans till 1960s. Oldest Democracy of the World- Malana Nalla, India Malana is a tribal village, which is considered as the oldest democracy in the world. The permission must be obtained by the head of the villagers to visit the important places in the village and one have to be very careful to not touch the untouched places (sacred places and monuments). In that case the villagers can claim the fine to the person who touched the places intentionally or not. If you use Universal Suffrage as your guide, the prize goes to New Zealand. The Faero Islands, Isle of Man and the various Native American democracies are automatically disqualified due to the fact that they're not actually independent countries. Iceland only regained its independence in 1944. Using the looser standard of a democratic or republican form of government regardless of the extent of the franchise, the world's oldest continuous Democracy is The Republic of San Marino, who repulsed their last would-be conqueror in 1739 (unless you count the retreating German Army and pursuing American Army in 1944, which amounted to no more than armed trespassing). The American states didn't win their independence until 1781, and the Swiss cantons had a wildly unpopular and less-than-democratic Helvetic Republic imposed upon them by the French Republican armies from 1798 to 1803. The USA cannot claim to have been a democracy prior to the abolition of slavery after the civil war. I'm sorry, the two just don't go hand in hand even if some states of the union had abolished slavery before the war. If Australia and New Zealand were early in giving the right to vote to women, but are not functioning democracies because they don't elect their heads of state, then that same situation exists for every member state of the British Commonwealth, including Britain, including the Isle of Man. Either the queens' representative or, in the case of Britain, the Queen is officially head of state and unelected (even if they are just figureheads these days...they cannot really exercise power over elected governments any more). This also applies to any other constitutional monarchies like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. Monarchs are heads of state but nevertheless unelected. The biggest black mark against Australian democracy has of course been the substandard treatment of Australia's indigenous peoples, also known as the Aboriginals. They were not even counted in the census or given the vote till 1967. The indigenous question remains Australia's greatest failing as a democratic state and it is an issue which cannot be ignored, much as we have swept it under the carpet in the past. Still all democracies have their bete noirs which they prefer to sweep under the carpet. Bete noirs must always be dealt with sooner or later of course. If we leave out the constitutional monarchy factor (probably sensible) then Australia and New Zealand at least gave universal franchise (not counting Aboriginals) before most other democracies. In Australia's case that goes back to well before the American Civil war years when the present day states of Australia considered themselves to be separate colonies of Britain, but had still extended the franchise as already outlined. After the states federated in 1901 then that franchise became national... but it had certainly existed long before the existence of the Commonwealth of Australia. Over the last 30 or so years the word Commonwealth has been unofficially dropped and Australia is just called Australia these days. There have been no interruptions to the continuity or stability of democracy in either Australia or New Zealand since their inception, making them amongst the world's oldest functioning stable democracies, or at least they are considered to be such. After reading all the competition entries, I declare the winner of the oldest democracy to be...Iceland. (Isle of Man had to be eliminated on a technicality; it's not strictly a country as specified in the original question.) I recognise my decision will lead to considerable re-printing expenses in the United States at a time of great financial duress. I'm really sorry. The Faroese have Løgtingið, which is the oldest parliament in the world! Respecting the fact, that the Faroes were explored earlier than Iceland and had the same Norse rules, there is not much doubt, that the Faroese ting is older than that of Iceland, which was founded in 930. Scott, the Isle of Man is an independent nation, often wrongly considered part of the UK. It is not and never has been. It has a very good claim to being the world's oldest democracy, with the oldest continuously existing parliament in the world dating from AD 979. A good contender for the earliest parliament, though not necessarily by universal suffrage, was the Tinganes established by the Vikings in the Faero Islands of the north Atlantic which can be dated back to 825AD. Can a country be really considered to be democratic until every citizen, male or female, black or white were given the vote? I know women here in New Zealand were given the vote in 1893 but not sure if that was the first. Canada has been a continuous democracy since 1867. Having a parliament does not alone make you a democratic institution. Iceland had a king. I think most reasonable people would say if you have a king you can't truly be a democratic institution as most Americans think. They didn't even get true independence from Denmark until 1918. It is LAUGHABLE to think a country is a democracy if it is in FACT controlled by some other country?! That said, if not all citizens are allowed to vote I think the same can be said. Blacks didn't get the right to vote until about 100 years ago, women didn't get the right to vote until 80 years ago. That is a much stronger argument for why America is not the oldest democracy. Besides, technically the US is classified as a Republic, as is most other democracies. Nobody on this topic will ever agree because everyone on this topic has a different definition of what a democracy is. I would define a democracy as ALL citizens get to vote for EVERY leadership position including the top position. Democracy is a Greek Word. Socrates drank hemlock 400 years before Jesus rather than live elsewhere, and it was a Jury of his Peers that condemned him to death. What, in fact, caused his death was his rejion of his own democratic leadership. I suspect the oldest democracy may be San Marino. Whilst its constitution was recorded in 1600, the form of government had been established since 301. This predates all the claims, except possibly Mullana (which did not have a date associated). The December 2009 issue of National Geographic Magazine has this quote at p.141: ...the Holy Community - the world's longest continually functioning parliament -... This in reference to the self-governing peninsula of Mount Athos, off northern Greece. It has been occupied by a community of Christian monks, who eventually built their first large monastery in 963. You forget one thing all the time: it isn't enough that you have the right to vote - you must also have the right to be a CANDIDATE! These are two different things. Women were allowed to vote in New Zealand in 1893 but they were not eligible until 1919. Also, Icelandic parliament didn't have a real universal suffrage until the 20th century. Finland was the first state to give women the right to be a candidate in 1906 and Finland had the first female members of parliament in the world in 1907. Therefore, Finland was the first country with true universal democracy. Also all the minorities and the landless people had the same rights. At that time Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire and got full independence later, in 1917. In essence, Finland was a monarchy with its own parliament but the Russian tsar as the head of the state. I think you can't call a country democratic if it excludes women, minorities or poor people from elections/eligibility. That is what has happened everywhere in the world until the 20th century. Finland was the first to have universal rights. Switzerland is the only true Democracy. Only the citizens or this country can make laws, or resend them. They have had this current Switzerland is the only true Democracy. Only the citizens or this country can make laws, or resend them. They have had this current government since 1322, when they wrote the Arch Bishop of Austria and declared their independence. The have had the same government rules since then, all changes have to be approved by the citizens of this country. There was never a round fired in their succession from the Austrian Empire. The politicians only rule over parliamentary procedure, as in Roberts rule of order. All the above who are stating that everyone in the country needs to vote to be considered a democracy is utterly wrong, you are thinking of a REPUBLIC in which the rights of the individual are supreme. Unfortunately in democracy it is the GROUP elected which has the power, nothing to do with any individuals or who voted for said individuals. Isle of Man is in fact part of the British Empire, as a dependent country(if you don't realize Queen Elizabeth II is the RULER of the Isle of Mann you are an idiot). Iceland is out because it was under Danish rule until mid 1900's. USA would rule supreme as over 230 years old. My immediate answer would have to be Greece, since Socrates actually coined the word, but they certainly don't have the longest running one unless we want to ignore that whole junta thing that went on back in the early 70s. Malana would have to be eliminated since it is a tribal village owing allegiance to India. Also, in Malana, anyone who is not from Malana is untouchable. This would probably indicate that they cannot vote. So, what's the definition of a Democracy? I would put it like this: Any type of government in which the powers exercised as representative of the people are exercised by officials elected by the citizens. This would eliminate the judiciary branch in most systems since their powers are interpretive, not representative. Using the US as an example, then, officials in the executive and legislative branches are elected by the citizens. Following that train of thought would seem to indicate that representative forms of government which exclude citizens from voting (eg. women's suffrage) would not qualify for the longest-running Democracy. Therefore, I'd have to nominate New Zealand which gave universal suffrage in 1893, pre-dating Finland by about 15 years and the US by about 30. People seem to think that just because you have royalty you cannot have parliament. After the British Civil War the royalty never had the same power it used to and even though there is/was a monarch in place it does not mean that you cannot also have a democratic parliament. Once again, Americans getting the facts wrong. Most of what they have in place is based on parts of what other countries had in place. This is not to say that the end product was not different (and very good). Athens was never a democracy, the greater part of the population, women and slaves, had no vote. Greece has even less claim. It was also part of the Ottoman Empire and post World War II it was a military dictatorship. The Faroe Islands have the oldest parliament in the world, founded in the year 850 or 900 by the Vikings (The Løgting). I just want to clear something up about monarchy. There is a difference between absolute monarchy and constitutional monarchy. An absolute monarchy rules absolutely and undemocratically without recourse to parliament. A constitutional monarchy on the other hand is merely a ceremonial, figurehead. Executive power r rests in the hands of the prime minister and the cabinet. All monarchies in Western Europe and Japan are of this sort and completely demotic. Now, not all rebuilds are democracies. There are many republics around the world which are not democratic and where the individual does not rule supreme. Republics as and of themselves are not necessarily democratic. Just as monarchies are not all undemocratic. Most are democratic n the modern World. The final thing I want to say is that most democracies prior to the late 19th Century were partial or limited democracies only, such as Great Britain and the USA. Both of these countries were slave owning societies to one extent or the other. Slavery was abolished in d the UK in 1807 and in the British colonies as a whole in 1834. America did not finally abolish slavery until 1865 and black men and Native American men the vote until 1870. Both the USA and the UK compete for the claim of first democracy status but I mean, its a funny kind of democracy that is also slave owning society. Well there are many arguments which have merit here. In the UK you are not a citizen but a subject, property of the Crown (as is most land), to be disposed of as the Crown sees fit. You may have the right to vote but this is relatively new in that at one time you had to pay for that right and the price was set high so that most commoners could not afford to participate. The Iroquois Confederacy was like most North American societies prior to the annexation or conquest by Europeans, matriarchies. As for the Norse lands, they were slave owning societies so were not fully enfranchised . So we have the odd one out... the Isle of Man... always independent of the British Crown even though in the British seas. Clearly the only true democracy is Saudi Arabia. In the UK we no longer think of ourselves as subjects of the Crown but citizens. In the British passport it clearly states that we are British Citizens not subjects of the Crown. This has been the case for many decades and anyway was only ever nominal, unless you go right back to Early Modern times. We are citizens with rights enshrined in law that goes back to the Middle Ages, e.g. the Act of Habeas Corpus. To say that UK citizens are the property of the Crown is ludicrous and naive. It is not true that people have had to pay to vote, at least not in the Modern Era. However, there were property qualifications that excluded a large section of society from the franchise. These property qualifications were abolished in the Mid-Nineteenth century. Property qualifications were also abolished in the US at a similar time but Native Americans did not get the vote until as late as 1924. In response to Martins peculiar view of British land ownership and property rights, in fact most land is held in freehold by individuals or corporations, as in the U.S. Crown Land is in actuality held and administered by the Government. It is Crown Land in name only. The Monarch herself owns some private land. I have heard some drivel in my time but this is ridiculous. The Isle of Man has the OLDEST CONTINUOUS PARLIaMENT in the world, Tynwald. This is a parliament that has been renewed every time by the Lord of Man; the Lord of Man may change but the parliament stays the same. For any Americans that's like when you get a new president. As for Iceland it was not functioning for several years making it restart from after the period of outage in the 1800s. The king or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland happens to be the Current Lord of Man. The Island is an independent nation with its own currency and language. Australia still has a monarch; does that make it part of the British Empire, answer to some retarded ill thought comments. What's really funny is that the question posed was 'Which country can claim to be the World's oldest democracy?' No mention of continuous or interruption, just oldest. We can take from that many ideas, some examples being the time it was started (Greeks) the total of years operating as a democracy (don't know) or the type, total democracy (Switzerland) or limited democracy (Russia) so I would say the question is still un-answered. One point for the Isle of Man people, parliament does not mean democracy. For everyone else democracy is a system whereby everyone has equal access to power and to make decisions about the future of oneself and the place they live in. My money is on Switzerland, where this has been possible for everyone for quite some time. Sorry, Joe.... although the US was established as a Republic, where the States Independence had precedence over any Federal laws, the Republic has been turned into a Top-Down democracy where even our inalienable rights no longer take precedence. The problem became even more compounded and utterly ironic when Republicans like Ronald Reagan started forcing laws like 21-year-old drinking age on the States by withholding Federal Interstate Highway funds about 25 years ago. Now they do it any time they don't like a State Law and can't get it labeled Unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The US is no longer a Republic... not by a long shot! I would not go as far as to say that Sven is talking complete drivel but the idea of the Isle of Man as the Worlds oldest democracy is questionable. For two reasons: 1. Until the 19th Century, the Isle of Man was a man only democracy (It seems that the Isle of Man was just about as slow as anyone else as giving the whole population the vote. ) and 2. The island is not a sovereign country, it is a dependent territory. It is part of the United Kingdom. For me a true democracy has to enfranchise women. My money is on New Zealand, which gave women the vote in 1893. I am not claiming that Prophet Mohammed was the first to create a consultancy government. However Koran did insist that Islamic ruling should depend on consultancy between all heads of tribes. Unfortunately this has since changed and those claim to be an Islamic countries do not apply Islamic values. I don't think the United States is or ever has been a democracy. Unless you're filthy rich you can not be a candidate! The United States can't even be called a democracy because if it were Al Gore would have been president for winning the popular vote. I just heard President Obama address the Indian Parliament. He said Greetings to the World's largest democracy from the World's oldest democracy. I guess that settles it. Unless, of course, you think Mr. Obama is full of excrement. How Barack Obama can claim that America is the world's oldest democracy is beyond me. Only ten years ago George Bush was voted into power on a minority vote. Al Gore achieved more votes than George Bush in the 2000 election. Indeed in the state of Florida spoiled votes were not recounted and in the end George Bush was voted into power by the courts rather than the people, and that only happened because the republican judges, who were in the majority in that court, voted in a party partial way. That my friends in America is not democracy so stop telling the world that you are the world's oldest democracy. Les Rutledge In listening to President Obama speak in the Indian Parliament, it was interesting when he said India was the largest Democracy in the world, there was thunderous applause in the chamber; however, in the next breath, when he stated the US is the oldest Democracy in the world, there was deafening silence. Sometimes, silence speaks louder than words. All I would say is this type of comment makes as much sense to me as saying President Obama is the 'leader of the free world.' I would venture to guess, there would be less than 100% agreement on that particular statement, as well. A proud Canadian There never has been - and probably never will be - any true 'democracy' in the strictest sense of the word. That said, the word 'democracy' is usually only ever used to represent a constitutional republic (as opposed to a monarchy or some other form of governance). So, the question is actually what is the oldest nation to have always had a constitution and democratically-elected officials. As much as I like Barack Obama, I was appalled to hear him say in a speech to the Indian parliament that the USA was the world's oldest democracy. His speechwriters have gotten this one wrong. It is typical of the attitude that the USA is the best country in the World' statement I hear over and over again....or America is a shining beacon to the rest of the world. Yes, the US has the world's largest economy, and perhaps the World's most powerful military (let's hope we never have to find out), but Americans have heard this mantra since birth and most of them believe it. That's why there's so much anger in the US electorate. They're hurting economically, the standard of living is going down, and someone has to be blamed. Wake up--You are at fault. Other countries have good ideas. Just because it's not the way you do things doesn't mean universal health care is communist, or a better safety net is socialist. You don't have the oldest democracy. Blacks were slaves for much of your history and their vote was actively repressed until the 60's and more subtly repressed in Florida for the election of the disaster of Bush's. Unless you admit to yourselves that you are not the ultimate in all things you will never be able to compete in this changing world, secure in the knowledge that you are the best. Vaishali or Vesali (Pali) or Vaishali republic,the capital city of the Licchavi in eastern Indian province of bihar has the rare distinction of being the seat of first democratic government of the world as early as in the 6th century bc B.C its adjecent city patliputra,present day patna was the world's largest city, with a population of 150,000-300,000. visit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishali_%28ancient_city%29 I have to agree with the guy from South Africa. When they break up the two party dictatorship that rules the United States and actually let people have more options, then we can finally become a democracy. Right now our whole election system is a sham. The best part - votes by the people in the U.S.A really do not matter. What matters is how the electoral college votes. If they so choose they could elect the loser to be president even though they promised to vote for a certain candidate. In other words, in November the people may have elected one candidate, the electoral college may choose to elect another. And the electoral college's choice will be the next president. Wish they would have done that back in 2000 and overrode Bush's win, We could have avoided a costly war in Iraq. I am sure the first and longest running democracy has to be the city of Athens. Democracy and Republic are very specific. A democracy is a government in which the power is vested in ALL the people. Athens randomly voted people to run the city every 4 years. That means ANYONE could have been voted to run the government. What I finhlrious though more then anything is after 234 years it's amazing how pissy the Brits still are about losing the American Revolution. We did beat you in several major and important battles before the French would even touch the US. One of the angry UKer's oh wait, I mean English responders since you certainly aren't a kingdom anymore should re-read your history books if you think Washington's only victory was Yorktown. It was the combination of victories at Trenton, Saratoga, and Nathanael Greene's victories in the south that beat the British. The French only started supplying the US after we walloped you at Saratoga. The British officers were too busy trying to screw their subordinates wives then fight. The French did help immensely but to act like the US wasn't giving you guys a good fight makes you sound like a bunch of angry idiotic school children. It's pathetic. The US isn't perfect by any means but beating the biggest superpower of that time and maintaining the same government for 234 years is not a bad stretch. Also the help America gave you and Europe in WWII is so quickly forgotten, I just don't get it where all the bitterness comes from but that's a whole other story. Bitter, bitter, bitter. The claim that many people are making about the United States not being a democracy at all is absurd, come live here and you'll see that it's much nicer from the inside than it is from the outside. I live in a city of about 600,000 people and I personally know two members of city council (one of them is my History teacher's brother), have met both of our senators and live blocks away from the ex-governor. None of these people are rich tycoons, none of these people are in any way evil; they all work towards serving freedom and serving the ideals that the United States have put forward as a democracy. I think that when a 14 year old kid can have all these connections to his government and his politics, democracy is working pretty damn well! -Griffin Oh Dave, you say it's hilarious how pissy Brits get when it is suggested that the US did at all well in their revolution, and then you go on to puff and preen about what a big achievement it really was, and can't everyone acknowledge how well you all did against such a big mean super power. I can only imagine how much in awe of Afghanistan you must be, as they've pretty much fought off TWO superpowers (USSR & USA), and managed both within the past half century rather than more than two and a half centuries ago... And, indeed, that they managed it without having many of the decisive battles lead by a foreign general, with half foreign troops, and their enemy cut off from resupply by a foreign naval blockade, and distracted by other wars elsewhere in the world. Now that is a REAL achievement. But the USA did pretty well too, so good on you. I'll put a lovely ribbon in the mail for you. Oh, and thanks for saving everyone in world war two. I'm not sure why Americans always want thanking for this, but it was very nice of you to only sit and watch fascism spread over the world for three years before jumping in. I have every confidence that without your involvement Hitler would have won, and then would have stopped, and in no way tried to attack the USA form a position of strength. He was a very good little boy about that sort of thing. So cheers for being a pal there. It was Lichhavi Dystany which was existing 400 to 750 years before Budha and Wikipedia says:Licchavi (also Lichchhavi, Lichavi) was an ancient kingdom in Nepal, which existed in the Kathmandu Valley from approximately 400 to 750. Centuries earlier, at the start of the Buddhist era a powerful republic known as Licchavi existed in what is today Bihar. There is no conclusive evidence of any ethnic or historic links between the two states. The language of Licchavi inscriptions is Sanskrit, and the particular script used is closely related to official Gupta scripts, suggesting that India was a significant cultural influence. This was likely through Mithila - the northern part of modern Bihar, India. The term 'Licchavi' term probably derives from Rikshavi possibly Sanskritized to Rkshvavati. Riksha or Rksha in Sanskrit means Star. A table of the evolution of certain Gupta characters used in Licchavi inscriptions prepared by Gautamavajra Vajrācārya can be found online. In that period there is no official record about US,UK or any other Western civilization. Well what about the 5000 year old government of Ancient Egypt??? I think Dave Piccolo from CT is paranoid. We Brits do not exactly spend much of our time thinking about the American Revolution and there cant be many of us who are still sore about losing a war that took place over two hundred years ago. For most British people the American Revolution wouldnt even be on their radar but, obviously Dave in his vivid imagination envisions a British nation still seething at the loss of its American Colonies. Doubtless, to Americans the revolution is still important but to us British its a side issue to the main story of European history. Im a history graduate and on our course we did not even touch on American history. All utterly wrong. One of the first and obviously the longest lasting democratic government of any breed existed in San Marino circa 301 AD. Now the fun part. 1. Britain endured an oligarchic parliamentary government for most of it's democratic history. No modern democracy existed until 1918 in the Representation of the People Act in 1918, women only found themselves represented in reality in 1928 and the current equal suffrage at 18 system did not appear until 1969. Britain's Parliamentary phase preceded America's existence as an entity, but it would also be classified as an indirect democracy. While parliamentary sovereignty was a major facet of the political sphere one also cannot deny early royal influence. 2. Iceland, respectably well-aged in it's practices endured a Tribal Council; holding some benefits but hardly enjoying anything resembling a real democracy. As an elite council however it had an early life, but was stifled for years by Monarchical rule. There was no clear line from 930 to today of anything consistent. 3. America, founded in 1776 held a base and rudimentary form of democracy. Only in the Jackson era and early 20th century reform era was the franchise actually expanded, but the nation still existed as a democratic entity with all organs of government stemming from a free electorate, well maintained by an active press and civil society. 4. The Isle of Man enjoyed an old Parliamentary system but is a dependency of the British Crown. The Queen has little influence on theirs or English affair, but since the Manx do not participate in English governance they lack total dominion over their own affairs. 5. The People of the Longhouse; there's an interesting situation. Councils of Female Elders did at a point select male leaders in one portion of their history. However applying logic used against western democracies that refused suffrage to women, men had little say in governance at this point. After a brief spell in this period the reverse arose with militaristic warriors and warlords seizing the reins of governance with no representation or accountability whatsoever. The massive portion of the population that was assimilated and forced to live among them also lacked representation. 6. Switzerland holds a respected but unbreakable coalition government and representation for women occurred startlingly late in its history. 7. India, no. Simply no. Arguments that it is the world's oldest, or longest reigning democracy are founded upon the most biased, ignorant and nationalistic stance. India hardly even existed throughout history and when it did it endured authoritarian empires. 8. In 1775 we saw the birth of the Corsican republic, pre-dating the United States. Democratic institutions were later crushed by French forces, but there are arguments to be made. Nowadays it participates in French governance and therefore is represented in all facets of it's affairs, if not as an independent entity. Griffin, as an English ex-patriot living for the past twelve years in the USA, I can assure you that the reality is far uglier than the glossy image. A democracy perhaps, but a very, very poor one. The entire electoral and administrative system is controlled either indirectly or, increasingly, directly by large corporations. To get an agreeable answer you should find a common definition for democracy first. But keep on posting, it's quite entertaining. Catalonia, now an autonomous region of Spain, has one of the oldest democratic parliaments in the world and the oldest that has lasted until today. Parliament was born 1283 and its first president was named the 1359. Despite its suppression during times of absolute monarchy and dictatorship, the Parliament continues today, having passed and 129 presidents. The U.S. is one of, if not the oldest government in continuous existence. Other contenders that I have heard make this claim or have had this claim made on their behalf include Australia, Canada, Catalonia, Iceland, Isle of Man, New Zealand, San Marino, and UK. The Commonwealth of Australia was formed on January 1, 1901 when the six Australian colonies formed a single federation. Canada celebrates its independence in 1867 when four of the provinces came together to form a union. Catalonia is an autonomous region within Spain, but still subject to Spanish authority. Iceland was actually under the rule of Denmark until 1918, and under German rule during WWII. Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency. It is not a country. New Zealand became self-governing in 1852, after having been a colony of the British Empire. While it had the same constitution in continuous existence from 1600, San Marino was under the control of the Fascist Party from 1923 to 1943. The current democratic system of government in the UK began with the Reform Bill of 1832. On July 4, 1776, the American colonies issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their right to self-determination and their establishment of a cooperative union. They defeated the British Empire in the American Revolution, the first successful colonial war of independence, and the current United States Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic. It is also the oldest democracy in continuous existence. While some have questioned whether or not it is a true democracy, and whether it could be considered a democracy when it allowed slavery and women did not have the vote, no democracy is a true democracy. Most of the countries we call democracies are actually republican democracies, in which the electorate elect representatives to represent them in carrying out the responsibilities of government. They retain control, however, through a combination of periodic elections, term limits, and the right to recall. And no nation has universal suffrage. Most nations allowed slavery into the 1800s, many still tolerate it today, and many even allow certain forms of it legally. Most nations did not allow women to vote until the Twentieth Century. Almost none allow children, felons, the mentally incompetent, and non-citizens to vote. The US is the oldest. Well I do not perceive UK as a democratic country because queen still has got the legal right to sign the prime minister and lead the army !! seriously 9 out of 10 human being out there in the world have no idea where the hell is Isle of the man!!?? San Marino is the oldest republic in the world and their constitution was written in 3rd century. It has also never been conquered so I think it is the oldest democracy. The first problem in this debate is that no uniform definition of a Democracy exists. However, numerous historical examples exist which reflect aspects of modern democratic governments, including ancient Athens, Iceland, the Iroquois, and so forth. In many cases these models emerge as these societies evolved from tribal governments, and those that survived often did so because they were sufficiently isolated from the political currents that led to increasingly large and powerful nation-states headed by absolute monarchs backed by aristocracies and clergy. No rule is absolute, but this does tend to hold up in most cases. Britain began evolving toward what we might call democracy during the early modern era, and many of those developments were paralleled in their young colonies in the Americas. Although America did manage to break from Britain both nations continued to develop stronger democratic traditions in spite of their differing labels (Constitution or Monarchy aside). Both nations gradually enfranchised more and more voters right through to the twentieth century. It can be said that modern Democracy developed in the English speaking world, but not in just one nation. America and Britain certainly share kudos for the fact though. The US is not a Democracy! It is an Aristocratic Oligarchy. The text book definition of democracy varies from text to text. de·moc·ra·cy- government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. (dictionary.com) the concept of democracy is implausible, as there always has been and always will be those who take advantage, lie, and cheat. a classic example would be the Watergate scandal during the Reagan era http://www.watergate.info/ another great example is the assassination of Julius Caesar http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/caesar.html and my final example is in reference to Adolf Hitler http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0403a.asp and his rise to power over the German people. The US is *not* a democracy at all, it is a republic and anyone who buys into the Orwellian hogwash, whether they be a US citizen or not, quickly appear to be ignorant of the US's true governmental structure. I am shocked to see how many take jabs at the US for no apparent reason. The more I see these nasty, misguided, and wholly ignorant anti-US comments, the more I think you people are just projecting a vague dislike onto us. Very juvenile. The issue of democracy is not as clear as everyone states. We in America get to chose our leaders based on a small selection of rich politicians who have basically bought their right to run for president. The whole system is corrupt and has been since God told us that we would be under oppression with a King( or universal governing body). There is only one King and he is the King of all Nations. We would be best served to take the advise of the Bible, take care of yourself, your neighbors, love your God, and mind your own business. Everything else causes strife in the world. End of story. Some might say Australia is still on a path to independence as we are still technically ruled by the British monarchy, even though that monarchy does not have any right to interfere with Australian laws. @Bob.....America was founded as a Constitutional REPUBLIC, not a democracy! You have done NO research at all it seems !!! Canada is the oldest continuous democratic federation in the world. Whether its Iceland or Finland the most important mark of the longest democracy is 'That every citizen can vote and apply as a candidate for any position, prime minister or president. This precludes all constitutional monarchies as candidates for the world's longest democracies. The Tynwald on the Isle of Man has been in existence since 979 and is still going strong. Patriarchate of Aquileia in Friuli (italy) had a parliament since 1231, and lasted since the arrival of Napoleon (1805). The participants of the session were nobles, clergy and even the representations of the municipalities. In addition there was an organism called Contadinanza (literally Farmance) that represented the farmers of Friuli To answer the question, you first have to define what you mean by democracy. I'd suggest it means that those who exercise real legislative or executive power are elected by, and accountable to, the general citizenry. Having a figurehead head of state (whether hereditary or appointed) does not matter if they exercise no real power. If you accept that democracy means polticl ffices with real power are elected and accountable, then the following candidates advocated by other contributors are definitely out of the running for the oldest democracy: - UK: One legislative chamber is, to this day, not elected. The House of Lords consists mainly of people appointed for life, with some hereditary peers. Although the Lords is not as powerful as the Commons, it does still exercise legislative power. So scratch the UK. - Canada: One legislative chamber is appointed, not elected. The Canadian Senate exercises actual legislative power but is not elected by, or directly accountable to, the citizenry. - US: Until the 17th amendment took effect in 1913, the US Constitution provided that US senators were appointed by State legislatures, not directly elected by voters. As Senators serve six year terms, it wasn't until January 1919 that citizen-elected Senators completely replaced State-appointed Senators. And as late as 1860, at least one State (South Carolina) did not give its citizens any direct say in the election of the US President; the State's legislature appointed members of the State's electoral college to cast the State's votes for the presidency. In contrast, many comparable large democracies have directly elected all political office-holders since the establishment of their current constitutions. Examples include India, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, France and Germany. Of these, I think only Australia (1901) and New Zealand (1906) (and possibly France) have had completely democratic (i.e. fully elected) governance longer than the US. Some Australian States had direct election by citizens of all political office-holders even earlier; for example Victoria from 1856. But none of these come close to the Isle of Man or Iceland, which seem to get the prize. The United States is neither a true democracy or a true republic. The electorial college, for which I see no reason, has the power to elect the president over the majority vote of the people. Which they have done. Big corporations and government entities such as DOE and TVA have no accountability. The EPA supposedly oversees that the environment is not overly harmed but they are also a government entity. Big money wins over environmentalism. The US does not provide health care or secondary education to its citizens. While claiming equality, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Presidential candidates are always very wealthy. The US also likes to ignore the fact that it was founded on the genocide and annihilation of one race ( The Native Americans )and the enslavement of another (Africans). Earth to Tony Mann, you stated I'm a history graduate and on our course we did not touch on American History. What a simple course. You do not qualify as a WORLD history graduate, I'm so sorry old chap. I almost gave in to the temptation to be a smartass 'who cares...all that matters is who is standing in the end' kind of thing. But it is really intriguing when you think that after all this time we still do not have a clear determination of what constitutes a democracy. The early African Kingdoms date 500 B.C before the writings of the classical Greek scholar Herodotus. The Akamba tribe of East Africa were organised into many clans for the purpose of governing. Their governmental system was very strong because elders were elected to the office of leadership by the virtue of their character,integrity and honesty. Their government is best described as government by agreement. They had no written language and had no books to keep their records, except by the word of mouth. Akamba established rules and regulations to run their daily tribal affairs. In time of war against other tribes they elected a war chief-----a man of physical discipline, outstanding oratorical ability and one who was willing to be accepted as a war chief. The elders were also the judges of the tribe, and their government was ruled by a consensus. No elder or any other speaker was allowed to speak or address the council with a forceful tone of anger that would only weaken his point. I saw a lot of letters from American preening and being..well loud mouthed americans about their 'whooping' Britain. All I can say is that the British treated the people in their colonies and in their own country with equality. The British were certainly far more cultured, advanced in treating people from other cultures and race than the Americans. Blacks in USA led a nightmarish life well upto the middle of the 20th Century. As for the Red Indians whose land was looted with impunity, the less said the better for American 'democracy'. While the Isle of Man certainly has the oldest continuous parliament in the world, nobody can really claim that it was democratic for most of its history. Until the 19th century its members were appointed. The longevity of Tynwald is a red herring in this debate. The island's real claim to being the oldest democracy comes from giving women the vote earlier than any other country. Manxmen AND WOMEN had the vote from 1881, well ahead of the United Kingdom, United States and two years before New Zealand. On the basis that a country that denies the right to vote to citizens/subjects on grounds of gender or race is not really a democracy, the Isle of Man (and Woman) wins. Forgot to say: prisoners also get the vote in the Isle of Man, unlike those in the United Kingdom. How is that for democracy and human rights, Guardian fans? So sorry to have offended William from Niagara Falls, NY, but my postings were in response to the arrogant posting of Bob from Michigan. Its been some months since I posted those messages and I am not as angry as I was. Some of what I wrote was not my considered opinion. Again, apologies old chap (Not that old chap is a phrase I would normally use.) All this wind overlooks the many limitations on the franchise in the U.S. In some places, you'll need a prescribed photo of yourself in order to vote this year. In others, a picture of Benjamin Franklin on a $100 bill is just as good. In most places, a convicted felon is not allowed to vote, and nearly everywhere we allow or even encourage absolute idiots to exercise the franchise. It appears that there is no correct way to define a democracy. According to what I have read above. No matter. The U.S. is a Republic, pure and simple. I hope it stays that way. The people in power would like to think it was a democracy. Why? I don't know. We do not have a majority vote in elections, and read section 14, article 14 of the constitution. AND-- I haven't heard anyone pledge allegiance to the flag , and to the democracy it stands for. And I never sang the Battle Hymn of the democracy. I fought for my Republic in World War 2 and I hope it stays that way. Have a good day. Jeremy, you are 100% wrong on pretty much everything. The Crusades were quite successful in stopping the advance of the Muslim hordes and even managed to hold the fort in the middle of enemy territory for quite a long time, without supplies or reinforcements. The Muslims were always and still are criminal barbarians who never achieved anything themselves. All the alleged thinkers of Islam are either Jewish, European, Persian, Indian or Berber and only just after Islam was imposed on them, i.e. while they still were connected with their former, non-Muslim culture. As soon as they had been living under Islam for 2 or 3 generations, all intelligence, innovation and decency was driven out. When people claim that Muslims were allegedly in advance, Europe build gigantic cathedrals that took centuries to build, yet that were completely planned out from the beginning. e.g. the Cathedral of Lausanne was built starting in the 11th century. Musulims never built anything even remotely comparable. All the wealth of Islam was due to THEFT. They created nothing. Pesants and workers were looked down on by Mohammed, who was a trader himself and who knew nothing else. He never even stopped to think about the fact that any good he traded had to be created first. The decline of the Musllim power had to come as an absolute necessity as soon as they could not win any further battles. With the exception of women's suffrage, the USA is, without question, the oldest continual sovereign democratic republic on earth, dating to the ratification and enactment of the current US constitution in 1789. With the exception of womens suffrage, the suffrage of indigenous people and the suffrage of black people, the USA would have been the oldest continual sovereign democratic republic on earth, if it were not for the fact that until 1865, the USA was also a slave-owning society. Slave-owning is just about as profoundly UN-democratic as it gets. Modern, democratic America began in 1865; at least thats my opinion Oldest democracy ? An interesting question but not really of much moment. A better question is : what country currently has the best values and ideals and endeavors to live by the simple creed espoused by Google: Do no harm. By this I mean that the government of the candidate country should care for ALL its citizens (using some meaningful definition of equality........there are many definitions ) and, just as importantly, should do no harm to the citizens of other countries. Obviously some countries geopolitical stature is very prominent and they stride the world stage in a loud manner. Metaphorically , if we liken the world to the proverbial school yard and the world's countries to kids on the school yard, then who are the well behaved kids? Who are the school bullies? Who are the prefects ? Who is the Dux of the school? In an imperfect world these are important questions for all of us. Which country is an exemplar of good behavior ? Er, the American Revolution wasn't called that at the start. Thomas Jefferson himself referred to it as a Civil War, and considered himself a British Citizen, part of the group of British Americans going to war with their British cousins over a lack of political representation (fair enough, can't blame them for wanting to be part of a Democracy) If it had been the native American Indians trying to kick out the Colonial Oppressors we could talk about giving them a whooping, but actually it was British Citizens fighting British Citizens... with help on both sides from mercenaries. Anyway, despite the Second Civil War in the 1860s, the ex-slaves didn't get to vote or be treated as full citizens until the 1960s, so the US can't be the oldest Democracy. The UK is not even now a full Democracy because of the unelected House of Lords (though the system works well despite that). Can any Country accepting laws written by unelected EU Officials currently be considered truly Democratic? I have lived in the US, UK and EU, and enjoyed and respected all. However, the country in which I now live, Switzerland, feels more Democratic than any of them, and the people trust themselves to make decisions by voting, rather than voting every few years to elect someone to take decisions for them. Yes women only got the vote in the last of 26 Cantons in the 1970s, but before that it was considered that men voted on behalf of their family's views, including their children's, not their personal views. Not ideal of course, but who is to say that the current cutoff at 18 in most countries is correct? They also make sure their children are educated well enough to make an informed voting decision, and to take their responsibility seriously, unlike in some other countries. The Swiss also allow non-citizens to vote in local elections after five years residence (unlike the Ancient Greeks and Romans...). Democracy isn't the perfect system, but it's the least bad one we have, rather like Capitalism... In the school yard of the world, the USA has been the teacher, keeping the peace on the playground from the bullies. Are we the best behaved and the best liked? No. Teachers have to maintain order and exact penalties of one kind or another. Who likes that? Who cares when it's power and respect that's required, not niceness. The Greeks had slaves, ergo no democracy. The Haudenosaunee (iroquois) women participated in the only true democracy on the planet hundreds of years before any other people considered women more than chattel. Ladies of the court were made available to the king in England. The Matriarchal system of the Haudenosaunee so scared the church and state that they rounded up aboriginal children and slaughtered them in residential schools up until the 70's in Canada. Generally speaking i would say the USA for the simple reason that in 1920 all citizens (including women) could vote where as the same only applies to Britain after 1928, so my personal view is that the USA is the worlds first modern democracy I have read many of the entries above and can not believe that anybody can even consider a country democratic without universal suffrage - isn't that the point of democracy? So the US is OUT! The US did not give women the vote until 1920 and Native Americans were not given citizenship until 1924. Australia is really out as they did not give the vote to Aborigines till 1967 - so Australia is a pretty new democracy. Somebody even entered Switzerland (!) but they have only been democratic for 41 years having only granted women suffrage in 1971. I believe that New Zealand is the longest standing democracy, having granted women the vote in 1893. However, I take the point that some people have made that a parliamentary constitutional monarchy is not a true democracy. However, if one goes by the Polity IV scale, the wildly used to measure democracy, or the Democracy Index, then constitutional monarchies such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Scandinavian countries come out on top as being the most democratic in the world. I would also like to posit that democracies that have a first past the post system are not as democratic as those with systems of proportional representation like say, Mixed Member Proportional representation (MMP). While New Zealand used to have FPP, MMP has been in place for nearly 20 years. I think this helps the case that New Zealand is the oldest democracy. Can people please refrain from entering countries that did not have universal suffrage before 1893 - it's pointless and well, somewhat insulting. I agree with Jill, the first democracy based on Universal Adult Suffrage was New Zealand in 1893. However, New Zealand did not become an independent sovereign state until 1901 at the earliest when it achieved Dominion status. I disagree over the issue of constitutional monarchy, since such a monarchy is ceremonial and does not interfere into the workings of the executive or government. Therefore in all practical senses a constitutional monarchy is as democratic as any republic. There are plenty of republics around the World which are not even vaguely democratic. The first democracy based on Universal Male Suffrage is much more difficult to pin down. With the exception of indigenous people, the U.S. achieved Universal Male Suffrage in 1870. However, to a large extent this was on paper only. Black people were openly discouraged from voting in many Southern states until the 1960s. It's a complex issue, for example the Soviet Union achieved Universal Adult Suffrage in 1918 but no one would want to call the USSR a democracy of any real sort. So maybe democracy is more than just UAS. Perhaps its UAS plus free speech. Repeat: Isle of Man women's suffrage 1881. Earlier than New Zealand. Also, prisoners can vote in Manx elections. No one has definitively answered this question. Just like most documents, it is how a person interprets the word democracy. Heck, we cannot even agree on one interpretation of the Bible. Good luck - like most governments y'all will agree to disagree. I think if you want to answer that you need a definite definition of democracy. You also need to specify if you mean an entire country as a whole or any one province, state, region, town, kingdom, city, etc. of a country. If you mean any one part than Greece in the city of Athens. If you mean an entire country than like I said, you need a definite definition of democracy. So basically we can almost all CLAIM to be the world's oldest democracy and we can argue about it all we want, but I don't think we'll come to an accurate a","https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-80426,00.html",

Gousha asked about the House Democrats, noting they said they felt like they weren’t being heard.We heard them plenty, Ryan said.You did hear them, Gousha said. And your reaction was you’re worried about the decorum in the House. They’re talking about maybe doing more of this sort of thing when you return from recess on July 5. Are you going to handle it the same way?No, we’re not going to handle it the same way, Ryan said.What would you do differently?, Gousha asked.Well, we’re working on that, Ryan said. We will not take this. We will not tolerate this. This is the oldest deliberative body in the world. We are the oldest democracy. And we have rules of decorum so that we can peacefully settle our issues and actually have democracy.Having just celebrated our nation’s independence from England, we thought the time was right to take a look at whether the United States is the oldest democracy in the world.The Greeks first coined the term democracy to describe self rule. The term derives from the Greek word demos, meaning people. The city states of Ancient Greece, most notably Athens, ruled themselves.Many historians also consider the Roman Republic a type of democracy. But both of those empires have long since fallen and, of course, are no longer in the running to be the oldest democracy.The United States declared its independence from England on July 4, 1776.After a brief period governed by the Articles of Confederation, the founding fathers drafted a new, governing document establishing our government as it operates today. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788.PolitiFact National checked a claim on the Constitution in 2011 when former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican, said the United States has the longest surviving constitution.Defining a constitution as a single governing document, the claim was rated Mostly True. The U.S. constitution is the oldest single governing document, though other countries are governed by multiple documents older than our constitution. The Massachusetts state constitution is older, ratified in 1780, and served as a model for the authors of the U.S. Constitution.Ryan’s team sent us to that factcheck as backup for his statement that the U.S. is the oldest democracy.That founding document established our democracy, said Ian Martorana, Ryan’s press secretary. It stands to reason that if America has the oldest constitution (that founded the democracy in question), then America also has the oldest democracy.With that in mind, we turned to the history books.The founding fathers feared direct democracy, which involves people deciding directly on policy initiatives and regarded it as an ill-advised form of government. They feared tyranny of the majority as much as that of a king.Instead, they created what is typically referred to as a representative democracy or republic -- the people elect leaders who make decisions on their behalf with a system that protected minority rights.Over the years, the differences between democracies -- both representative and direct -- and republics have been hotly debated by political scholars. For our purposes, we will broadly consider a democratic state to be one in which power is vested in the people who rule themselves or are governed by those who they elect.No matter the rhetoric, the United States has been governed by representatives elected by the people since it began. And few, if any, disagree that it marked a new approach.Sean Wilentz, professor of American History at Princeton, said when this type of government emerged in the United States the monarchists and aristocrats of the old world in Europe hated it.It was radical and revolutionary, he said. It was the opposite of the formal rule of the rich and well-born.Today, we consider democratic states to be ones with universal suffrage. That is, voting rights that are extended to all citizens without restrictions based on gender, race, religion or wealth.Voting eligibility is established through a combination of the U.S. Constitution and state laws. Nearly all citizens over age 18 can vote with some exceptions, such as people in prison on felony charges.The constitution, as originally written, did not establish who would be able to vote. So, states determined for themselves who could cast ballots. In the late 1700s, the only people who were able to vote for government officials were white, male property owners.Over time, more and more groups were granted the right to vote.The 15th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1879, granted African American men the right to vote. The amendment declared the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.Due to the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other barriers, the right would not be fully realized until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed.Similarly, women were barred from voting until the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920. New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to allow all women citizens to vote in 1893.Some scholars argue that the restricted electorate made the United States undemocratic at its founding. The problems with voting enfranchisement in the United States were also issues in other early democracies.Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard said the United States truly started to become democratic when the country began to be ruled by more of the population.There is something misleading about making claims that a country which permitted only adult white men to vote was a democracy, he said. It’s hard to argue that we were a democracy while slavery existed or while African Americans were denied the franchise.No one could reasonably argue that the United States was democratic for all of its people from the beginning, but neither were other nations across the globe. Indeed, the writers of the U.S. constitution included a process for the citizens themselves to amend it over time.So, a democracy starting elsewhere in the world today would look different than the United States did when it began, but so does today's United States.And, whatever the debates of today, Wilentz noted that people called it democracy in the United States from the very beginning, and considered it a government led by the citizens rather than a ruler or ruling class.When it comes to textbooks, a typical narrative on democracy includes the examples from ancient times, then skips ahead to the United States and other European examples.Elements of democracy were introduced in other countries and localities prior to 1776.For example, San Marino, a small enclave surrounded by Italy and founded in the fourth century, claims to be the first republic. Its political system --  a parliamentary republic -- was established in a series of six books that date back to the late 1500s. But it isn't a nation and it hasn’t always been independent, coming under the authority of others.While England has a monarch as head of state, it has gradually evolved to function like a parliamentary republic. The Magna Carta of the 13th Century started to lay the groundwork for British parliament, but the Americans of 1776 clearly stated their view that the king was a despot aiming to establish an absolute Tyranny over these states. And he did attempt to crush them with his armed forces.Ryan said the United States is the oldest democracy.Our democracy is imperfect and always evolving, but that’s the nature of democracy. The changes, for better or worse, reflect the will of the people.While the United States is not the first to include elements of democracy, it is the oldest existing nation with a constitutional government in which the people elect their own government and representatives.(Editor's note: This item was posted, briefly, on July 1 with a rating of Mostly True. Our work as a judging panel continued past that point, so it was temporarily take down and now is re-posted with a final rating of True).",http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-us-oldest-democracy-world-he-righ/,

It is probable that the Athenians were not the first group of people to adopt such a system (a few places in India have traditions of local democracy that claim earlier origins) but because the Greeks named it, they have a good claim at being the “first” democracy, even though large portions of Athenian society—most notably women and slaves—could not participate.The title of oldest continuously functioning democracy is more hotly contested. Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Isle of Man all have local parliaments founded in the ninth and 10th centuries, when Vikings pillaged, plundered and set up legislative bodies on the sea-islands of far northern Europe. Iceland’s national parliament, the Althing, dates back to A.D. 930, but it spent centuries under Norwegian and Danish rule. Man and the Faroes, meanwhile, remain dependencies of the United Kingdom and Denmark, respectively.The United States is among the oldest modern democracies, but it is only the oldest if the criteria are refined to disqualify claimants ranging from Switzerland to San Marino. Some historians suggest that the Native American Six Nations confederacy (Iroquois), which traces its consensus-based government tradition across eight centuries, is the oldest living participatory democracy. Others point out that meaningful democracy only arrived at a national level in 1906, when Finland became the first country to abolish race and gender requirements for both voting and for serving in government.",http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/what-is-the-worlds-oldest-democracy,

(Is the US the “oldest democracy” in the world?) However, I’m going to disagree with Politifact.The US Constitution is said to be the oldest single document that is still continuously operative as a constitution–but that isn’t the same thing as the US being the world’s oldest democracy. And I’m not sure whether that’s true; the Constitution of San Marino dates from 1600 and is still in force. Politifact claims that this doesn’t count, because San Marino “isn't a nation and it hasn’t always been independent”. But San Marino is a member state of the UN and the Council of Europe, and maintains its own armed forces (although Italy would be responsible for defense if any serious war broke out). It sounds like a nation to me! And San Marino managed to dodge Napoleon, Italian unification, and both World Wars, except for a brief occupation by German forces in September 1944. (Are there any Sammarinese Quorans who can enlighten us further?)Anyway, that wasn’t the original question—the question is whether the US is the world’s oldest democracy (OK, democratic republic)—or at least the world’s oldest democracy that is still functioning. Here it gets tricky. The Faroe Islands have had their Løgting (“law assembly”) since Viking times. Iceland’s Alþingi (“general assembly”) also has a Viking pedigree, going back to 930; the Faroese Løgting may be older, although I’m not sure whether its “official” founding date is known. I don’t know much about the Løgting, but the saga-age Icelandic Alþingi was more of a republican government than a “pure” democracy. Most people were represented by one of thirty-nine goðar. (The word originally meant something like “pagan priest,” but the office of goði always had secular responsibilities as well, and the name was retained even after Iceland had formally adopted Christianity.) The goðar proposed, debated, and adopted new laws.Both the Løgting and the Alþingi still meet today, and you could argue that they are the oldest democratic forms of government in the world. However, the Faroes are not an independent nation—they’ve been ruled by Norway and then Denmark since 1035 and are still a Danish territory, although today they have considerable autonomy. Iceland was also a Danish possession between 1262 and 1944. The Alþingi and Løgting still operated, albeit with reduced powers—but the Løgting was disbanded from 1816 to 1852, and the Alþingi was disbanded from 1800 to 1845. So do they still “count”? Can a democratic form of government claim continuity if it’s temporarily suspended, or if it begins as an autonomous government, but continues under some other nation’s rule? If a democratic government is temporarily suspended—say, under martial law, or temporary foreign occupation—is the restored government “the same” as the old one? Icelanders and Faroe Islanders would probably say yes—but in the end, I’m not sure there’s a simple and clear-cut answer.The point is also well taken that any country that restricts women and minorities from voting can’t call itself a democracy—in which case the US didn’t become one until 1924, when all Native Americans became US citizens (four years after women got the right to vote by passage of the Nineteenth Amendment), or possibly not until the Civil Rights Movement ended the de facto disenfranchisement of African-Americans.I would have to rate Ryan’s statement as “Sort Of True, If You’re Willing To Explain Away Or Ignore The Counterexamples; If Not, Then It Gets Messy.”",https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-USA-claim-itself-to-be-the-worlds-oldest-democracy-when-the-UK-already-had-a-well-established-parliament-even-before-US-independence,

However, this claim masks several uncomfortable truths: that suffrage for a long period was restricted to rich White men; that slavery was a legal institution in the U.S. until 1865; that elections held between 1876 and 1965, particularly in the South, were largely governed by racist “Jim Crow Laws”; and that women gained the right to vote only in 1920. That apartheid was legally practiced in the U.S. until 1964 also remains largely hidden. The fact is that universal franchise became a possibility in the U.S. essentially after the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which is “a critical step in dismantling the multiple impediments to voting that had been erected between 1850s and World War I”, took effect as late as 1995.Contrary to popular beliefs, the landed-gentry and the bourgeoisie, who led the independence struggle and drafted the U.S. Constitution, did not gift freedom and democratic rights to others. Even the poor White men had to wage a determined struggle between 1790 and 1856 to slowly attain those rights. (However, again from 1871 till 1964, voting rights of these poor Whites were restricted in several states through imposition of “Poll Tax” until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution finally prohibited such taxes.) The rest of the population of the U.S. – especially African-Americans, women and post-1867 immigrants – wrested those rights through hard fought anti-slavery (abolitionist) movement, the suffragette movement, the working-class movement and the civil rights movement.In short, since it’s founding in 1776, it has taken well over 200 years of bitter struggle for the people in the U.S. as a whole to get an opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. And, when it did appear that they would begin to do so, the enactment of the PATRIOT Act following the 9/11 attack (and a series of similar draconian laws that followed), ensured that such high hopes of unfettered and universal exercise of democratic rights would continue to remain a distant dream! In fact, there was increasing concern that the U.S. was fast turning into a police state. Moreover, far from being the “world’s oldest”, universal franchise has still not been instituted de jure in the U.S., i.e., till date, the right of suffrage is not guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, whereas in India, for example, Article 326 of the Constitution guarantees the right to vote to all adult citizens. Although by 1995, the voter registration process was simplified and potentially all adult citizens could register to vote, the electoral process in the U.S. is still overshadowed by the role of money power and a highly partisan and corporate controlled media that primarily projects the interests of the wealthy class.The U.S. establishment’s self-congratulatory campaign conceals several other uncomfortable truths as well: that the “world’s oldest democracy” had no qualms about perpetuating its self interest through imperialist conquests; by supporting despotic regimes or by overthrowing democratically elected governments! That the “world’s oldest democracy”, which can afford to spend 3 trillion dollars to teach 28 million Iraqis the rudiments of “democracy”, has little concern for the basic democratic rights of 45 million poverty-stricken U.S. citizens! That the top 20 per cent U.S. households own nearly 85 per cent of the total privately held wealth! That even in 2008 just 12.4 per cent of the workforce in the “world’s oldest democracy” could join unions and exercise their democratic rights at their work place; the union membership remaining at the same level as it existed a century ago! That 40 to 60 per cent of the eligible voters never participate in the electoral process! These staggering facts are pointers to the real nature of “democracy” that is prevalent in the U.S. today. It, thus, brings forth the question as to whose interests was the U.S. Constitution actually designed to serve.On 03 March 2006, during a public address to the people of India, President George W. Bush began his speech at the Purana Qila (Old Fort) in New Delhi by saying that he was “honored to bring the good wishes and the respect of the world’s oldest democracy to the world’s largest democracy.” President Bush tried his best to use the occasion to rave about the vibrant traditions of “freedom” and “democracy” in the U.S. (and in “our two great democracies”) in order to impress Indians about what is often passed off as the 200-plus-year old “American Creed.”During President Bush’s visit, a few Indians also had the misfortune of learning the true essence of “freedom,” about which Mr. Bush was waxing eloquent, through a small incident that took place on 02 March. It so happened that the U.S. First Lady, Laura Bush, who had accompanied her husband to India, chose to pay a visit to Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity orphanage situated near a South Delhi residential colony in order to shower compassion on orphaned children. Using the opportunity to register indignation at the dismal plight of children in Iraq, one of the residents of the colony, Bela Malik, and her friends hung a banner at her residence that read “Laura Bush, How About A Photo-Op With the Orphaned, Maimed, Dead Children of Iraq.”According to The Hindu (which apparently was the only newspaper that chose not to ignore the incident), well before Laura Bush’s motorcade arrived there, the neighbourhood was virtually taken over by U.S. secret service agents, sniffer dogs and Delhi Police personnel. The report stated that, Bela Malik had noticed that the Delhi Police were taking orders from the U.S. personnel and that the local residents were not being allowed to leave their homes. Soon, on the pretext of a routine security check, an Inspector from the Delhi Police along with a sub-inspector entered Bela Malik’s residence, where a constable had already been stationed on the balcony. Quoting Bela Malik, the report said: “The inspector asked me not to shout any slogans. We assured him that we did not want to shout any slogans or hamper Ms. Bush’s visit in any way. We just wanted our banner to be displayed.”Despite Bela Malik’s assurance, the Inspector ordered the constable and the sub-inspector to remove the banner. Outraged by the highhanded behavior of the security personnel, Bela Malik told The Hindu:“We objected and said that this was a violation of individual rights because the banner was within my premises. But they confiscated the banner. When we objected, they began questioning the occupants in a threatening manner.” She further added: “In our own country, in my own residence, I am denied the right to speak the truth in a peaceful, non-aggressive manner. A white banner was security threat to the Bush establishment!”Thankfully, the Delhi Police did not go to the extent of slapping criminal charges on Bela Malik on some pretext. One wonders if this type of jittery reaction from the security personnel is any different from the way in which despotic regimes reportedly behave!This incident cannot be dismissed merely as an act of over-zealousness on the part of the Delhi Police in a bid to please the U.S. establishment since it happened under the very directions of the U.S. security personnel. In the name of security concerns, muzzling of anti U.S.-establishment protest actions are not perceived as attacks on democratic rights! However, the same U.S.-establishment has been making tall claims about its commitment to promoting freedom of speech and expression! Just three months earlier, on 09 December 2005, in a proclamation issued during the Human Rights Week, President Bush had proudly stated:“We are promoting democracies that respect freedom of speech …and freedom of the press …We are standing with dissidents and exiles against oppressive regimes and tyranny…. As we observe Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we renew our commitment to building a world where human rights are respected and protected by the rule of law and where all people can enjoy freedom and dignity.”Contrary to the said laudatory precepts, Bela Malik and her friends had the bitter experience of knowing exactly how dedicated the U.S. Administration was in promoting freedom of speech and just how tolerant it was of dissent!Even earlier, on 20 January 2005, during his Inaugural Speech at the time of assuming office for the second time, President George Bush had reiterated that human rightsThe words “freedom” and “democracy” appear incessantly – at least thirty to forty times – in each of President Bush’s major speeches, including his speech in Delhi. At the same time, one cannot help noticing that almost every speech of President Bush was replete with disparaging remarks about the lack of “freedom” and “democracy” in nations, which he considered were not part of the pro-U.S. camp. In the light of the above-mentioned gagging incident at Delhi, the hollowness of the U.S. establishment’s claim of being the flag-bearer of “freedom” and “democracy” in the world, thereby, stands completely exposed. In fact, after the enactment of the PATRIOT Act in 2001, and through similar laws that were enacted subsequently to curtail civil rights within the U.S., there was no way that the U.S. establishment could even pretend that it was the guardian of such lofty ideals! However, these retrograde steps have not prevented the U.S. establishment from indulging in doublespeak.The myth that the U.S. is the “world’s oldest democracy” was reiterated yet again recently by the U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, at the time of signing the Indo-US Nuclear Deal in Washington, DC, on 10 October 2008. However, the grave irony is that it was a person of Ms. Rice’s background, who has had first-hand experience of the ground realities that legally prevailed in the United States as late as 1995, who has repeated this tall claim. The truth was, in her childhood, Ms. Rice has had the ignominy of suffering the worst aspects of the apartheid system that was prevalent in her home town of Birmingham in Alabama, which was one of the notorious Southern states of the United States infamous for its racist prejudices. According to a news report: “A childhood friend [of Ms. Rice], 11-year-old Denise McNair, was one of the four young girls killed in the bombing of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963 [by a racist group].”Despite this personal tragedy, Ms. Rice never chose to get involved with the civil rights movement at any time although she had enough political acumen to subsequently become the U.S. Secretary of State. The same Ms. Rice, who has been totally indifferent to the racially discriminatory social conditions in her neighborhood, now unabashedly claims that the U.S. was the “world’s oldest democracy”! President Bush repeated this claim again on 29 November 2008 in the context of the terrorist attack on Mumbai when he stated that: “And as the people of the world’s largest democracy recover from these attacks, they can count on the world’s oldest democracy to stand by their side.”It is in this background that an attempt is being made here to examine, with the aid of historical records, the veracity of Mr. Bush’s and Ms. Rice’s claims. Unfortunately for them and their ilk, the history of USA is rather well documented and the records are carefully conserved in numerous archives and libraries; several scholars have also carried out painstaking research and have placed a lot of that material in this regard in the public domain including on the Internet as well.Apparently, even Senator Barak Obama, in the midst of his campaign for presidential nomination, made the politically correct statement that: “The world’s oldest democracy [USA] and the world’s largest democracy [India] are natural partners, sharing important interests and fundamental democratic values.” Senator Obama stated this in an article that he wrote for India Abroad (a magazine published in North America) on 29 February 2008. Senator Obama, a mulatto born in 1961, had spent his childhood in Hawaii and Java and had grown up in the White household of his maternal grandparents in Hawaii. Yet, from 1971 onward he did experience racial prejudices and understood what it meant to be an African-American. After his graduation, he chose to become a civil-rights activist and, therefore, is seemingly well versed in U.S. history, especially about the civil-rights movement. Under the circumstances, Senator Obama’s claim that the U.S. is the “world’s oldest democracy” does not gel with the realities on the ground as is described below. (The state of the “world’s largest democracy” will be discussed separately.)Early Phase of “Democracy” in the U.S.The history of USA is not that old since immigrants from Europe had founded it only in 1776. These immigrants had started settling along the east coast of North America from the beginning of the 17th century after forcibly driving away its earlier inhabitants – the Native American-Indians – further west. The original country consisted of thirteen former British colonies, which was bound on the north by the then British Canada, on the south by the then Spanish Florida, on the west by the Appalachian Mountains, and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and covered an area that was less than six per cent of what it is today.By the latter half of the eighteenth century, the economic structure of the British colonies in North America was composed of slave and free labour, of pre-capitalist and capitalist forms and forces of production, which was largely controlled by the landed gentry and the emerging bourgeoisie. In 1764, in an attempt to offset Britain’s war debt brought on by its war against the French and American-Indians and to help pay for the expenses of running its newly acquired territories, Britain began to levy additional taxes on its American subjects and increase duties on British goods imported to America. Britain’s decision to raise additional revenue by such methods was highly resented by the colonists, who found it an opportune movement to oppose British domination. Thus began the successful decade-long movement for independence. The Declaration of Independence on 04 July 1776 was followed by the adoption of the U.S. Constitution on 17 September 1787, and the ratification of the Bill of Rights on 15 December 1791. These steps supposedly signalled the establishment of freedom and democracy in USA. If that was so, the terms “freedom” and “democracy” had totally different connotations then than what they have assumed at present because at that time only a tiny minority of its then 2.5 million population directly benefited from such laudatory precepts.The Declaration of Independence had proclaimed that: “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Indeed, all men and women are created equal! However, the astonishing fact, which has gone largely unnoticed, was that for over 200 years after the U.S. Constitution was adopted neither were all men nor all women ever treated as equals in the United States. As far as Native American-Indians and African-Americans were concerned, throughout this period the bulk of them had a hard time trying to ensure their very survival and to fend off threats to their personal safety. Under constant life-threatening situations, the question of exercising “unalienable Rights” such as “Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” had remained a rather far-fetched dream for most of them. The utter incongruousness between laudatory precepts on which the United States was founded and actual practice since it’s founding is what is sought to be unravelled in this essay.It is apparent that most of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. “democratic” system were more anxious about safeguarding the interests of the big landowners (the Patroons, the Manor lords) and the bourgeoisie and less bothered about addressing the concerns of the vast majority of the people within the United States then. In the initial period following independence, a mixture of property and residency requirements had drastically restricted suffrage rights. When the first presidential election was held in 1789, the electorate that elected George Washington as President were mostly landlords or bourgeoisie, who were exclusively White males. (Reportedly, only about 38,818 adult White males voted in the 1789 election, which apparently constituted about 1.6 percent of the then total adult population of those states casting electoral votes. ) Between 1790 and 1856, these restrictions were slowly relaxed, and the electorate expanded to include nearly all the long-residing adult White males. However, it was only after poor sections of adult White males launched agitations that they managed to secure their voting rights. In addition, these restrictions were relaxed not because of altruistic motives; it was more out of compulsion and for safeguarding the self-interest of the elites.According to U.S. historian, Alexander Keysser:Ultimately, pure self-interest was a major factor. With the growing threat of slave rebellion, under the guise of White solidarity, enfranchising all White Southerners was a safe way of ensuring that the poor Whites would serve in the militia to protect the slave owners. Economic interest also played a role in expansion of franchise. As newly acquired territories began to organize themselves into States, inhabitants of those sparsely populated regions opted for White adult franchise in order to attract new settlers, a move that would potentially raise land value, encourage economic development and increase tax revenues. Male immigrants from Europe, who came in large number, were enfranchised in this process (until their suffrage right was again restricted through the introduction of the “poll tax” in 1871.) However, according to Keyssar:Women, American-Indians, African-Americans, Hispanics and those of Asian origin continued to be denied the right of franchise.Another notable feature was that the Founding Fathers were totally indifferent to the fate of the slaves, who were imported from Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries (and early 19th century as well) and who constituted 19 per cent of the total settler population of about 4 million at the time of the first U.S. census in 1790. In the prevailing “democratic spirit” of the times, slavery was legally permitted in the “world’s oldest democracy” under various provisions of the U.S. Constitution, clearly demonstrating the extent of influence wielded by the slave-owners in framing that Constitution. However, it is interesting to note that the Founding Fathers were too embarrassed to use the word “slave” or “slavery” in their debates or in the Constitution itself. Instead, they opted to use euphemisms such as “other persons” and “persons held to service or labor”, which clearly revealed the duplicity of the Founding Fathers in this regard. Explicit reference to slavery was first incorporated into the U.S. Constitution only on 06 December 1865 through the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery.The initial convoluted reference to slavery appeared in the 1787 U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 2, Paragraph iii, which afforded states seats in the House of Representatives according to population, with each slave being counted as “three-fifths of a person.” Not only did this arrangement allow slavery to continue, but it also meant that slaveholders would have disproportionate influence. While the slaves themselves were denied all democratic rights, effectively one slave-owner who owned 100 slaves enjoyed the same degree of representation in the U.S. Congress as 60 non-slave-owning citizens did. Since most of the slaves were confined to the big plantations in the South, the Southern states wielded far more clout in the decision-making process than the Northern states despite the majority of the U.S. citizens then – bulk of whom were non-slave-holders – being residents of the North.The next allusion to the institution of slavery was in Article I, Section 9, Paragraph I, which stipulated that:This clause prohibited the U.S. Congress from banning the import of slaves into USA before the year 1808 with the proviso that even if a tax or duty is imposed on such importation, it should not exceed ten dollars for each slave. Thus, not only did the U.S. Constitution completely protect slave trade, it also explicitly barred the U.S. Congress from attempting to substantially raise the import duty on slaves as a way of discouraging and ending the slave trade before the year 1808.The last indirect reference to slavery is found in the 1787 U.S. Constitution in Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph iii. This was essentially the “fugitive-slave” clause that ordained that:That is to say, even if a slave escapes to a free state with laws prohibiting slavery, he/she still must be returned to his/her rightful owner to whom he/she owes his/her services in the slave state. He/she was still a slave no matter where he/she was, as long as he/she belonged to his/her master. It is very much obvious that specific clauses for protection of slavery were ingrained into the original U.S. Constitution without ever using the words “slave” or “slavery”!Vermont, which broke away from New York to form a separate state in 1777, became the first State in the U.S. to constitutionally abolish the institution of slavery within its borders, with the State of Pennsylvania soon following its lead in 1780. (The only state to abolish slavery before independence was Rhode Island in 1774.) Although all other Northern states took similar steps by 1804, the gradual emancipation laws prolonged the actual process of abolition of slavery even in most of the Northern states well into the 1850s.Unmindful of the developments in the Northern states, the U.S. Congress decided to toughen the disguised “fugitive slave” clause in the original U.S. Constitution. On 12 February 1793, it adopted the Fugitive Slave Act, 1793 that not only made it a federal offence to assist an escaping slave but also created a legal mechanism by which escaped slaves could be seized and returned to their masters. Under the Act every escaped slave was made a fugitive-for-life, liable to recapture at any time anywhere within the territory of the United States. Soon slave-catching developed into an organised industry in the “world’s oldest democracy” with hardly any mechanism even to restrain unscrupulous slave-catchers from unlawfully seizing free Blacks and selling them into slavery. The terrifying impact that the Act had on the daily lives of the African-American population all over the United States may well be imagined.Fifty-seven years later, the pro-slavery laws in the “world’s oldest democracy” was further reinforced when the Fugitive Slave Act, 1850 was adopted by the U.S. Congress on 18 September 1850 to make any law-enforcement official who fails to execute an arrest warrant issued for the arrest of an alleged runaway slave liable to a fine of $1,000. Officials everywhere in the United States were now duty-bound to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave on the basis of nothing more than a claimant’s sworn testimony of ownership. The person suspected of being a fugitive slave was left with no means of self-defence, since Section 6 of the Act had clearly stated that: “In no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence.” In addition, any person – whether Black or White – aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was to be subjected to six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. On the other hand, officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to monetary benefits in the form of a fee for their work. Ultimately, the sheer brutality with which the despicable witch-hunt was conducted all over USA impelled the abolitionists to redouble their quest for speedy abolition of slavery.Although for a long time, the potential threat from slave insurrections were underplayed and given little attention, fear of insurrection was ultimately an important motivating factor behind the opposition to slavery. According to U.S. historian Herbert Aptheker’s study titled American Negro Slave Revolts (1943), there were at least 250 recorded cases of slave revolts in the U.S. Notable slave insurrections such as the ones led by Gabriel Prosser in Virginia (1800), Denmark Vesey in South Carolina (1822), and by Nat Turner in Virginia (1831) instilled fear into the slave-owners, who tried to tackle the problem by intensifying repressive measures. In addition, the freedoms of all “free” Black people in the Southern states were not only severely curtailed but also an official policy was instituted that forbade questioning the slave system on the grounds that any discussion might encourage similar slave revolts. Since Turner was literate and had claimed he had got his inspiration from the Bible, all literate slaves were perceived as potential insurgents. Thus, the Nat Turner rebellion also became a convenient excuse for passing anti-literacy laws.That growth of literacy among slaves posed a potent threat to the institution of slavery was exemplified by the writings of David Walker (1785-1830), who was born free, of a free mother and a slave father in North Carolina, one of the Southern states. He was fortunate enough to learn to read and write and to have had the opportunity of studying a variety of subjects. Around 1815, he left the South to settle in the Northern State of Massachusetts, where slavery had been effectively abolished in 1783. In 1829, Walker published a pamphlet titled “Walker’s Appeal”, which bitterly denounced the institution of slavery along with all those who profited by it and all those who tolerated it.In the said “Appeal,” for instance, Walker made apt references to the Declaration of Independence to expose the hypocrisy of the U.S. establishment in defending the institution of slavery. He argued:The slave-owners were dumbfounded by Walker’s many such simple and straightforward but devastating arguments. They responded in a typically authoritarian-fashion by imposing a ban on the spread of literacy among the Black population. The legislatures in the Southern states actually went to the extent of passing legislations that made it a crime to teach Blacks – whether free or slave – how to read and write! These legislatures also offered a reward for Walker’s capture, $10,000 alive and $1,000 dead. As a result, Walker, when he was only 45 years old, was found dead at his home in Boston on 28 June 1830, under mysterious circumstances. Yet, Walker and those like him had made their contribution to the revolutionary task of abolishing slavery, which was finally achieved by force of arms in the ensuing Civil War that broke out some 30 years later.Before their legal emancipation in 1865, most African-Americans were denied basic human rights, including the right to education. Even as late as 1860, less than 05 per cent of the slave population, which grew from 700,000 in 1790 to 4 million in 1860, was literate. It may appear incredible that in the sixteen Southern states and in some other states such as California of the “world’s oldest democracy”, anti-literacy laws were enacted and strictly enforced well until 1865. All those who were guilty of defying these laws by daring to give instruction to Blacks or Mulattos (progenies of mixed African/European parentage) were severely punished with hefty fines and/or brutal whipping. For example, Article 6, Section 10 of the Laws of the State of Alabama in force in 1833 had unambiguously stated that:Likewise, Article I, Section II of the Law of the State of Georgia, which was in force in 1848, had decreed that punishment for teaching slaves or free persons of color to read and write would be as follows:It was as though these abhorrent laws were taken straight out of the code of laws in Ancient India, the Manu Smriti or Manu’s Code of Laws, which included bigoted edicts that prohibited the acquisition of knowledge by the shudra (untouchable castes). Due to the anti-literacy laws and the intimidation and terror that ensued, there was a sharp decline in the literacy rate among slaves, which as per the census data fell from 15 per cent in 1830 to just 5 percent in 1860. By the 1850s, teachers from the Northern states, who were suspected of harbouring abolitionist views, were expelled from the Southern states and a ban was imposed on abolitionist literature there.N.D.

And perception is nine tenths of reality.   As the Greeks saw it, the what we call Democracy is nothing like their idea of it. I go along with Iceland, which at least elected the government.   That said England's claim is not as tenuous as many make out. First lets consider the state of play in 1067, Guillam Le Batard needs support, he has put in control of various bits of the country he is in the process of conquering some ambitious Barons (Counts, Dukes etc.), he wants to keep them on side. So he says you help me decide what Taxes to raise.  Now the poor old Anglo-Saxons are the ones that are going to pay, so the Earls (well oh alright Earl is an Anglo-Saxon word but you get the gist) say yes we agree to that amount, and promptly screw the Anglo-Saxons for the Tax (plus a bit for their own coffers).   Now fast forward to 1215 the Barons have fallen out with King John, They demand that he stop Sh**ging their wives, daughters, sisters, aunties, Grandmothers (anything over 12 and female) and let them decide what the tax rate should be. So on 15th June 1215 they met on a muddy field and got him to put his seal at the bottom of this Charta and say that he would only tax his subjects with the consent of the representatives of those subjects. (actually it doesn't quite say that but it amounts to the same) . From that point on England is governed (despite King John and his successors best efforts to ignore Magna Charta) by consent. Henry 8th, James 1st and especially Charles 1st tried their damnedest to ignore it but basically England was ruled by consent.   It wasn't a Democracy in the modern sense, but then neither was Athens or USA until recently.",https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100326043317AA4noG5,

While Indians see America as a particularly close ally (70%), across the border in Pakistan, the opposite is true, with more than half (62%) expressing a negative view.According to the data, India’s opinion of the US has rapidly changed. Backed by improving relations between the world’s two largest democracies—and a bonhomie between their leaders—India’s rating of the US has jumped by 14% since 2013.This is in contrast to China, where opinion has mostly remained unchanged—and Russia, where America’s ratings continue to fall.Indians seem to have much faith in US president Barack Obama, even though his ratings have taken a hit in America. About three-fourths of people in India surveyed believe that Obama takes bold, positive decisions on world affairs, up from 48% a year ago. Opinion in China, however, was sharply divided, with 44% of respondents reporting confidence in the US president, and another 41% doubting his leadership capabilities in international affairs.Overall, however, Obama has globally improved his image and remains immensely popular in Europe, Asia and Africa.As the world debates over whether to label the interrogation methods used by the United States in its war on terror after September 11 as torture, respondents in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America said that they did not believe the US was justified in using them.But India stands in sharp contrast, with 57% of respondents saying they believe the US was justified in using its interrogation methods.While many countries believe that China will eventually overtake the United States and become the world’s superpower, Indians appear unsure. This could be in part because India harbours its own goals towards becoming a global superpower.Editor’s note: Readers on Facebook have questioned our calling the US the world’s oldest democracy.

At some point if the franchise is super small, like 1% of the population, or just a small cabal of potentates, that is an oligarchy and at that point the franchise issue would disqualify the country from being a democracy.  However I think that as long as the primary decision making power of a country is beholden to the people, even if just say, 25% of them, that's enough of a benchmark to call that country a democracy.

The argument consists of two points, that the US is a democracy, and that it is the oldest of world democracies. Plolitifact accepts this argument (under specific definitions), but I disagree with both points of the argument.To say that something is the oldest is an ambiguous term. For example, the oldest government could mean:It is generally assumed that this argument uses the third meaning.Whenever we talk about the lifespan of a government, we have to determine what criteria should be used to decide when the government was formed or replaced. For example, France has existed as a nation in name for over 1,000 years, but in that time its government has been restructured from a monarchy to a representative democracy, so there is no reasonable way to claim it's current government was formed 1,000 years ago.When determining the how different the government has changed, you not only have to look at how the government itself functions, but you also have to consider how it affects the individual citizens. For example, in the United States, we see practically no change in governance from the perspective of a land-owning white man from today back to when the country won its independence, but the governance change for black women was so drastically different it could warrant being described as a new form of government.A democracy is any form of government that is ruled by its citizens rather than a limited group or individual, but citizen rule is a spectrum of several metrics. Some of the metrics sociologists look at to measure democracy include:There are no agreed upon minimum values for these metrics to determine when a government is a democracy as opposed to an oligarchy, and even nations which maintain monarchies are viewed today as democracies provided the people have a high degree of autonomy.Since oldest and democracy are both fuzzy terms, it would be better to focus on criteria that are more concrete. Here is a list of some of the attributes found in democracies, which nation first implemented them, which extant nations continue to implement them, and when the US began implementing them.The simplicity of the original claim often belies the ignorance of the claimant. It's as though they're claiming that the US was the first nation to have freedom. To which the informed would ask, freedom in what way, and for whom?The only way I can see this claim being accurate is if it were reworded in the following way:The United States is the oldest extant democracy, excluding those with a concurrent oligarchy, and assuming you define democracy to include nations where most citizens can't vote, and the upper class owns other people as slaves.",http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Claim:_The_United_States_Is_the_Oldest_Democracy,
Donald Trump mocked someone with a disability.,http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/,True,True,False,Can not judge,True,True,the candidate mocked a reporter with a disability last November.,"Trump's Worst Offense? Mocking Disabled Reporter, Poll Finds","When asked in a recent Bloomberg poll what bothered them most about Donald Trump — of a slew of controversies — likely voters picked one action above all others:When the candidate mocked a reporter with a disability last November.Democrats have made sure the public has seen and heard about Trump's extended riff over and over again. It has been played in ads created by the Clinton campaign, including a highly-circulated one involving children silently watching, and by groups working on Clinton's behalf.Bill Clinton even said in his convention speech that his wife never made fun of people with disabilities. She tried to empower them based on their ability.And Clinton surrogate Tom Harkin, a prominent voice on disability policy, said recently, “Democrats believe in working together and bringing people with disabilities in to develop policy. Donald Trump? He makes fun of people with disabilities. That’s a throwback to a half a century ago.”Trump has denied that he meant to mock the reporter, Serge Kovaleski, who has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition affecting the joints.His initial offense, in Trump's eyes, was denying the candidate's description of Kovaleski's reporting on unsubstantiated allegations that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated on 9/11.As recently as July 29, Trump insisted, “I didn’t know what he looked like. I didn’t know he was disabled.He has maintained that his physical affect in imitation of Kovaleski was because He was groveling, grovel, grovel, grovel. That was the end of it. All of a sudden, I get reports that I was imitating a reporter who was handicapped. I would never do that.The Washington Post’s factchecker responded, “Much of what Trump says is Four-Pinocchios false.”Among other falsehoods described by the Post, including the fact that the groveling charge makes no sense in context, and Kovaleski, who now works for the New York Times, has said, Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years.The poll was conducted before Trump sparked furor with a comment about Second Amendment people that was interpreted by many as a veiled suggestion of violence against Clinton.Still, given the lasting stigma around people with disabilities and the easiness with which pop culture has mocked them over the years, the outraged reaction from the public is striking.People are starting to see people with disabilities for their abilities,” said Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, president of the advocacy group RespectAbility, citing Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, who has Attention Deficit Disorder, and Nyle DiMarco, winner of America’s Next Top Model and Dancing with the Stars, who is deaf.“But one thing they don’t want to see about people with disabilities is for us to be bullied,” she added.“The reaction to it, that so many people say it’s the worst thing he’s done, is indicative that we’ve turned a corner, where it’s just not socially acceptable the way it was,” said writer and activist Andrew Pulrang.Related: Is There Anything Donald Trump Can't Say?Still, he said he found himself wondering, “Why is this the thing that is worse than all the other groups than he’s targeted?” One possible answer: “We’re easy to feel protective towards. Part of ableism is a heavy dose of paternalism.”Pulrang hopes the outrage translates into more interest in policies that affect people with disability. There are other things more important than hurting our feelings,” he said. “We have no idea if Trump has any ideas about disability policy.”Though several Republican primary candidates filled out a candidate questionnaire produced by Mizrahi’s group, Trump has yet to do so.“Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton filled it out in full, and spoke about disability issues at the Democratic convention, as did people with disabilities themselves,” Mizrahi said.Some of the Democrats' attempts to draw a contrast with Trump around people with disabilities have drawn mixed feelings from advocates.For example, the Democratic SuperPAC Priorities USA created an ad featuring the parents of a child with spina bifida. The father’s final words are, “When I saw Donald Trump mock someone with a disability, it showed me his soul. It showed me his heart. And I didn’t like what I saw.”The ad drew some criticism from the disability rights community.“It follows a pattern that we’re very used to, which is that it’s on our behalf,” said Pulrang. “We didn’t hear from the disabled daughter, who seemed from the ad to conceivably be able to have an opinion of her own. Almost as if the real problem is that the parents were offended.”Still, Pulrang added, a few weeks later, Priorities USA came out with another ad that did feature a person with a disability speaking directly, which many activists appreciated.For people who are used to condescension or outright erasure, Trump's behavior carries a certain irony.“Inclusivity for people with disabilities is now a matter of presidential politics,” wrote David Perry at the Atlantic. “That likely wasn’t Trump’s intention when he mocked that reporter months ago. But it’s a satisfying result.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-worst-offense-mocking-disabled-reporter-poll-finds-n627736,

Trump referenced the Paris attacks by invoking the 9/11 terrorist attack on New York in 2001, in the process not only repeating the long since debunked claim that crowds of “Arabs” (or “Muslims” or “Palestinians”) were seen in local streets cheering the attack, but claiming that he had personally witnessed the phenomenon:Shortly afterwards, defending his remarks during an appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Trump maintained:There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down. And that tells you something. It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don’t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.After Trump was widely criticized for attempting to pass off an urban legend as fact, the candidate responded by citing as proof of his claim an 18 September 2001 Washington Post article by reporter Serge Kovaleski that made passing reference to “people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks”:When Kovaleski pointed out that there were never any reports (not even unsubstantiated ones) of “thousands” or even “hundreds” of people celebrating the 9/11 attacks in the New York area, as Trump claimed to have witnessed, Trump countered with a retort in which he criticized the journalist for attempting to “back away” from his previous article and seemingly mocked Kovaleski’s physical appearance.Serge Kovaleski suffers from arthrogryposis, a condition which limits the movement of joints and is particularly noticeable in Kovaleski’s right arm and hand. After referring to Kovaleski as “a nice reporter,” Trump launched into an impression of him, pointedly flopping his right arm around with his hand held at an odd angle while saying (in imitation of Kovaleski): “Now, the poor guy, you’ve got to see this guy: ‘Uhh, I don’t know what I said. Uhh, I don’t remember,’ he’s going like ‘I don’t remember. Maybe that’s what I said'”:After Trump then became the center of a second, even bigger controversy for supposedly having callously mocked a disabled reporter in public (that Trump was mocking Kovaleski was undeniable, but whether he was specifically mocking Kovaleski’s appearance and disability was a subject of debate), Trump asserted that the whole thing was just a coincidence — he had no idea who Kovaleski was and thus couldn’t have been aware of his physical condition:I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovalski [sic], is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. I don’t know if he is J.J. Watt or Muhammad Ali in his prime or somebody of less athletic or physical ability. Despite having one of the all-time great memories, I certainly do not remember him. I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago. If Mr. Kovaleski is handicapped, I would not know because I do not know what he looks like. If I did know, I would definitely not say anything about his appearance.Trump’s claims to non-memory were widely considered to be disingenuous, as Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively while working for the Daily News from 1987 to 1993 and had interviewed and talked to the business magnate numerous times during that period:The New York Times, Kovaleski’s current employer, said in a statement that “We think it’s outrageous that [Donald Trump] would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.” Trump responded in familiar fashion, issuing a series of tweets in which he admonished Kovaleski to “stop using his disability to grandstand” and repeatedly disparaged the Times:Somebody at the financially failing and totally biased New York Times said that, over the years, I have met Mr. Kovaleski. Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago — if I ever met him at all, which I doubt I did. He should stop using his disability to grandstand get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes.",https://www.snopes.com/2016/07/28/donald-trump-criticized-for-mocking-disabled-reporter/,

At a South Carolina rally in November 2015, Trump jerked his arms and said, “Now, the poor guy, you ought to see this guy, ‘Ah, I don’t know what I said, I don’t remember, I don’t remember, maybe that’s what I said.’”Trump went after the reporter ― whom he also called “nice” ― because Kovaleski denied that a story he co-wrote in 2001 substantiated Trump’s claim that “thousands” of people in New Jersey cheered the fall of the World Trade Center. No evidence supports Trump’s claim.“The sad part about it is, it didn’t in the slightest bit jar or surprise me that Donald Trump would do something this low-rent, given his track record,” Kovaleski said after the incident. Kovaleski declined to comment Monday.Since facing criticism over his behavior, Trump has repeatedly tried to backpedal. He claimed that he did not know what the reporter looked like ― Kovaleski has, in fact, closely covered Trump in the past ― and was merely “mocking the fact that the reporter was trying to pull away from a story.”Last year, Trump said that he would never mock a person with a disability because he spends “millions a year, or millions of dollars on ramps, and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over.” Federal law actually requires Trump to make his buildings accessible to Americans with disabilities.Streep said on Sunday, “it kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can’t get it out of my head, because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life.” She later added, “When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.”",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-reporter-disability_us_58738c2fe4b043ad97e473f2,

This time, it revolved around remarks Trump made almost a year ago about a disabled reporter.At one point in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton said, He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.So who’s right? Here’s the background, which we have looked at before.At at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump referred to New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. At the time, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as  thousands and thousands of people were cheering the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.To defend this account, Trump cited a Sept. 18, 2001, story co-written by Kovaleski, who was a Washington Post reporter at the time. Near the bottom of the story, the Post reporters wrote that law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.However, the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred, as Kovaleski later explained.I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember, Kovaleski told the Washington Post Fact Checker in November 2015. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that a number of people -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating.At the rally where he discussed Kovaleski, Trump said, You gotta see this guy and wildly flailed his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouted in a weird, agitated voice: Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints and has left his right hand sharply angled at the wrist. Kovaleski speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of him talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.)Many observers took Trump’s comments and motions as mocking Kovaleski. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters. And people who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag AMCStrong.Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, said that Trump clearly was mocking his disability. That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that. (Reiskin said she was giving her view since her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose candidates.)Reiskin said such behavior by Trump portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added.But Trump denied it. He tweeted, Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!He also said in a statement at the time, I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago.Trump insisted that he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition.Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years, Kovaleski told the New York Times.In fact, Kovaleski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the inaugural voyage of the Trump Shuttle airline.In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovaleski at the rally, calling him a nice reporter. He also described him as the poor guy and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance (you gotta see this guy) before launching into his imitation.After our fact-check appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed both Trump’s original comments and subsequent ones he made on the same subject in Colorado. The Fact Checker concluded that Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski and it gave Trump its lowest rating, Four Pinocchios.In the meantime, some Trump supporters have shared other examples in which Trump has shaken his hands and used an odd tone of voice to refer to other people.In one video, Trump is shown referring to one of his primary rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with flailing arms and an exaggerated voice. (See it here.) In another, he uses similar, if more subdued, motions when referring to an unnamed general. (See it here.)However, neither of these examples support Trump’s denial in the debate. In the videos, Trump was clearly mocking both Cruz and the unnamed general. In fact, the video about the general -- produced by a Trump supporter -- says explicitly that he was mocking the general.In other words, the most you could say about these bits of evidence is that they demonstrate that Trump is an equal-opportunity mocker. They don’t help refute Clinton’s charge that Trump mocked Kovaleski.The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry after the debate.Trump said that Clinton is wrong to say he mocked a disabled reporter.Trump may deny that he intentionally mocked Kovaleski for his disability, but many Americans believe his remarks amounted to mocking, and we concur that that’s a reasonable -- indeed, perhaps the only -- interpretation of his actions. The notion that Trump’s comments about Cruz and a general undercut Clinton’s claim don’t hold water, because all three examples constitute mocking, whether a disability was involved or not.

This was most notable during Meryl Streep’s emotionally charged acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award.While the actress did not name him once, she rebuked the President-elect for imitating a disabled reporter. Streep declared that it was the one performance this year which shocked her and argued it “gives permission” for others to do the same.This is a reference to when Mr Trump mocked the New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski.“There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart,” Streep said in front of a visibly shocked audience. “Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job.“It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie, it was real life.”The Republican billionaire hit back by dismissing Streep as a “Hillary lover” in an interview with the New York Times. He also denied mocking Mr Kovaleski.“I was never mocking anyone. I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story”, he said. “People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.”Back in November 2015, Mr Trump was widely condemned for mocking a reporter’s disability during a campaign speech.The Republican imitated The New York Times’ culture and investigative reporter during a rally for supporters in South Carolina.Mr Kovaleski suffers from arthrogryposis, a congenital condition affecting how his joints move.Mr Trump made several offensive gestures while defending a claim he made a few days earlier in which he said he had witnessed thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating on the day of the 9/11 attacks.This claim has reportedly since been discredited by government and law officials who were in New Jersey in the days following the terrorist attack.A 2001 article written by Mr Kovaleski for the Washington Post had claimed that “authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river” in Jersey city, within hours of the planes crashing into the World Trade Centre.But Mr Kovaleski told CNN this week: “We did a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials for the broader story. Much of that has, indeed, faded from memory.“But I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating.  That was not the case, as best as I can remember it.”Mr Trump was referencing these comments during his speech when he imitated Mr Kovaleski.He said: “The poor guy. You’ve got to see this guy.  Ah, I don’t remember what I said!  I don’t remember!”, while jerking his arms and hands in a manner mocking Mr Kovaleski’s condition.The presidential candidate’s campaign spokeswoman declined to comment on the incident, but another campaign official said the entrepreneur was “not aware of any condition and was not mocking his physical appearance in any way,” according to the Washington Post.The official added that Mr Trump “was merely emphasising the uncertainty of the verbal/written statement provided by the reporter in regards to his article”.It is understood that Mr Trump is familiar with Mr Kovaleski as the latter covered him while a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s to early 1990s.The New York Times has said it was “outrageous” for Mr Trump to have ridiculed Mr Kovaleski’s appearance.“We think it’s outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters,” a spokeswoman for the newspaper said at the time.Following the incident, Mr Kovaleski said: “The sad part about it is, it didn’t in the slightest bit jar or surprise me that Donald Trump would do something this low-rent, given his track record,” reports the Washington Post.Mr Trump was much criticised on social media for the stunt, with a petition even being started on the change.org website to “make Trump apologise to Serge Kovaleski”.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/golden-globes-2017-awards-donald-trump-mock-disabled-reporter-meryl-streep-serge-f-kovaleski-a7517026.html,

It was real life.And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modelled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence.And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. O.K., go on with it.As my friend, the dear departed Princess Leia, said to me once, take your broken heart, make it into art.After being made aware of her speech, President-elect Trump hit back at the three-time Oscar winner, dismissing her as a “a Hillary lover.He told the New York Times he had not seen Ms. Streep’s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony, but added that he was “not surprised” that he had come under attack from “liberal movie people”.Donald Trump sparks outrage as he mocks disabled reporter during speechDonald Trump slams ‘Hillary lover’ Meryl Streep after actress destroys him with her impassioned Golden Globes speechMeryl Streep destroys Donald Trump with impassioned speech at the Golden Globes as Jimmy Fallon likens him to Game of Thrones’ evil King Joffrey",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2567899/why-did-donald-trump-mock-disabled-reporter-serge-kovaleski-and-what-did-meryl-streep-say-at-the-golden-globes/,

'""Ah, I don't know what I said!

'Ah, I don't know what I said! I don't remember!'Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition that has locked his right arm up against his chest in a similar position to the one Trump held.He said Trump was mocking his disability; Trump denied knowing who Kovaleski was.The reporter then said he was on first-name terms with Trump and had interviewed him around a dozen times over the past 30 years.But videos from 2016, 2015 and 2005 and featured on Catholics 4 Trump, show Trump doing similar - albeit shorter and less involved - impressions on several other occasions.A video from October 2015 has Trump talking about banking regulators.'When you see the president of the bank, I mention the word regulator-' he breaks off to perform the role of the bank president, hunching his shoulders and limply shaking his wrist and head.Another clip, taken at the same rally Trump mocked Kovaleski, has Trump complaining about a general being asked about ISIS.He performs similar - though more restrained - movements, waving his arms and shaking his head.And in a clip from February this year, Trump mocks Ted Cruz for being a poor public speaker, again hunching his shoulders and shaking his arms.The site also hosted an even earlier clip, from a 2005 Larry King interview, in which Trump pulls another limp-wristed posture while imagining how happy he would be to go on a two-week vacation.Trump's remarks about Kovaleski came as he defended his debunked claim that he saw 'thousands' of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11.The candidate said this was 'well covered' in the media at the time, although no footage of such parties ever turned up.In defense, Trump pointed to Kovaleski's Washington Post article from September 18, 2001, in which the reporter said: 'law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.'Kovaleski later said: 'I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember.'It was that remark that Trump mocked in his South Carolina speech.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790226/Trump-s-impression-disabled-reporter-just-result-limited-repertoire-impressions.html,

Trump’s policies will be a disaster for people like me.,"It’s the early hours of Wednesday morning, and I’m watching my friends fear for their lives on Twitter. We’ve just learned that Donald J. Trump will be the next president of the United States. People are talking about the likelihood that they’ll lose health insurance when the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the fear that the attendant who helps them get dressed in the morning will no longer be available when Medicaid is slashed, the possibility that their conversations with their therapist may no longer be private, the impossibility of paying out of pocket for the medications, in-home care, assistive technology, and other essential parts of disabled life. Like many other people with disabilities, we’re terrified by the prospect of a Trump administration and what it may bring to people like us.Much has been made over (now President-elect) Donald Trump’s mocking of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski last year. Spurred by the widespread outrage at Trump’s cruelty, the Democratic National Committee made disability rights a high-profile theme of its 2016 convention. But for most disability rights activists and disabled people I know, the choice to oppose Trump had relatively little to do with his mockery of Kovaleski — or his alleged description of deaf actress Marlee Matlin as “retarded,” or even his efforts to kick disabled veteran street vendors off public sidewalks near his buildings. None of us were particularly thrilled by these things, mind you, but they didn’t determine our votes.What mattered — and matters — to us was policy. Hillary Clinton offered clear, specific, and timely policy proposals to expand the social safety net and civil rights of people with disabilities, while Trump made clear his intent to slash services and roll back legal protections. For the millions of Americans with disabilities who depend on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act to access the health care and public services that mean basic survival, it is policy — not personal insult — that has brought terror and despair in the aftermath of last night’s Trump victory.It’s hard to know what a Trump presidency will bring, given our new president-elect’s penchant for playing fast and loose with the details of public policy. At no point during the election did Trump issue anything resembling the comprehensive white papers offered by the Clinton campaign on issues like autism, Alzheimer’s, mental health policy, and other segments of the disability community.Yet the Trump campaign did put forward a number of specific commitments relevant to disability, scattered throughout the candidate’s statements and his health care policy platform. With the man now about to become the leader of the free world, it’s worth looking at the impact Trump’s policies would have on Americans with disabilities (should he follow through).The vast majority of disability services are paid for by the Medicaid program, the state-federal partnership best known for its role in providing health care for low-income Americans. In 2014, Medicaid spent approximately $151.8 billion on support services for seniors and people with disabilities — 53 percent of which was spent to keep those receiving support in their own homes rather than in nursing homes or institutions.These services are a lifeline for people with disabilities, seniors, and their families. They can mean the difference between life or death — or the difference of a family member needing to quit her job to provide uncompensated care. Over the past 20 years, federal officials and advocates have worked together to promote community integration and in-home care for those receiving support, inspired by a 1999 Supreme Court decision that ruled that disabled Americans have a right to receive care outside of the segregated environments of nursing homes and institutions. To encourage states to expand in-home care, the federal government has offered carrots and sticks — from increases in the allotted federal match for state expenditures on such services to civil rights enforcement from the Department of Justice.Unfortunately, Trump has proposed to block-grant Medicaid in his health policy platform. Such a measure would fundamentally change the nature of the program. Today, Medicaid matches each dollar spent by a state government with a dollar from the federal government — sometimes several times that, for states with higher percentages of low-income residents. Under a block-grant, states would simply receive a lump sum for Medicaid, with no additional funds should they expand their commitment and no real ability for advocates to use federal incentives to push for freeing seniors and people with disabilities from institutions and other segregated settings.Block-granting Medicaid would also drastically reduce funding to the program over the coming decade. Assuming Trump intends to pursue a similar block-grant proposal to the one advanced by House Republicans this past year, block-granting would slash federal Medicaid funding by as much as $1 trillion between 2017 and 2026. By the 10-year mark, federal funding would stand at only two-thirds of its current level, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Not only would this effectively doom the chances of the hundreds of thousands of disabled adults now on waiting lists for in-home supports, but it would likely result in considerable service cutbacks to those now receiving care.It’s frightening to think of how this could play out. Under the current system, Medicaid is an open-ended commitment — federal financing is guaranteed, and in exchange, states must provide care to all who are eligible. If block-granting proceeds, it would enable state officials to kick disabled adults and children out of life-preserving services for reasons of budget constraints, pressure from influential providers seeking to promote other business models, or any reason at all. Under a block grant, disabled Americans might effectively lack any rights to support services under federal law.Block-granting has long been on the GOP’s policy wish list. With Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, this is one wish Trump finally has the power to deliver.Of course, President Trump will be able to finally accomplish the Republican Party’s most heartfelt desire: repealing (and hypothetically replacing) the Affordable Care Act. For the low-income Americans who depend on the ACA’s insurance subsidies or Medicaid expansion for affordable coverage, this will be a disaster. For Americans with disabilities who depend on the law’s end to preexisting condition discrimination, it will be an unprecedented loss of both health care and civil rights.When the Americans With Disabilities Act passed in 1990, advocates were forced to compromise and continue to allow disability discrimination in one particular arena: health insurance. At the time, the economics of health insurance were such that ending “medical underwriting” — the practice of charging more or denying coverage based on a disability or other preexisting condition — would collapse the industry. It was only with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act and its individual mandate that eliminating disability discrimination in insurance became feasible. In that sense, the Affordable Care Act completed the nondiscrimination requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, more than two decades later.With President Trump committed to eliminating the ACA and the individual mandate that allows for an end to preexisting condition discrimination, it seems inevitable that millions of disabled Americans will once again lack meaningful access to the private insurance market. As someone who had planned to get coverage from the ACA’s marketplaces this coming year, the potential loss of these protections fills me with concern.Trump has also shown signs of affinity with the growing movement among congressional Republicans to weaken the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy rights of people with mental illness. His website’s health policy platform references “promising reforms” to enable family members to access their relatives’ mental health records — a likely reference to Rep. Tim Murphy’s (R-PA) ongoing efforts to weaken HIPAA privacy protections, expand forced treatment, and hog-tie legal aid organizations funded to serve people with psychiatric disabilities.Motivated by a desire to show congressional action after high-profile mass shootings, a number of GOP politicians have supported legislation that would drastically limit the degree to which people with mental health conditions could limit private medical information flowing to family members. As with so many other areas, mental health policy under President Trump is likely to grow more coercive, with little to no concern for the rights of those most vulnerable.Trump has not been shy about his support for the thoroughly discredited idea that autism is caused by vaccinations. As early as the second GOP primary debate, Trump linked autism to vaccines, going on to spout the long discredited idea that “autism has become an epidemic. … Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.”Of course, this is not true — not only has the autism-vaccine link been shown to be false, but a growing body of scientific evidence shows that autistic people have always existed in approximately the same proportion of the general population, rather than constituting a recent epidemic. But while Trump’s comments on autism have little scientific legitimacy, they have tremendous political relevance.Over the past 10 years, federal autism policy has witnessed a sea change. As autistic self-advocates (those of us who are autistic ourselves) began to play a bigger role in autism policymaking, discussion began on the need to shift from an overwhelming emphasis on causation, biology, and cure to promoting new investments in services, educational methodologies, and assistive technology.Many policymakers took note of the objection from large segments of the autistic community to attempting to “cure” autism, hearing our preference to instead focus on improving the opportunity for autistic people to develop skills and lead successful lives as autistic adults. At the behest of advocates like me, Congress changed the nation’s premier autism statute from the Combating Autism Act to the Autism CARES Act, denoting a shift toward a greater emphasis on services rather than trying to make autistic people look and act “normal.”It’s long been clear to autistic activists that Trump is aligned with the most reactionary forces in the autism community, who would prefer that none of these changes take place. He enjoyed endorsements relatively early in the cycle from prominent anti-vaccine activists who adamantly oppose recent shifts toward a more progressive autism policy. Bob Wright, the founder of the powerful and often reviled Autism Speaks charity (who is known for his own anti-vaccine leanings), tweeted his enthusiastic support in April. Now that Trump is poised to take the presidency, he will likely turn to these early allies to fill key roles in his administration relevant to autism and disability. The potential outcomes are frightening.In 1981, the newly sworn-in Reagan administration came to Washington with the stated goal of eliminating pesky federal regulation — and new disability rights laws were squarely within its crosshairs. After a failed attempt to repeal the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (which guaranteed children with disabilities the right to access public schools for the first time), the Reagan administration moved to weaken the law through regulation. A massive backlash ensued, led by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund’s Pat Wright and the Disability Rights Center’s Evan Kemp Jr. The ultimate result: More than 40,000 cards and letters from disabled people and family members sent to the White House. Shortly afterward, the Reagan administration backed off trying to change special education law. It would not try again.Another effort by Reagan to remove people from the rolls of the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program was more successful — for a time. In 1981, the Reagan administration ordered a review of more than 1 million SSDI cases, prompted by concerns that the program had grown from a $3.1 billion to a $15.5 billion price tag between 1970 and 1980.Again, disability advocates mobilized en masse, with advocacy groups and friendly members of Congress publicizing suicides due to disabled people losing their benefits and calling attention to the relatively cavalier approach undertaken by the Reagan-era Social Security Administration (by 1987, 63 percent of the 315,910 removed from benefits were determined to be improperly denied and had their cash payment under the program restored).Subsequent class-action litigation won beneficiaries the right to appeal and reapply for benefits after a federal judge ruled that the government had inappropriately removed from benefits individuals who had no change in the severity of their disability. By 1983, advocates had successfully pushed through a law ensuring that disabled beneficiaries could keep their benefits while appeals were underway — with Reagan pulling back on further efforts to purge the program and paying lip service to “truly deserving” disabled people.Just as 1980s disability advocates successfully defeated Reagan’s attempted rollback of federal disability programs, the current generation has the opportunity to do the same to President Trump.Still, I won’t pretend that the aftermath of the 2016 election isn’t leaving people with disabilities feeling like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football before Lucy pulls it out from under him. It’s galling to face the prospect of President Trump in the same year that brought landmark advances in the visibility and priority placed on disability rights. In the space of a few hours, we went from planning how to make sure President Clinton lives up to her campaign promises to planning a desperate fight to make sure President Trump does not live up to his.And yet, as in all such things, there is opportunity in disaster. Our imminent Trump presidency is likely to be a calamity for a broad swath of Americans — and liberal and progressive activists will respond by seeking to attack Trump on every front available. For a disability rights movement that’s often seen as the orphan stepchild of progressive advocacy, there’s a chance to better integrate disability into the liberal pantheon of diversity, identity, and protected class. By better highlighting how disabled Americans will almost certainly suffer under Trump policies, disability activists can familiarize the advocates and policymakers who will form the nucleus of the next Democratic administration with our needs and our values.Just like the George W. Bush administration’s crusade against same-sex marriage helped to normalize the role of the LGBTQ movement under the civil rights umbrella (and within the Democratic Party’s political coalition), it may very well be that disability rights activists will achieve greater solidarity from other progressive groups after four years of shared opposition to the outrages of President Trump. Compared with the potentially game-changing strides forward promised by the Clinton campaign, this is cold comfort — but it is something we can cling to as we prepare for the fights to come. With the lives of millions of Americans with disabilities at stake — as well as those of people of color, Jews, Muslims, low-income persons, LGBTQ Americans, and members of other marginalized groups — we need all the silver lining we can find. The next four years will be difficult ones.Ari Ne’eman is the president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and served as one of President Obama’s appointees to the National Council on Disability from 2010 to 2015.First Person is Vox's home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

In response, he held his arm in a claw-like position while addressing the rally.“Now the poor guy. You ought to see the guy: ‘Err, I don’t know what I said. I don’t remember,’” Trump said, waving his arms around.“He’s going: ‘I don’t remember. Maybe that’s what I said.’”The whole thing lasted just a few seconds, but it sparked global outrage, with accusations Mr Trump was impersonating and making fun of the reporter’s disability.Kovaleski said Mr Trump’s antics did not surprise him.“The sad part about it is, it didn’t in the slightest bit jar or surprise me that Donald Trump would do something this low-rent, given his track record,” he told the Washington Post.The New York Times rebuked Mr Trump in a statement, saying: “We think it’s outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.”Mr Trump has repeatedly been forced to deny the campaign ever since.In the immediate aftermath, he tweeted that he was “showing a person groveling”.Likewise when his opponent Hillary Clinton released a campaign ad alluding to the incident, Mr Trump posted a fresh tweet denying what happened.But the incident was never forgotten.During the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Ms Clinton said: “He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.”Following Streep’s speech, the President-elect has once again been forced to defend himself.“I was never mocking anyone,” Trump told the Times yesterday. “I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story. People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.”Likewise, his senior adviser Kellyanne Conway has gone into damage-control mode.“You can’t give him the benefit of the doubt on this, and he’s telling you what was in his heart?” she asked CNN anchor Chris Cuomo.“It’s a gesture that he’s making on video,” he replied. “Everyone can see it.”Watch the video above and judge for yourself.",http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/golden-globes/this-is-the-moment-donald-trump-mocked-a-disabled-journalist/news-story/d920020f91dfaa857a07cfa25cec24b5,

Videos could back him up,"Donald Trump, it turns out, is not very good at impressions -- but that could be his alibi against persistent accusations that he mocked a reporter's disability last fall.Trump’s spastic arm waving at a rally last November while mimicking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski drew swift condemnation from opponents who claimed Trump was making light of a disability. It's followed him ever since. The Washington Post gave Trump four Pinocchio’s for his denials, and Hillary Clinton used a clip of the impression in a video released Tuesday slamming Trump.But a pro-Trump, Catholic website has compiled footage appearing to show Trump has a very limited repertoire of impressions -- which the site points to as evidence he wasn't mocking the reporter's disability.View the video above to see a compilation of Trump's impressions.Catholics 4 Trump posted four videos – one of which dates back to 2005 – in which Trump impersonates everyone from Sen. Ted Cruz to The Donald himself with the same, flailing mannerisms and goofy speech.At a February rally in South Carolina, Trump deployed the impression style to mock Cruz's answer to a question about waterboarding that was posed during an earlier debate. With a panicked look on his face and his hands flapping about, Trump stammered Oh, I don't wanna talk about it!Trump also used the arm-thrashing act when making fun of himself during an interview with Larry King in 2005; when imitating a bank president in October; and when mocking an Army general at the same November speech in which he made the original Kovaleski comments.Kovaleski suffers from a joint abnormality. Trump immediately denied making fun of Kovaleski’s handicap after he was called out for it.I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovalski [sic] is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence, Trump said in a November statement.Kovaleski countered that he and Trump had met at least a dozen times and the two were on a first-name basis when Kovaleski was a reporter at The New York Daily News covering Trump in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Trump disputes this.Few pundits and political analysts bought the explanation about his November comments, especially when Trump in July claimed he was only imitating the reporter groveling.“Trump now suggests he was just imitating a grovel, but that’s not what he was actually doing,” Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote in August.Trump had started talking about Kovaleski at the 2015 rally because he was defending himself from another controversial statement – that he had seen “thousands” of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Trump’s supporters had cited an article Kovaleski wrote around the time as evidence that Trump was correct. That article said “a number of people” had been seen celebrating. So when Kovaleski rebutted Trump, saying he never saw “thousands” or “hundreds” celebrating, Trump railed against the reporter – and one controversy begat another.“All of a sudden, I get reports that I was imitating a reporter who was handicapped,” Trump said in July. “I would never do that.”",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/14/did-trump-really-mock-reporters-disability-videos-could-back-him-up.html,
Donald Trump mocked someone with a disability.,http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,,I’m a Woman with a Disability who Voted for Donald Trump. Here’s Why...,"My whole life I have cast off the labels and stereotypes others foisted upon me. Thus, politics-by-category annoys me. Unfortunately, in the 2016 presidential election cycle, America seemed convinced by the narrative that the winner could be predicted by the number of voters who fit into the categories embodied by the two major candidates. The thinking went: Since most voters are women, of course Hillary Clinton would be the next President. Conventional wisdom also held that a white conservative newcomer couldn’t possibly beat a liberal who appealed to a wide swath of minority voters.I’ve always been rather difficult to categorize. Born with a disability, it took until very recently for doctors to truly nail down a diagnosis. It changed with the evolution of medical technology from Cerebral palsy to congenital neurological malformation with hydrocephalus to, finally, spina bifida with hydrocephalus. But I’ve always felt and analyzed things deeply. While I flirted briefly in college with supporting certain Democratic candidates, I’ve always considered myself a conservative Republican. One of my earliest childhood memories is of dictating a letter to my father to be sent to President Nixon about something that my four-year-old self felt needed discussing.The assumption that I was going to vote for Hillary Clinton just because she is a woman amused me. The assumption that I couldn’t possibly vote for Donald Trump because I have a disability infuriated me. No one ever thought to ask me what my principles were. They looked at my packaging and assumed because of my gender, my last name (I married into a fully assimilated Latino family) and my disability.Part of that assumption was because of Trump’s mocking of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has arthrogryposis, in November 2015, which I didn’t like at all—and the lack of accessibility at campaign events, which I didn’t like either. But I didn’t let those factors cloud my judgment. Yes, I’ve been mocked before, too. Although hurtful, it’s helped me grow a really thick skin—and realize that some people don’t understand how such things come off. When given a chance to do so discreetly, I’ve addressed mockers and tried to help them understand that behaving in such a way isn’t the best approach when in an uncomfortable situation. I’ve seen that people who’ve acted like Trump did that day can change, especially when they come to know someone with a disability.Besides, the election cycle began for me months earlier, with Senator Ted Cruz’s announcement in March 2015. I remained heavily involved as a professional volunteer (in that my expenses were paid for, but I made no money) with his campaign until he suspended it in May of 2016, when a path to the nomination became unattainable. After his suspension, well-meaning friends urged me to jump aboard the Trump Train. I didn’t immediately make up my mind. For me, it was a loyalty issue. Could I support someone who had so stringently opposed the candidate of my choice and who was as different from him personally as one could be?I wrestled with what my vote would be, especially in light of the binary choice between conservativism and liberalism that Sen. Cruz reminded us of when he announced Trump would receive his vote. The tipping point came for me in a conversation with Dr. Charmaine Yoest, who reminded me that policy must always come before personality in the same way that we choose to respect the Office of the Presidency, rather than the person occupying it.There was my answer. The principles of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee align most closely with the principles by which I live my life. This includes his plans to cut the Affordable Care Act. I don’t believe it is the government’s job to provide health insurance—and having a disability isn’t the main guiding force in the way I think about how I want my government run. I want the smallest possible federal structure with states and communities allowed to function as they were intended: to care for their own, disabled or not.I’d already spent the last eight years gritting my teeth and choosing to respect the Office of the Presidency even though the principles of the man occupying the office—his love for big government, his belief that America should apologize at all, his social liberalism that says my convictions shouldn’t guide my business interactions—made me want to poke my eyes out with a dull stick. There was no way I was going to do anything that would remotely allow a similar scenario for another four or eight years.When the time came, I happily voted for Trump and Mike Pence. I have no regrets. I did what I had to do to reduce the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming the next President and furthering the practices and policies that have so damaged our republic over the last eight years. Fortunately, we instead have an opportunity to chart a whole new wonderful direction for all Americans. Principles matter. I voted for the policies I believe are best for all Americans, including those with disabilities: limited government, three equal branches that include a non-activist Supreme Court and laws that protect innocent life from conception until natural death.I don’t vote with my womanhood or my wheelchair. I vote with my head guided by my heart.",http://time.com/4620974/disabled-donald-trump-vote/,

It is awful & worthy of criticism and commentary but it is far from the worst thing Trump said or did during his campaign and quite frankly the obsession with putting it forward as the quintessential example of how horrible Trump is, is deeply hypocritical.",The Problem With Paternalizing Disabled People to Protest Donald Trump,"More than a week after the 2016 US election many people are still in shock at the result. People are still trying to piece together how Donald trump won and at the same time voice their horror at his election. This is entirely understandable considering the bigotry that was the backbone of Trump’s campaign which included suggesting that undocumented Mexican immigrants were rapists and that the US should build a wall on the Mexican border & the suggestion that the US should implement a total shutdown of Muslim immigration into the country.Criticisms of Trump and his use of this sort of rhetoric absolutely should be criticized and protested. Particularly because these things could be acted upon and be used to harm the people being targeted.I however genuinely wish that I could stop seeing things like thisimage description: A screenshot of a tweet by Damien Owens including an image of Donald Trump physically mocking disabled reporter Serge Kovaleski with the text “As long as I live, I will never understand how this alone wasn’t the end of it” (link to original tweet)This tweet has been retweeted over 100 000 times and I originally can across it when the screenshot was shared on Facebook. This incident is considered by many to be Trump’s worst moment of the campaign.Things like this make me feel sick and it’s not even the fact that I am repeatedly forced to see that image of Trump (horrific as it is). It infuriates me because it comes not from an understanding of what a Trump presidency will actually mean for disabled people in the United States but from pure paternalism.Trump mocking Kovaleski is undeniably ableist. It is awful & worthy of criticism and commentary but it is far from the worst thing Trump said or did during his campaign and quite frankly the obsession with putting it forward as the quintessential example of how horrible Trump is, is deeply hypocritical.First, let’s remember why Trump was mocking Kovaleski in the first place. He was angry that Kovaleski pushed back against Trump’s exaggerated interpretation of an article that Kovaleski had written about reports that Muslims were seen celebrating on 9/11.The mockery of Kovaleski completely overshadowed the fact that Trump was in fact trying to fan the flames of Islamophobia at the time. He was doing that because he had already called for a registry of Muslims. First question, why wasn’t declaring a registry for an entire religious group not big enough of a horror to be the last straw? Second question, why is the mocking of an individual (even if that mockery is grounded in bigotry) worse than the Islamophobia Trump was defending and the actual suggestion of registering Muslims,  an action that if taken would hurt millions?Mocking Kovaleski was bad but it wasn’t a suggestion of action against disabled people, even Trump knew enough to deny that he was mocking Kovaleski’s disability. He knew better than to double down on that. An awareness that he did not extend to the other groups that he targeted and included suggestions on how he might actually hurt them like mass deportations and building a wall.That is not to say that Trump’s policies are good for disabled people, they’re not. He’s threatening the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and disabled people are very worried about what a Trump presidency will mean for them. However, simply holding up Trump’s mockery of Serge Kovaleski doesn’t help them. It doesn’t acknowledge how gutting the Affordable Care Act will hurt disabled people. It does not show Trump’s track record of dealing with disability issues (like that his properties have been sued at least 8 times for ADA violations).It does not come with an active call of solidarity for disabled people with demands for greater access and ACA protection or plans on how to help disabled people when Trump implements harmful laws.It doesn’t do those things because it isn’t actually based in the idea that disabled people are fully human. It’s based in the idea that disabled people are perpetual children who require coddling and protection. We are not people to be worked with but to be heroically saved.This kind of focus also ignores the double standard of lambasting Trump for his ableism but ignoring the ableism used against the Trump campaign.Apparently, Trump mocking Serge Kovaleski is beyond the pale but the widespread and concerted efforts to label Trump with a hypothetical mental illness were righteous and in no way totally stigmatizing of people with psychiatric disabilities.Right Wing pundit Ann Coulter defended Trump by claiming he wasn’t mocking Kovaleski’s specific disability but was rather “he was just doing an impression of a ‘standard retard'”. As much as I hate to agree with Coulter in any way, particularly when she’s doing her level best to normalize slurs against people with intellectual disabilities, she may well be right. It is all to common to attempt to discredit someone by suggesting they are like someone with an intellectual disability. Trump was even the target of such associations.During the campaign I came across images like this,Image description: A side by side image labeled “The Goonies Now” it shows then and now photos of the cast of the 1985 film The Goonies until the final comparison which shows a picture of the character Sloth who has an intellectual disability and facial disfigurement, it is shown next to a photoshopped image of Trump who has been changed to feature the same disfigurement.Associating people with disability, particularly intellectual disability to discredit them is very common but the hypocrisy of focusing on the Kovaleski incident goes beyond that. It completely ignores the social reality of being disabled and that those realities were created or maintained by both political parties and extend beyond the borders of the United States.Consider the fact that as soon as it became clear that Trump was going to win; a post that I had written back in April on disability and immigration to Canada started getting a lot of traffic. It actually maintained the top viewed item spot on my blog for over a week.  If you don’t have time to read it it boils down to: if you’re disabled you can’t immigrate to Canada unless you marry a Canadian.The British government is currently under fire from the UN for violating the rights of disabled people with austerity measures. The government has more or less dismissed these concerns.Socially on an international level it is entirely acceptable to treat disabled people like second class citizens. None of this reality is addressed by focusing on that one time Trump mocked a single disabled person. Lambasting just the mockery suggests that the world is supposed to be above treating disabled people badly but the lived experience of disabled people does not bear this out.By simply suggesting the world should be above mocking disabled people without contextualizing it with the harms of ableist actions and policies, people are in fact covering up the fact that those things are widespread realities.If the concern was a genuine concern for disabled people then the question wouldn’t be “why didn’t Trump’s mocking of a disabled person stop his campaign in its tracks?” but rather “Why didn’t ads like this one for Hillary Clinton which affirms the humanity of disabled people and the importance of inclusion guarantee her the presidency?”The reality is that people are all to permissive of policies and laws that discriminate against disabled people regardless of political affiliation and fixing those problems or even acknowledging their scope is harder than calling Trump out for a single incidence of ableism.",https://crippledscholar.com/2016/11/19/the-problem-with-paternalizing-disabled-people-to-protest-donald-trump/,

On Thursday, content with what he was thankful for (himself), Trump tweeted a long statement lashing out at both Kovaleski (whose name he misspelled) and the Times and demanding that they apologize to him.“I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovalski [sic] is, what he looks like, or his level of intelligence. I don’t know if he is J.J. Watt or Muhammad Ali in his prime—or somebody of less athletic or physical ability,” Trump said in a statement to The Washington Post that vehemently denied that he mocked the reporter, who suffers from a muscoskeletal disorder that impacts his arms. “Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.”Speaking to the Times’s Maggie Haberman, Kovaleski described a history of interactions with Trump that went back decades: “He met with Mr. Trump repeatedly when he was a reporter for The Daily News. ... ‘Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years. I’ve interviewed him in his office. I’ve talked to him at press conferences. All in all, I would say around a dozen times, I’ve interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News.” So either Trump’s “all-time great” memory is at fault here or he was, in fact, purposefully mocking Kovaleski’s disability.

My name is Brooks Fitts, and I’m a 19-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina.North Carolina is shaping up to be a battleground state this year, and its electoral votes could make or break a candidate. This upcoming presidential election will be my first time voting, and as I cast my ballot, I will have one very distinct image on my mind. The image of you mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski for his disability, and then refusing to apologize for it.I was born with cerebral palsy, a disability which makes my hamstrings tight, and causes me to walk with a slight limp. Growing up with cerebral palsy was hard, as I often felt like the outsider and was frequently cast aside because of my differences.However, I’ve grown to be thankful for my cerebral palsy. Not because it has made it harder to walk, but because it’s helped build my character. In a world where emphasis is too often placed on the physical, my cerebral palsy has taught me it’s what’s on the inside that truly matters.So when you were up on stage and mocked Mr. Kovaleski for his disability, you mocked me. You not only mocked me, you mocked the nearly 53 million Americans who live with a disability. Americans who make contributions, Americans who love their country, and Americans who will show up to the polls this November.I am writing this letter to you on behalf of every American who lives with a disability, and requesting an apology. Regardless of whether you apologize for what you did or not, I hope you at least recognize that your actions were wrong. You are running to be the President of every American — those with disabilities, and those without.I would encourage you to spend a day with someone who lives with a disability.

Unfortunately, crude mocking of a news reporter’s disability isn’t really what we were looking for.",Mocking Trump – Center for Disability Rights,"Well, we wanted the Presidential candidates to say something about disability, and Donald Trump generously obliged us. Unfortunately, crude mocking of a news reporter’s disability isn’t really what we were looking for.Or, maybe it is. Maybe we can still get something out of this … um … incident, in addition to disgust and cheap amusement.Before I go on, I should probably state my personal opinion on two key points. First, I don’t like Donald Trump as a Presidential candidate. I didn’t like him before this incident and I don’t like him any better afterwards. So, I can’t claim total objectivity. Second, I am 80% sure that Trump was making fun of reporter Serge Kovaleski’s disability while talking about him at a rally last Tuesday. I think the odds are roughly 50% / 50% that Trump did it intentionally or that it was a spontaneous move.I am at least a bit uncertain here because: A. I am not a mind reader, and B. I think it’s possible Trump got carried away in the moment and used a somewhat generic form of mockery, something like a universal pantomime for, “this is what a stupid, weak, pathetic person is like.” In fact, when I first saw the headline, I thought someone might be jumping to conclusions and over-interpreting something tasteless but not targeted. Then I watched the video. That mostly changed my mind. What Trump is doing there is much too specific to be just a vague sort of goofiness. I think Trump spiced up his attack on Kovaleski’s journalistic credibility by mocking his appearance. Assuming that’s more or less what happened, then, what does it mean?First of all, we now know about another group of Americans Donald Trump is willing to insult when it suits him… disabled people. We are in good company of course, along with Hispanics, black people, Muslims, and women. And there may be more added to the list before next November. Any disabled people who still insist that disability issues have nothing to do with discrimination against other minorities should think again, because plenty of others already put us all in the same basket.By actually counterattacking Kovaleski for daring to contradict him, Trump also reminds us that as disabled people, we are part of “PC culture” whether we like it or not. All we have to do is complain once, decide on one rough day that we’re not going to just laugh off another remark or gesture that makes us cringe, and we become one of the whiners and weaklings who can’t take a joke, who shamefully “use” our disabilities to “grandstand” and make billionaire presidential candidates look bad.It’s worth pointing out here that Mr. Kovaleski has mainly confined his comments to the original issue … what did or didn’t happen in New Jersey right after 9/11, and whether or not he and Trump have ever been personally acquainted. It’s his employer, the New York Times, that originally went after Trump, and as far as I know, Mr. Kovaleski hasn’t mentioned his disability at all. That doesn’t matter, because the popular narrative is that disabled people who speak out in ways that make others uncomfortable are distasteful attention hogs.Trump’s mockery has also been a fine lesson in ad hominem attack … a particularly weak, childish form of argument where you attack superficial aspects of the person instead of their position. Whether or not he meant it and whether or not it was harmful, Trump called attention to irrelevant aspects of Serge Kovaleski’s appearance to discredit him on something completely unrelated. He’s not only wrong about this thing here … but he moves and talks funny!Ironically … or maybe appropriately … Trump later pointed out that he, himself, is often the target of similar attacks, based on his odd hairstyle. Making fun of Donald Trump’s hair isn’t quite as cruel or as resonant for an entire group of people as mocking a disability, but it’s just as weak an argument. Trump’s appearance and personal style are the least of his faults, and it does bother me when people focus on how he looks instead of on what he says and does.There are other hopeful signs coming out of this. Trump usually leans way into his harshest statements. This time, he’s at least trying to slide out of it sideways. He eventually felt it necessary to go out of his way to praise disabled people in general, and affirm that it’s generally not okay to mock people for their disability. The story may not be over yet, and Trump hasn’t really backed down, but making fun of a disabled person … even just appearing to do so … may turn out to be a step too far, even for him.Another interesting aspect of this story is the varied tone of the response. I can’t cite a thorough tally of news and social media coverage, but from the start, I got the impression that while plenty of disabled people are upset about Trump’s mockery, the most intense anger comes from nondisabled people. It’s almost as if disabled people themselves are unsurprised and, therefore, less impressed, because we have all experienced similar taunting.. That’s one of the reasons why I tend to believe Trump did what people think he did. I’ve had disabilities all my life … arthrogryposis in fact, though the type doesn’t matter … and I’ve seen this kind of thing before, from cartoon villains, but also from smart, kind people who should definitely know better. The main difference with Trump is that candidates for President are usually more polite and restrained about it.What frustrates me more is that personal offense and flashy individual outrage about disability always seem to generate more attention than dry, complex, but supremely important disability policy issues. I don’t mean to minimize the potential offensiveness of Trump’s actions at the podium, or his reactions afterwards. It’s just that I am much more interested in what Trump, and the other candidates of any party, want to actually do about our low employment rates, institutionalization, discrimination, lack of physical access, and still outdated approaches to education of disabled kids. But those are boring policy wonk topics requiring, you know, knowledge, empathy, and an attention span.Then on Saturday, Trump opened a door for real discussion, though in this case I don’t think he meant to do so. After reassuring the crowd in Florida that he would never really taunt disabled people, he said that he’s spent more money than anyone else on behalf of disabled people. By which he mainly means paying for all of his company buildings to be accessible. Now there’s a real-life, substantive disability policy issue … the importance of accessibility and what role the government should take in improving it. The next Republican debate is on December 15. Maybe an enterprising panelist will ask Trump and the other candidates about their views on the Americans with Disabilities Act and accessibility compliance. A discussion like that would be equally helpful at the next Democratic debate, on December 19, too.How about using this whole Thanksgiving Weekend brouhaha to kick off an even broader discussion of accessibility, the ADA, and … since Serge Kovaleski in many ways fits the ideal of a productive, gainfully employed disabled person … how they would help more disabled people reach their employment goals?I am completely serious. A debate moderator could easily use the Trump mockery incident to ask such a question. I have one piece of advice though. Require the candidates to leave out any defenses, apologies, or condemnations about the incident itself, and insist that they for once address real questions about disability, and not this hot but empty trivia.It might make the whole sorry spectacle worthwhile.Andrew Pulrang maintains the Disability Thinking blog, and worked in Independent Living for over 23 years at the North Country Center for Independence in Plattsburgh, New York.",http://cdrnys.org/blog/disability-politics/mocking-trump/,

President Trump said it in a Thursday speech in West Virginia, and House Speaker Paul Ryan mentions it a lot.The claim: The U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.The short answer: That is generally true, though many businesses end up paying far less than the statutory rate.The long answer: The U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate at least among advanced economies. Compared with nations in the OECD — the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of highly developed countries — the U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate in the world. The top corporate tax rate in the U.S., a combination of federal and state and local taxes, is nearly 39 percent this year. That's well above most other OECD nations.Trump would like to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and Ryan has reportedly said that 20 percent to 25 percent is more realistic. Either way, doing so would pull the U.S. well away from the top of this list.Anyway: The mostly in the mostly true here comes from the fact that a couple of other places beat out the U.S., outside of OECD countries. According to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the U.S. comes in third out of 188, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. (Tax Foundation's list includes some U.S. territories.)However, it's not quite that simple. Those rates above are the statutory rates — the rates set by law. And that is not the rate that many companies in the U.S. end up paying. Deductions and credits help push down businesses' total tax liability, meaning that many companies end up paying far less than the statutory rate. Here is the average effective tax rate for U.S. corporations.The U.S. is still toward the top of the spectrum, but it's nowhere near the ultra-high level (relative to other countries) that the statutory rate is at.When many politicians talk about overhauling the tax code, both on the corporate and income side, they talk about this discrepancy between effective rates and statutory rates — the phrase often used is broaden the base, lower the rates (or some configuration thereof). The idea is to lower the statutory rates but close some of the loopholes that push those effective rates so far from the statutory rates.One other way to put corporate tax rates in perspective: the total size of corporate revenue. That has fallen off over time.And on this measure, U.S. corporate taxation isn't all that big compared with other countries'. As of 2014, U.S. corporate tax revenues were at around 2.2 percent of the GDP. The OECD average was 2.8 percent.Likewise, the share of government revenue as a whole that comes from corporations has fallen off over time, a fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders highlighted on the presidential campaign trail — the idea being that the government has grown less reliant on corporate tax revenue.There are a number of factors at play here. The top corporate tax rate has been lowered over the years, for example; in the late 1960s, it was as high as 52.8 percent.But it's also true that over time, businesses have increasingly paid taxes through the income tax code, as the Tax Foundation points out. C-corporations pay corporate taxes, but S-corporations, also known as pass-through entities, pay through the individual income tax code. S-corporations include many small businesses run by middle-class Americans, but some very wealthy Americans, including Trump, also own S-corporations, as the New York Times pointed out this spring.All this jargon has been important to the tax overhaul fight already, as Republicans have considered imposing a cap on pass-through income. That is — the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent is the top rate an S-corporation might pay. Trump has floated a 15 percent cap on pass-through income, which would cut taxes for some S-corporations massively. But this plan has been heavily criticized, with opponents saying it would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and encourage people to reconfigure their businesses to avoid paying taxes.",https://www.npr.org/2017/08/07/541797699/fact-check-does-the-u-s-have-the-highest-corporate-tax-rate-in-the-world,

He's wrong.,"President Donald Trump began his sales job for wide-ranging tax cuts Wednesday by arguing that the US needs to shrink its corporate tax rate if it wants to have any hope of competing with its economic rivals.“When it comes to the business tax we are dead last, can you believe that?” Trump said during his remarks in Springfield, Missouri. “We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries.But what he doesn’t note is that while on paper the US business tax rate is exceptionally high, in practice the US taxes its businesses at similar rates to its international peers. And so Trump’s dire warnings about the need to lower the business tax code is really part of an effort to push through a gift to American corporations rather than make a serious bid to catch up to the rest of the world.During his remarks, Trump referred to the US’s 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate. He said that the rate, which is technically one of the highest in the world, suffocates American businesses and compels them to ship jobs overseas.But that’s inaccurate on a number of levels.“It’s a bit misleading because our corporate tax code is riddled with loopholes and what corporations pay is far, far lower — somewhere between 13 and 21 percent,” Hunter Blair, a tax and budget analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told me.“When you get down to specific companies, sometimes they pay 3, 4, 5 percent,” he added.According to a 2017 Congressional Budget Office report, the US’s effective corporate tax rate — the rate that factors in these loopholes — clocks in at 18.6 percent. That’s lower than in Japan (21.7 percent) and the UK (18.7 percent) and only a few percentage points higher than Germany (15.5 percent).Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center, told me that the loopholes are so pervasive that the formal rate is “irrelevant.”“When you take into account the loopholes in US tax code, our [business] taxes are pretty much the same as our competitors,” Rosenthal said.Big multinational corporations commonly make use of the deferral loophole, which allows them to avoid taxes on profits made abroad.That exception creates incentives for corporations to use accounting gimmicks to shift profits made at home to overseas subsidiaries and to funnel money through foreign tax havens where they owe little to no tax.According to a 2017 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Fortune 500 companies are dodging up to $767 billion in US federal income taxes by keeping more than $2.6 trillion of their profits offshore.Trump also charges that the US’s stifling corporate tax rate is to blame for jobs being shipped overseas. He said other countries “made their taxes lower — and far lower in many cases than ours — and jobs left our country.”But that’s a crude simplification of why corporations move their operations abroad, which happens for plenty of other reasons, like cheaper labor costs.“Tax rates are only a small piece of the factors that determine where a company locates,” Rosenthal said. “[Other factors are] educated work force, infrastructure, rule of law. To highlight taxes in isolation is misleading.”Instead of trying to lower the corporate tax code, Trump should consider closing the loopholes that allow them to sidestep the rate at which they’re actually supposed to be taxed. Right now, corporations, which are making record profits, are doing just fine.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16228766/trump-us-corporate-business-tax-reform-world,

Comparatively, the average tax rate of the 202 jurisdictions surveyed is 22.96 percent,[3] or 29.41 percent weighted by GDP.[4]The twenty countries with the highest statutory corporate income tax rates span every region, albeit unequally. While seven of the top twenty countries are located in Africa, Europe and Asia appear in the top twenty only twice each. Of the remaining jurisdictions, three are located in Oceania, and six are located in the Americas.Several jurisdictions on the list are United States territories. Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands rank second, tenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth respectively. Taken together, the United States indirectly accounts for a quarter of the twenty jurisdictions with the highest statutory corporate tax rates.The only other countries with large economies in the top twenty are India (34.61 percent) and France (34.43 percent), which rank near the bottom of the category. India holds the eighteenth spot, while France holds the twentieth.On the other end of the spectrum, the twenty countries with the lowest non-zero statutory corporate tax rates all charge rates lower than 15 percent. Ten countries have statutory rates of 10 percent, six being small European nations (Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Gibraltar, Kosovo, and Macedonia). The only two major industrialized nations[5] represented among the bottom twenty countries are Ireland and Hungary. Ireland is known for its low 12.5 percent rate, which has been in place since 2003. Hungary dropped into the bottom twenty for the first time in 2017 after reducing its corporate income tax rate from 19 percent to 9 percent.Of the 202 jurisdictions surveyed, fourteen currently do not impose a general corporate income tax. Most of these countries are small, island nations. A handful, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, are well-known for their lack of corporate taxes. Bahrain has no general corporate income tax, but has a targeted corporate income tax on oil companies.[6]Corporate tax rates can vary significantly by region. Africa has the highest average statutory tax rate among all regions, at 28.73 percent. Europe has the lowest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions, at 18.35 percent.When weighted by GDP, North America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate at 37.01 percent. Although many low tax jurisdictions are located in this region, the United States accounts for more than 82 percent of regional GDP so its comparatively high rate has a significant impact on the regional average. Europe has the lowest weighted average statutory corporate income tax, with a rate of 25.58 percent.In general, larger and more industrialized nations tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than smaller or less developed nations. These rates are usually above the worldwide average. The G7, which is comprised of the seven wealthiest nations in the world, has an average statutory corporate income tax rate of 29.57 percent, and a weighted average rate of 33.48 percent. OECD member states have an average statutory corporate tax rate of 24.18 percent and a rate of 31.12 when weighted by GDP. The BRICS[7] have an average statutory rate of 28.32 percent and a weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate of 27.34 percent.Very few tax jurisdictions impose a corporate income tax at statutory rates greater than 35 percent. The following chart shows a distribution of corporate income tax rates among 202 jurisdictions in 2017. A plurality of countries (92 total) impose a rate between 20 and 30 percent. Thirty countries have a statutory corporate tax rate between 30 and 35 percent. The United States is among only five countries to have a statutory corporate income tax rate exceeding 35 percent. Seventy-five countries have a statutory corporate tax rate lower than 20 percent and 167 countries have a corporate tax below 30 percent.Over the past 37 years, the corporate tax rate has consistently declined on a global basis.[8] In 1980, the unweighted average worldwide statutory tax rate was 38.68 percent. Today, the average statutory rate stands at 22.96 percent, representing a 41 percent reduction over the 37 years surveyed.The weighted average statutory rate has remained higher than the simple average over this period. The United States is largely responsible for keeping the weighted average so high, given its relatively high tax rate across all years, as well as its significant contribution to global GDP. Regardless, the weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate has declined from 46.64 percent in 1980 to 29.41 percent in 2017, representing a 37 percent reduction over the 37 years surveyed.Unlike the rest of the world, the United States has maintained a relatively stable corporate rate for the last several decades. The only major rate change occurred as part of the 1986 tax reforms. The reforms reduced the federal statutory rate from 46 percent in 1986 to 40 percent in 1987, before further reducing the rate to 34 percent in 1988. The rate would later be raised to 35 percent in 1993, where it remains today.Over time, more countries have shifted to taxing corporations at rates lower than 30 percent. This changing distribution of corporate tax rates has been far from consistent. The largest shift occurred between 2000 and 2010, with 77 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2010 and only 42 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2000.All regions saw a net decline in average statutory rates between 1980 and 2017. The average declined the most in Europe, with the 1980 average of 40.5 percent dropping to 18.35 percent, representing almost a 55 percent rate reduction. South America has seen the smallest decline, with the average only decreasing by 28 percent from 39.66 percent in 1980 to 28.73 percent in 2017.Africa, Oceania, and South America all saw periods where the average statutory rate increased, although the average rates decreased in all regions over the full period. In each instance of an average rate increase, the change was relatively small, with the absolute change being less than 1 percentage-point between decades.The last time the United States reduced its federal corporate income tax rate was in 1986. Since then, countries throughout the world have significantly reduced their statutory tax rates. Today, the United States statutory corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world and stands well above the worldwide average. Reducing the statutory corporate tax rate to around the worldwide average as part of tax reform could discourage profit shifting and encourage companies to locate investment in the United States.[2] The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven separate emirates. Since 1960, each emirate has the discretion to levy up to a 55 percent corporate tax rate on any business. In practice, this tax is mostly levied on foreign banks and petroleum companies.

Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.",Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world?,"The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.Pundits don’t just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are.On Fox News’s The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama.America has the most number of deductions available to corporations, Beckel said. They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much.Just to fact-check you a little bit, responded Bolling, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called tax inversion.They’re going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax, said Bolling.We separately checked Beckel’s claim about deductions, but in this check, we’ll see whether Bolling is correct that the United States’ corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world.We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, . That fits our bill for a proxy for the free world.Out of the 34 countries in the OECD , America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is what’s called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits.According to the , two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we don’t think they would fit into the free world category Bolling used.PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the mostly qualifier is that companies aren’t actually taxed at the statutory rate.Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate.But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay.The most recent estimate comes from the , which put the United States’ effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall.Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent.Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is, said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don’t normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time.Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying.Many studies also don’t account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said.So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses’ burden may vary.Bolling said the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, he’s right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States’ corporate tax rate doesn’t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.",http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/,

We're the highest taxed nation in the world, he said, according to NPR White House reporter Scott Horsley. People want to see massive tax cuts.In September, the President made the same assertion via Twitter in order to make the case for tax reform. We are the highest taxed nation in the world — that will change, he wrote.At a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, this summer, Trump again said that, in America, we have the highest taxes in the world.In reality, the United States has average or below average taxes compared to similar economies.The Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking site Politifact.com calls the president's assertion, which he has been making for a couple of years now, one of his most repeated falsehoods.Regardless of how you measure the tax burden, the president's claim is not borne out by the facts. As measured by percentage of GDP, numerous European countries that provide more social services tax their citizens more heavily than the U.S. does, the BBC reports: In 2015, the U.S. tax take came in at 26.4 percent of GDP, well below countries such as Italy at 43.3 percent, France at 45.5 percent and Denmark at 46.6 percent.You can see this reflected in a chart by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in 2016, which uses slightly different numbers. By their calculations, Denmark comes in at over 50 percent. But the U.S. remains steady at 26 percent, significantly below the average of 34 percent.As such, America is actually among the lowest-taxed countries in the OECD.

U.S. vs. Europe, Developed Countries","As the Republicans in Washington prepare to dig into the coming round of budget negotiations, their top priorities will include an systemic overhaul for U.S. taxes, which President Trump has characterized as “just about the highest in the world.”But how much do Americans really pay compared with other nations? It may be less than you think.A research paper published this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago includes the above chart, highlighting the tax burdens of all 35 OECD countries as of 2014. With a tax burden of 25% — a measurement that includes income, property, and various other taxes — the U.S. is near the very bottom, well below the overall average of 34%. It ranks below all the measured countries except Korea, Chile, and Mexico.Trump and other Republicans are right about one aspect of U.S. taxes, however. When it comes to taxing corporate profits, the U.S. does indeed have one of the highest nominal maximum rates in the world, at 35%.The new study’s authors looked in particular at how the U.S. tax regime stacks up against Germany’s — a nation they chose because its economy resembles that of the U.S., and because Trump has said Germany’s trade surplus with the U.S gives it an upper hand economically.And U.S. corporations are in fact paying higher income taxes than German ones. As it happens, deductions and other tax strategies mean relatively few U.S. corporations actually get stuck paying the maximum nominal 35% rate, instead paying about 20% on average. But that is still higher than the comparable 15% effective rate that German corporations pay, according to the Chicago Fed estimates.The high U.S. nominal corporate tax rate could indeed be a problem for the economy, since it encourages U.S. corporations to shift their operations overseas to keep tax bills low — something Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly called out.All the same, those the federal corporate income tax represents a relative small part of the U.S. overall tax picture, according the Chicago Fed study — accounting for less than 10% of overall tax revenue.",http://time.com/money/4862673/us-tax-burden-vs-oecd-countries/,

It's not.,"On Wednesday, President Trump twice said the United States is ""the highest taxed nation in the world."" No, it's not. In fact, Trump has made the very same blanket claim at least 18 times before, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Here are just a few ways the United States trails other countries in terms of taxation. Total revenue collected The United States in 2015 collected $14,794 per capita in tax revenue, according to data from the OECD, which is a group of 34 democracies with market economies. That's well below what many other OECD members collected. Luxembourg took the top spot, with $42,655 collected per person. Norway came in second, collecting $30,140. As a share of the economy, the U.S. collected 26.4% of its gross domestic product in total revenue, well below the 34.3% OECD average. By that measure, Denmark takes the top spot at 46.6%. Individual taxes Many other economies impose a top income tax rate -- factoring in both the national and local tax bite -- that's well above the highest combined individual income tax rate in the United States. And often the top rate in other economies hit people much lower down the income scale than those paying the highest tax rate in the United States. For example, in 2012, the highest U.S. combined rate was 44% and it applied to income over $400,000. But in Denmark, the top rate was 60% and applied to income over $55,000. What's more, once tax breaks are taken into account, the federal income tax burden on average Americans is lower than most expect. The majority of Americans effectively pay less than 15% of their total income in federal taxes. And close to 40% end up with zero income tax liability every year. Corporate taxes Among countries and tax jurisdictions worldwide, the U.S. corporate tax rate ranks third, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, according to the Tax Foundation. Trump is on firmer ground when he says -- as he did Wednesday -- that the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest ""in the developed world."" The top U.S. corporate rate is 35%. When combined with state and local business taxes, it's just over 39% on average. That's higher than the average statutory rates of countries in the OECD. It's also higher than that of the 15 largest economies in the world, according to the Congressional Research Service. But that doesn't tell the whole story. Corporate tax revenue only accounts for about 2.2% of U.S. GDP, which is below the OECD average. And as percent of total taxes collected, the U.S. has been roughly on par with the OECD average in recent years. In terms of actual tax burden, the Government Accountability Office found that once various tax breaks are taken into account, large profitable U.S. companies paid, on average, about 14% of their pretax income in taxes in 2012 -- or 22% once foreign, state and local taxes are included. And about a fifth of those companies owed no U.S. taxes at all. One factor that can contribute to a company's zero tax liability is if it has foreign profits that it leaves overseas, because under the current system U.S. tax can be deferred on offshore earnings until that money is repatriated. Still, calls to lower the U.S. corporate rate are widespread because so many other countries that compete with the United States for business have lowered their statutory rates. ""Our high marginal tax rates distort incentives, but we have so many tax breaks in our code, the high rate doesn't translate to paying more overall in taxes. It mainly means we collect our taxes in a highly-complex and often inefficient manner, which is why there is so much we can do to improve our tax code,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas has noted.",http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/06/news/economy/united-states-is-not-highest-taxed-in-world/index.html,

Trump's plan to cut it to 15% would tie the US for the fourth lowest.But other data shows that the situation is a bit more complex.According to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, when taking out various deductions and tax breaks for corporations, the US ranked fourth among G-20 countries in effective corporate tax rates — what countries actually pay.Meanwhile, the US's all-in personal income tax rate for a single person at the average wage with no children is 16th among OECD countries, at 26%. If a couple has two children, that drops to 25th.Even looking at the top marginal tax rate for the highest-income earners, the US ranks in the middle of the pack among OECD countries, with the 18th-highest marginal statutory rate.But the most comprehensive measure by which to judge Trump's claim, combining corporate and individual taxes paid, is tax burden as a percentage of gross domestic product. It compares how much money in a country is put toward taxes with the economic output of the country.By this measure, the US has the fourth-lowest tax burden of any OECD country, with only South Korea, Chile, and Mexico ranking lower.",http://www.businessinsider.com/is-us-highest-taxed-country-like-trump-claims-2017-9,

In 2015, US taxes at all levels of government represented 26 percent of GDP, compared with an average of 34 percent of GDP for the 34 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Among OECD countries, only Korea, Chile, Mexico, and Ireland collected less than the United States as a percentage of GDP. In many European countries, taxes exceeded 40 percent of GDP. But those countries generally provide more extensive government services than the United States does. COMPOSITION OF TAX REVENUE Income and Profits Taxes:Taxes on personal income and business profits made up 49 percent of US tax revenue in 2015, a higher percentage than in most other OECD countries, where such taxes averaged 34 percent of the total (figure 2). Australia, Denmark, and New Zealand topped the United States in this category, generating over half of their total revenue from such taxes. In the United States, personal income taxes alone generated 40 percent of total tax revenue compared with 24 percent on average within the OECD.   Social Security Contributions: The United States collects relatively less revenue dedicated to retirement, disability, and other social security programs—24 percent of total tax revenue—than the 26 percent OECD average. Some countries were well above that average: the Slovak and Czech Republics, Slovenia and Japan all collected 40 percent or more of their revenue from that source. Property Taxes: Property taxes provided almost twice as large a share of US tax revenue—10 percent in 2015—than the OECD average of 6 percent. Almost all revenue from taxes on property in the United States is collected by state and local governments. Goods and Services Taxes: The United States relies less on taxes on goods and services (including both general consumption taxes and taxes on specific goods and services) than any other OECD country, collecting 17 percent of tax revenue this way compared with 32 percent for the OECD. The value-added tax (VAT)—a type of general consumption tax collected in stages—is the main source of consumption tax revenue, employed worldwide in 160 countries including all 34 OECD member countries except the United States.

President Trump has argued that the U.S. rate is among the world’s highest and makes U.S. companies “uncompetitive.” These comparisons are misleading. Rather than focusing on the top statutory rate, they should focus on what companies actually pay. And they should focus on large, high-income countries, which companies likely view as similar to the United States as potential places to locate and invest in for non-tax reasons. After accounting for tax breaks and loopholes, U.S. corporate rates are well below the 35 percent top statutory rate and are in line with corporate rates in similar countries. The Treasury Office of Tax Analysis estimates:[1] The average corporate tax rate on profits from new investments made in the U.S. is 24 percent; the average corporate rate on profits from new investments made by companies in other “Group of Seven” (G-7) industrialized, democratic countries, weighted by the size of their economies, is 21 percent. This measure of tax rates is useful when considering how corporate taxes affect companies’ decisions about where to make new investments. The share of worldwide profits that U.S. multinational corporations pay in U.S. and foreign income taxes is about 28 percent; the average for companies headquartered in other G-7 countries, weighted by the size of their economies, is 29 percent. This measure of tax rates that a multinational might face on its income from all countries is useful for considering how corporate taxes might affect where multinationals choose to reside for tax purposes. (See chart.) Actual U.S. Corporate Tax Rates Far Lower than Statutory Rate, In Line With Comparable Countries The Statutory Rate Isn’t an Appropriate Comparison Comparisons of corporate tax rates should focus on the measures that reflect what companies actually pay, not the top statutory rate. Proponents of slashing the corporate tax rate often note the U.S. statutory tax rate is the highest among developed countries. But many U.S. companies use an array of targeted tax breaks and loopholes to significantly lower the taxes they pay. These include tax subsidies for certain types of investments (such as in research and development) and for particular industries (such as oil and gas). The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2016, while the corporate income tax raised $300 billion in revenues, targeted subsidies delivered to companies through the corporate tax code cost about $270 billion. As a result of these subsidies and other tax avoidance measures, many large U.S. companies pay very low rates. For example, Pfizer paid a rate of about 7.5 percent on its $12 billion in worldwide pre-tax income in 2014. Studies generally also find that U.S. companies’ tax rates vary widely by industry and type of investment. Comparisons Should Be Made With Similar Countries Comparisons of corporate tax rates should focus on large, high-income countries, and should take into account the size of the countries’ economies when calculating international averages: Large, high-income countries such as the G-7 are likely to be most similar to the United States in terms of their public infrastructure, the workforce’s education and skills, and political structure and stability. These factors are what make these countries attractive places for companies to locate in and invest, regardless of their tax rates. By contrast, a developing country with an economic output per person that’s a fraction of the size of the United States and with much lower public investments is not a fair comparison. As the non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) explains, “If tax rates are not weighted, then a small economy, such as Iceland, can have the same effect on the average of international rates as a large economy, such as Germany or Japan,” and, “Because small countries tend to have lower rates than large ones, comparing rates using simple averages across countries exaggerates the differential between the United States and tax burdens elsewhere in the world.” The CRS examined studies that compare U.S. tax rates with those of other countries — including those commonly cited as showing that even actual U.S. corporate tax rates are high by international standards. The CRS found that most of the difference between the actual U.S. corporate rate and the international average disappears when using appropriate countries and weights. A Treasury study (discussed above) came to a similar conclusion. Corporate Rate Cuts a Poor Way to Grow the Economy The erroneous international comparisons of corporate tax rates are often coupled with arguments that cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate would help create jobs and growth. In fact: The case for slashing corporate tax rates is thin: U.S. companies are posting near-record profits, and little suggests that corporate taxes — or poor corporate profitability — are a major constraint for the U.S. economy. Most of the benefit of corporate rate cuts flows to high-income investors rather than “trickling down” to workers in the form of higher wages, and the cuts are costly: Reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, as President Trump has proposed, would cost more than $2 trillion over ten years. Such a tax cut could hurt the majority of Americans if it permanently increased deficits (which can slow economic growth in the long run, according to the Congressional Budget Office) or its high cost is paid for with large cuts to investments that help working families.[2] Rather than slashing the corporate tax rate, true corporate tax reform that addressed inefficient corporate tax breaks, loopholes, and the tilt of the tax code towards debt and foreign profits would be more likely to foster growth. Such reform could help investments flow to where they are most productive. It could also raise revenues to reduce deficits and invest in national priorities like education and infrastructure, benefitting the economy and most Americans.",https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/actual-us-corporate-tax-rates-are-in-line-with-comparable-countries,

The marginal corporate tax rate in the United States is 35% at the federal level and 39.2% once state taxes are accounted for, according to the 2013 OECD Tax Database. The global average is much lower, at 25%. Switzerland enjoys the lowest national rate, at 8.5%, but its rate increases to 21.1% after factoring in local taxes, giving Ireland the lowest overall rate, at 12.5%. The high tax rate on U.S. corporations, combined with worldwide taxation, impacts American businesses in several ways - some would argue, negatively.The U.S. government taxes the income U.S. corporations earn not just domestically but abroad as well. Since firms also pay taxes on profits earned abroad to those countries’ governments, U.S. corporations pay a double tax on foreign-earned income. Most developed countries don’t use this system; they use a territorial tax system. If the United States used a territorial system, U.S.-based firms would give Uncle Sam a cut only of profits earned here. Not only is this double tax a burden on corporations in and of itself, it also puts them at a disadvantage compared with foreign competitors who are not subject to the double tax. (To find out about what some corporations are doing to get around this issue, see Overseas Cash Hoards: Shareholder Boon or Taxpayer Burden?)“The high corporate income tax rate puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage versus lower-taxed nations like Ireland and Canada in the effort to attract new corporate investment and jobs,” says John Boyd, Jr., principal of The Boyd Company, a Princeton, N.J.-based firm that counsels major corporations on where to locate their facilities and invest globally.One result is the relocation of U.S. corporations to foreign countries with more favorable tax laws. When these companies move their headquarters or create foreign subsidiaries, jobs and profits move overseas. The number of U.S. jobs at major multinational corporations shrunk during the last decade by 2.9 million, even more than the 2.4 million jobs these companies created abroad. In 2009, about one-third of all these companies’ workers were located abroad. And U.S. companies were holding $1.95 trillion in foreign countries in 2013, according to calculations by Bloomberg News. When you can choose where to do business, it makes sense to choose the lowest-cost option, and many corporations do.Because tax rates and corporate tax deductions and credits have such a significant impact on corporations’ bottom lines, lobbying politicians to change or maintain the tax code in ways that benefit corporations becomes a valuable use of corporate income. If corporate taxes were not such a burden, companies could instead spend lobbying dollars on developing new products and services and increasing sales. Not only do corporations lose, their customers lose as well, because these products and services either take longer to get to market or never make it there at all. And despite the United States’ high tax rate, economists project that lowering the rate would actually increase tax revenue because corporations could dedicate more resources to taxable, profit-generating activities.About 10% of federal revenue comes from corporate taxes; the rest comes from payroll taxes (34%), income taxes (47%), and excise, estate and other taxes (9%). The share of federal revenue attributable to the corporate tax was close to 40% in 1945 and has hovered around today’s level since the 1980s. Individuals have paid an increasing share of total taxes in recent decades, as corporations have paid a decreasing share, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a public policy organization focused on budget and tax policies. This increase is mostly in the form of the payroll tax.“One big issue I have with high corporate taxes is that they encourage business owners to spend instead of save for the future,” says Jeff Kear, owner of Planning Pod, a comprehensive, online event-management application. The way the corporate tax code is structured, he explains, “if you spend your revenues in the current tax year on business-related expenses, you can effectively write many them off.”Saving and investing revenues so that more capital is available for future growth, or to sustain the business through hard times, would be the smarter decision for many businesses, but those saved and invested revenues incur more taxes. “High corporate taxes disincentivize corporate saving, which leads to more instability in the business world,” Kear says.It isn’t just corporations themselves that have noticed how the high corporate tax rate discourages saving and investment. The very government responsible for the rate acknowledges this flaw. So why haven’t they tried to correct it?Corporate tax reform efforts aim to repeal corporate tax credits and deductions, reduce the corporate tax rate and get companies to bring income from abroad back to the United States (called “repatriation”) without reducing overall federal tax revenue. Many of these proposals are unpopular with corporations, who are often major contributors to politicians’ election campaigns. These contributions give politicians an incentive to keep corporations happy, which frequently means maintaining the status quo. Politicians can’t agree on reforms, so little changes. The proposals are also unpopular with the entities reformers propose raising taxes on to keep total government revenue the same. These groups fight change as well.The 35% marginal tax rate on U.S. corporations discourages U.S. companies from earning profits domestically, which sends jobs and taxable income overseas. It gives businesses an incentive to spend now instead of saving and investing for the future, even when the latter might be the more prudent choice. It also wastes corporate resources that could be spent on developing new products and services and instead redirects those resources toward lobbying politicians for favorable changes in the corporate tax code or for maintaining the status quo. Because the tax code is so complex, it is difficult to reform it in ways that make everyone better off. Instead, numerous reform proposals never pass because of different interest groups’ conflicting incentives.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/051614/do-us-high-corporate-tax-rates-hurt-americans.asp,

""The United States statutory corporate income tax rate is 15.92 percentage points higher than the worldwide average, and 9.5 percentage points higher than the worldwide average weighted by gross domestic product,"" the report states. ""The worldwide corporate tax rate has declined significantly since 1980 from an average of 38 percent to 22.96 percent."" According to the Tax Foundation, while the rest of the world has reduced their statutory tax rate, the United States has kept one of the highest rates in the world. The last time the United States cut the corporate tax rate was in 1986. The Tax Foundation says cutting the corporate tax rate again would encourage companies to move their investments back to this country. President Trump, along with two congressional committees, introduced their tax reform proposal last week, which would reduce this rate to 20 percent. ""We will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for the American worker,"" said Trump last week at an event for manufacturers. ""When it comes to business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations. We have the highest tax of any nation in the world—our rate is the least competitive rate."" ""It is time to go from dead last to pretty much the front of the pack,"" Trump said. ""We will dramatically cut our business tax rate so that American companies and workers can compete with our foreign competitors. This is a revolutionary change and the biggest winners will be everyday working families as jobs start pouring into our country."" Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, testified at the Joint Economic Committee hearing yesterday and explained what happens to entrepreneurs when they are making decisions about their business in relation to the tax code. Hodge brought up an example of Maria, an entrepreneur who has created a smart scooter that she wants to incorporate into personal transportation. ""If she chooses to become a C-corporation and becomes successful enough, she will eventually face one of the highest corporate taxes in the industrialized world—35 percent at the federal level and nearly 39 percent when we add in the average state rate,"" Hodge said. ""Although it is missing some key details, the recently released tax reform framework does propose a number of policies that will improve the tax code for entrepreneurs."" ""The most dramatic of these changes are the significantly lower tax rates for C-corporations and pass-through businesses,"" he said. ""The framework proposes a 20 percent tax rate for C-corporations and a top tax rate of 25 percent for pass-through business income."" ""You should aim to get the tax code out of the way of entrepreneurs by making it simpler, less burdensome, and eliminating its antigrowth biases,"" Hodge said to lawmakers.

However, it is less well known how the United States stacks up against countries throughout the entire world,” observed Kyle Pomerleauan, Economist for the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy.While the US corporate tax rate has remained static over the last decade, with Congress unable to agree on competitiveness-enhacing tax reform, most other countries have been cutting corporate tax, leaving America with one of the highest rates in the world. The Tax Foundation says that the US tax rate is now 16 percent higher than the worldwide average of 22.8 percent and a little more than nine percentage points higher than the worldwide GDP-weighted average of 29.8 percent.Somewhat surprisingly, the region with the lowest average corporate tax rate is Europe, at 18.7 percent (26.1 percent weighted by GDP). In Europe, nine countries have top corporate tax rates of just 10 percent. Africa has the highest simple average, at 28.77 percent.Larger, more industrialized countries tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than developing countries, and the United States is joined by France (34.4 percent), Brazil (34 percent), and India (34 percent) in the top-twenty.Pomerleauan concluded: “The corporate income tax rate is one of many aspects of what makes a country’s tax code and economy attractive for investment. However, as the rest of the world’s economies mature and their tax rates on corporate income continue to decline, the United States risks losing its competitive edge due to its exceptionally high corporate income tax rate.”",https://www.irslogics.com/news/worlds-third-highest-corporate-tax-rate/,

It should be noted that most American corporations don’t pay the full 40% rate. Why? Clever tax accountants find ways to reduce the burden through legal loopholes and by parking money overseas in low tax rate nations.The U.S. however, is not alone in having lofty corporate tax rates. Below we list the top corporate tax rates among major economies around the world, as compiled by the consultancy KPMG (you can see the full list here). Is it merely a coincidence that, with the exception of the U.S., the countries with the highest corporate tax rates are struggling economically?America has the highest corporate tax rate in the world among major economies. Its top rate of 40% has encouraged a number of companies to “invert.” In an inversion, a U.S. company buys a foreign subsidiary and moves its headquarters (on paper, at least) to that country to enjoy a lower tax rate—a practice that Fortune has called positively un-American. Japan’s economy has struggled for decades with deflation and slow growth. As part of the country’s broad revival strategy, dubbed “Abenomics” after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan plans to cut the corporate tax rate to below 30%. The first rate reductions will be made in fiscal year 2015. Although Argentina’s government reported some positive statistics in the most recent quarter, the nation’s lofty 35% corporate tax rate can’t be helping its struggling economy get back on track. High taxes combined with a free-falling peso and a chronic debt dispute with global creditors only increase the pressure on companies operating in Latin America’s third-largest economy. The GDP of this nation of 189 million is growing 4.2% annually. Security, however, remains fragile as Pakistan plays a strategic role in the West’s confrontation with Islamist terror groups. The country will need to attract investors through privatization and regulatory reform, which would include, one hopes, its high corporate tax rate. A high corporate tax rate is the least of Venezuela’s problems. The South American nation has the highest inflation rate in the world at 64%.

(In comparison, France has a tax rate of 33.33 percent and Portugal has 21 percent.)",The Myth of America's High Corporate Taxes,"One of the many reasons that the phrase President Donald Trump exists is that he campaigned to change the fact that America is the highest taxed country in the world.On the campaign trail, Trump promised lowering corporate taxes, which he said would promote economic development—instead of paying money to the government, he reasoned, corporations would invest it back into production or wages. Never mind that a 2016 study by Brookings found that the net impact on growth [after lowering taxes] is uncertain, but many estimates suggest it is either small or negative—the gripe that American taxes are too high is a perennially popular one among constituents.But is the United States actually the highest taxed country in the world for businesses? This is where things get nice and murky.Currently, the official statutory corporate tax rate in the U.S.—that is, the legally imposed percentage of income that corporations are instructed to pay the government—is 35 percent. That's the highest official rate in the world, and Trump wants to cut it to 15 percent. However, as a new report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows, that 35 percent is not at all the actual tax rate the government is collecting from major corporations.The study examined 258 companies that, between 2008 and 2015, were on the Fortune 500 list and were continually profitable. They found that, rather than the 35 percent rate owed, these companies paid an average of only 21.2 percent, a rate that is below-average compared to the statutory corporate tax rates of other developed countries in the world. (In comparison, France has a tax rate of 33.33 percent and Portugal has 21 percent.)Why the near 14-point discrepancy? The study finds that major companies aren't doing anything overtly illegal: Instead, they are taking advantage of the many different ways embedded in the U.S. tax system that allow corporations to keep money from being collected. Tax avoidance—when one party arranges their financial affairs to pay the least possible taxes within the law—is precisely that: lawful.We put a lot of the blame on Congress, says Richard Phillips, a senior policy analyst for ITEP and one of the authors of the study. We think Congress can end all this tax avoidance tomorrow if they wanted, they just need to close loopholes and tax breaks.Thirty of the 258 companies paid between zero and 10 percent during the eight years studied, while 18 others paid less than zero percent. The study highlights that it's not all of corporate America avoiding 25 percent or more in taxes: Retail and health-care companies, for instance, were more likely to pay close to the 35 percent rate, as they are physically beholden to the border constraints that befall purely domestic companies. Multinational corporations, on the other hand, can try to keep as much revenue as they can—as businesses do—by creating accounts in tax havens like Ireland or the Cayman Islands.This is called offshoring, and it allowed the top 50 U.S. companies to keep $1.4 trillion away from taxes in 2014, according to a 2016 study by Oxfam. (Apple held the most money offshore, at $181 billion.) These companies tend to pay more taxes, percentage-wise, to foreign governments than to the U.S.; of the 107 companies that collected more than 10 percent of their worldwide income abroad, 62 paid higher foreign tax rates on that income than the rate they paid to the U.S. on their domestic income.While offshoring is the loophole most often exploited by major corporations, according to Phillips, there are other ways for profitable companies to drastically cut the U.S.'s 35 percent rate on their own. Corporations can do everything from filing executive stock options as costs to lower their tax burden to utilizing accelerated depreciation, where companies can deduct the cost of assets at a faster rate than their value actually decreases (a common tactic used by utilities corporations). Or, they may simply have the luck (or lobbyist power) to get Congress to issue an industry-specific subsidy or tax break.Big corporations simply have a lot of resources that they can devote to tax minimization, James Spindler, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, writes in an email. Most corporations play by the rules, but they are better at it than we are.Because none of these tactics are illegal, experts say the only real solution is changing the rules of how the corporate taxing procedure works. But the likelihood of accomplishing this—a daunting task under the Obama administration, now ideologically opposed to the current team in the White House—seems low. [Fixing these loopholes] is the hard part of corporate tax reform, and this Congress seems far more intent on doing the easy part, which is cutting the statutory rate, Richard Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut Law School, writes. The report offers a broad road-map to reform, and it's a map our elected officials aren't consulting.That doesn't mean lawmakers and policymakers haven't offered solutions: Fixing the loophole of accelerated depreciation could mean simply changing to a straight-line depreciation model, according to the non-profit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Senator Eric Brakey (R-Maine) has proposed eliminating tax credits to reduce tax breaks for specific industries. The offshore tax haven problem is a little trickier, but may involve taxing at the point of consumption, not production.But how likely are any of these solutions to be implemented? To pay attention to the current rhetoric coming out of the White House the answer is a solid not realistic. Now's probably a good time to remind everyone that the county's highest-elected official, in a nationally televised presidential debate, claimed that not paying his taxes made him smart.",https://psmag.com/economics/that-35-percent-rate-is-deceptive,

The chart below has a selection of them.In 2015, the US tax take came in at 26.4% of GDP, well below countries such as Italy at 43.3%, France at 45.5% and Denmark at 46.6%.So, for overall tax, the US is certainly not the highest.It may be that President Trump was referring to specific taxes.Looking at taxes on individuals, Pew Research looked into tax levels in the US last year and considered the tax rates paid by various types of households with different levels of incomes.It found that US tax bills were below average for developed nations.For high earners, PriceWaterhouse Coopers did some research in 2014, which looked at the G20 countries, and found that someone earning $400,000 (£240,000) in Italy would take home the smallest proportion of their earnings, with the US coming eighth on the list.For the 2017 tax year, the top rate of income tax was 39.6%, affecting single taxpayers whose income exceeds $418,400, or $470,700 for married taxpayers filing jointly.If you look at this list of top tax rates from KPMG, Sweden comes out on top at 61.85%.Turning to corporation tax, the corresponding list from KPMG does put the highest rate for the US at the top (that's 35% federal corporate income tax plus state taxes), with only the United Arab Emirates having a higher rate, which appears to be charged only to foreign oil companies.The US Congress also did a comparison, which found that the US had the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the G20, although looking at the levels companies were actually paying, the US was third on the list of average corporate tax rates and fourth on the list of effective corporate tax rates.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40728560,

Most corporate income is taxed at that rate. With state taxes added in, the top statutory rate is even higher; on average, that combined rate was 39.1 percent in 2012, among the highest in the world (see table below).The statutory corporate tax rate is one of many features of the tax system that influence corporate behavior. Companies are likely also to consider other provisions of the tax system—including tax preferences, surtaxes, and noncorporate taxes—that affect the amount of taxes they owe. Among the alternative measures of tax rates that account for some of those provisions are the average and effective marginal corporate tax rates.The average corporate tax rate is a measure of the total amount of corporate taxes that a company pays as a share of its income. CBO estimates that the U.S. average corporate tax rate for foreign-owned companies incorporated in the United States in 2012 was 29 percent—about 10 percentage points below the top U.S. statutory corporate tax rate.The effective marginal corporate tax rate (in this document, the effective corporate tax rate), is a measure of a corporation’s tax burden on returns from a marginal investment (one that is expected to earn just enough, after taxes, to attract investors). CBO estimates that the effective corporate tax rate was 19 percent in the United States in 2012. That rate, the fourth highest among the Group of 20 (G20) countries, was about 20 percentage points below the top U.S. statutory corporate tax rate.This chart book is an update and expansion of CBO’s 2005 report that examined statutory and effective corporate tax rates for the United States and member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of 7 between 1982 and 2003. This report focuses mainly on the 2012 tax rates in countries that are members of the G20. CBO expanded the analysis to include average tax rates, which were estimated on the basis of information reported for income and taxes paid by corporations in a given year. For both this report and the 2005 report, effective corporate tax rates were derived from simulations based on certain features of the various countries’ tax systems.The first section of the report reviews statutory corporate tax rates in the United States and elsewhere. The second covers average corporate tax rates. The third examines effective corporate tax rates and the factors that affect them. Appendix A details CBO’s analytical methods, and Appendix B describes some alternative approaches to test the sensitivity of CBO’s estimates of effective corporate tax rates.All three types of corporate tax rates affect a company’s decisions, but each influences a different choice. Because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company’s incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate. The average corporate tax rate reflects a country’s corporate tax rate schedule, the system’s tax preferences for business investments, any surtaxes, and possibilities for tax avoidance or evasion. Companies consider the average corporate tax rate when deciding whether to undertake a large or long-term investment in a particular country. The effective corporate tax rate, which is a measure of the tax on a marginal investment, is more informative for decisions about whether to expand ongoing projects in those countries in which a company already operates. In contrast, businesses focus on the narrower statutory corporate tax rate when they develop legal and accounting strategies to shift income earned in high-tax countries to low-tax jurisdictions—especially low-tax jurisdictions in which those businesses do not plan to invest and from which they thus expect no benefits from tax preferences for business investments.The top statutory corporate tax rate in the United States in 2012 was 10 percentage points higher than the average (weighted by gross domestic product, or GDP) of the top rates in the other G20 countries, CBO estimates. In 2003, Japan, Germany, and the United States had the highest statutory corporate tax rates among G20 countries; by 2012, reductions in Japan’s and Germany’s top rates had dropped them to second and ninth place, respectively, boosting the United States to the top of the list. The United States also had the highest rate among the 15 countries with GDP above $1 trillion in 2012, according to one survey of 129 jurisdictions.In countries outside the G20, tax rates varied more widely in 2012. On the one hand, the United Arab Emirates taxed corporate income at rates up to 55 percent. On the other hand, some jurisdictions had rates so low (and in some cases collected no corporate income taxes at all) that they were considered tax havens, attracting companies to relocate income from other countries with higher corporate income tax rates.A U.S.-owned foreign company is one that is incorporated outside the United States and has more than half of its shares (a controlling interest) owned by a single U.S. taxpayer. About 49,000 U.S.-owned companies were incorporated in G20 countries in 2012. CBO estimates that those companies faced average corporate tax rates in 2012 that were nearly always lower than the top statutory corporate tax rate in the country of incorporation. Two exceptions were Argentina and Indonesia, which had the G20 countries’ highest average corporate tax rates for U.S.-owned foreign companies. Average corporate tax rates in the G20 for those businesses ranged from a high of 37 percent in Argentina to a low of 10 percent in the United Kingdom—the G20 country with the greatest number of U.S.-owned foreign companies in 2012.In this report, CBO compares average corporate tax rates for U.S.-owned foreign companies with the rates faced by foreign-owned companies incorporated in the United States. Those businesses have more than half of their shares owned by a single foreign taxpayer. If it were possible to calculate, the best measure for comparing new investments in a foreign country with those in the United States would be the average tax rate faced by the U.S.-located affiliates of U.S.-owned foreign companies. That rate, however, cannot be calculated with available information. Instead, the average tax rate faced by foreign-owned companies incorporated in the United States is used as an approximation because both types of companies operate outside of their domestic markets. In 2012, the average tax rate faced by foreign-owned U.S. companies was higher than the average rates that U.S.-owned companies faced in all but two other G20 countries.Average corporate tax rates were lower in 2012 than they were in 2004 in the United States and eight other G20 countries, CBO estimates. Top statutory corporate tax rates fell in most G20 countries between those two years, but other changes in the tax system and the economy also affected average corporate tax rates.Two key features of national tax systems cause effective corporate tax rates to differ—both in magnitude and direction—from top statutory corporate tax rates: the treatment of depreciation (the loss in value attributable to wear and tear of an asset) and the sources of financing for investments. CBO estimates that, at 18.6 percent, the U.S. effective corporate tax rate in 2012 was more than 20 percentage points lower than the top statutory rate. Other tax preferences that are part of the U.S. tax code but that are not included in this analysis would lower that rate even more.The U.S. tax code provides companies with deductions for depreciation (known as cost recovery allowances) that are more generous for equipment than for buildings, although the opposite is true for most other G20 countries. As a result, the U.S. effective corporate rate on investments in equipment was only the 10th highest among G20 countries in 2012, but the effective corporate rate on investments in buildings was 2nd highest among the G20 countries.Because companies in most countries can deduct interest payments—but not payments of dividends to shareholders or the capital gains they earn—from taxable income, effective corporate tax rates on debt-financed investments are lower than are those for equity-financed investments. That difference is greater when there is a high statutory corporate tax rate because the high rate increases the value of the interest deduction. The value of that deduction, in combination with the depreciation schedule, caused the U.S. effective corporate tax rate for debt-financed investments in equipment to be the second lowest among G20 countries in 2012. The U.S. effective corporate tax rate is ranked near the middle for comparable equity-financed investments. Italy is unique among the G20 countries in that since 2012, its tax system has provided an allowance for corporate equity that permits companies to take a deduction for equity that is similar to the deduction for interest payments. That feature is the chief reason that Italy’s overall corporate effective tax rate was estimated to be negative in 2012.CBO estimates that the U.S. effective corporate tax rate overall was essentially unchanged between 2003 and 2012. In 2003, the U.S. rate ranked fifth among those of the G20 countries, and it followed Japan’s, Argentina’s, Canada’s, and Germany’s. In 2012, the U.S. rate ranked fourth, and it followed Argentina’s, Japan’s, and the United Kingdom’s. In Italy, largely because of the adoption of the allowance for corporate equity, the effective corporate tax rate declined by 36 percentage points from 2003 to 2012. By that year, Italy’s rate, at –23 percent, was by far the lowest among G20 countries and constituted a net government subsidy for corporations’ marginal investments.The estimates of effective corporate tax rates presented in this report reflect differences among the G20 countries only in statutory corporate tax rates and depreciation allowances for buildings and equipment. However, countries also differ in their tax treatment of other sources of income or expenditures (for example, investments in research and experimentation) and in their economic conditions (such as their inflation rates). Appendix B includes estimates that incorporate additional differences among the G20 countries. Accounting for those differences results in estimates for the United States that range from 13 percent (accounting for the tax treatment of investments in research and experimentation) to 19 percent (using the actual U.S. inflation rate in 2012).The necessary data are not available to estimate average corporate tax rates for a year more recent than 2012. It is possible, however, to examine how statutory and effective corporate tax rates have changed since 2012. Four G20 countries modified their corporate income tax systems after 2012, generally resulting in lower effective tax rates. Japan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom reduced their top statutory corporate tax rates. As of 2015, Japan’s top statutory corporate tax rate was 32.1 percent—5 percentage points lower than its top rate in 2012. As a result, CBO’s estimates of Japan’s effective corporate tax rate fell from 21.7 percent in 2012 to 18 percent in 2015. South Africa’s top statutory corporate tax rate fell from 34.6 percent in 2012 to 28 percent in 2015, and its estimated effective corporate tax rate fell from 9.0 percent in 2012 to 6.2 percent in 2015. The United Kingdom reduced its top statutory corporate tax rate from 24 percent in 2012 to 20 percent in 2015 but also slightly tightened the tax treatment of depreciation for equipment. On net, those changes led to a reduction in the estimates of effective corporate tax rates from 18.7 percent in 2012 to 15.7 percent in 2015. An increase in a surcharge caused India’s top statutory corporate tax rate to rise from 32.5 percent in 2012 to 34.6 percent in 2015. That change led to an increase in the estimates of the effective corporate tax rates from 13.6 percent in 2012 to 15 percent in 2015.",https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52419,

That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren’t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United States is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.The first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren’t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama’s claim that the economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.Looking at job growth over the course of the calendar yearWe looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found:So Obama’s on target: The job growth during calendar year 2014 was higher than any year going back to 1999.That said, the current recovery is hardly perfect.There have been three clear periods of job growth over the past quarter century. We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted.Here’s the breakdown of the three job expansions:This shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade.Obama said the economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. The current jobs recovery isn’t perfect, but Obama is correct that it’s the fastest since 1999. So we rate the claim True.",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/,

Employers added 321,000 jobs in November, helping average hourly earnings to their best gain in a year and a half.",Consumers Lift GDP Growth To Fastest Pace Since 2003,"The economy grew at its fastest rate in more than a decade during the third quarter, lifted by stronger spending from consumers, businesses and government. Some data out Tuesday underscored the choppy nature of the expansion but pointed firmly to economic momentum.GDP growth was revised up to an annualized 5% from an earlier reading of 3.9%, the Commerce Department said. It was the steepest gain since 2003 and solidly ahead of expectations. Separately, orders for long-lasting items sank 0.7% in November, defying expectations for a 3.1% increase and seeming to contradict other reports suggesting stronger industrial output.Sales of new homes also slid, touching an annual pace of 438,000 in November, down from a sharp, downward revision of 445,000 in October and below expectations for a stronger read of 460,000.Still, a revitalized consumer was on display in other data. Personal incomes rose 0.4% in November, better than in October, though less than analysts had forecast. Consumer spending rose 0.6%, better than expected and a solid increase from October's 0.3% gain.Consumer sentiment hit an 8-year high in the University of Michigan's final December read, with the gauge of expectations stronger than the measure of current conditions. Stocks surged on the news, with the Dow pushing past 18,000 for the first time.The takeaway is the consumer, said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors. If the consumers (are) going to lead the way, and they haven't been, they now are. They have the confidence, they're getting more money. That's really the story.The consumer sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, has lagged in the current expansion. Most economists and the Federal Reserve believe that deep-rooted challenges in the labor market kept wage gains too muted for consumers to feel confident about spending. Incomes barely kept pace with inflation over the past few years.But a solid jump in payrolls in 2014, which is on track to see the most jobs created since 1999, may finally change that formula. Employers added 321,000 jobs in November, helping average hourly earnings to their best gain in a year and a half.Consumers also have more money in their pockets, thanks to plunging oil prices. Average gas prices were $2.376 nationwide, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said Tuesday, down nearly a dollar from $3.25 a year ago.The steady decline in gas prices this autumn is now longer than any period AAA has previously tracked, the auto group said in a note on its website.Consumers view more discretionary income as simply a tax cut, University of Michigan survey directors noted, but called it no substitute for a widespread favorable job and income outlook.As the labor market and confidence firm further, Naroff believes, businesses will have no choice but to start boosting their own spending, which will help other segments of the economy like durable goods orders.I think you'll start seeing investment reflecting what the U.S. economy is looking like, rather than reflecting uncertainty about what the U.S. economy will look like, he said.Many economists believe that job market improvements will finally buoy the housing market. It should forge higher next year in response to a recent easing in bank lending standards, still-healthy affordability and falling joblessness, wrote Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a research note.",https://www.investors.com/news/economy/consumers-lift-gdp-at-fastest-pace-since-2003/,

More jobs were created in 2014 as a whole than in any year since 1999.",U.S. jobs growth hits fastest pace since 1997,"The economy cruised into the new year with a burst of fresh momentum, continuing to add jobs at the fastest pace since the boom of the late 1990s and lifting employment and wage prospects for millions of Americans left behind in a long but mostly lackluster recovery.The Labor Department said Friday that employers added a seasonally adjusted 257,000 jobs in January, but even more significant was a revision of earlier estimates showing an additional gain of 147,000 jobs in November and December.Since Nov. 1, employers have hired more than 1 million new workers, the best performance over a three-month period since 1997. More jobs were created in 2014 as a whole than in any year since 1999.“This is the best employment report we’ve had in a long time,” said Guy Berger, U.S. economist at RBS. “The labor market looks like it’s in really good shape as we head into 2015.”If the job market continues to gather strength into the run-up to the presidential election of 2016, as some forecasters now predict, the rebound promises to reshape the political landscape, as well as the economic one.Fierce Republican criticism of President Barack Obama’s economic policies, a touchstone of the 2012 presidential campaign, could resonate less with voters the next time around. Hillary Rodham Clinton or another potential Democratic nominee might have an easier time making the case for keeping the White House in Democratic hands.The key, say political experts from both parties, is how the bounty from renewed growth is shared and whether wages for middle-income workers rise more quickly, along with other yardsticks like overall economic activity and the stock market.On the wage front, the jury is still out. Last month, average hourly earnings rebounded after falling in December, increasing 2.2 percent for the last 12 months and suggesting that the benefits of a tighter job market could soon begin to spread more broadly to ordinary workers.But the major question after Friday’s report is whether better wage growth can be sustained.A few other caution signals are noticed as well. Data last week showed that economic output grew at a slower-than-expected 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2014.And Thursday, the government reported a big jump in the country’s trade deficit in December, as imports surged and exports fell. With the dollar gaining strength against the euro and other currencies, a rising trade imbalance may weigh on the economy in 2015.Nevertheless, even the one seemingly negative note in the January jobs report — an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent in December — was actually an encouraging sign, analysts said, since it was mostly caused by more jobless Americans looking for work again as labor demand heats up.The overall picture was so encouraging, experts said, that Federal Reserve policymakers may feel more comfortable starting their long-awaited move to raise short-term interest rates in June, a step Wall Street had generally expected to be delayed until September or even later.“Employment growth is astonishingly strong,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “With every indicator we follow screaming that payrolls will be very strong for the foreseeable future, wage pressures will intensify.”Others cautioned that the Fed would probably wait for more evidence that underlying inflation was picking up before deciding to pull the trigger.“This is a step in the right direction, but it is not a game changer for the Fed,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. “It takes away the concern that wages are decelerating, but we still have to see them accelerate.”Along with the generally positive tenor of the headline numbers, economists were also heartened by job gains in a broad variety of industries, both white collar and blue collar.For example, the construction industry, which is still suffering from the effects of the housing bust seven years ago, gained 39,000 jobs. Manufacturers added 22,000 workers, and restaurant and food service employment rose nearly 35,000.At the same time, higher-paid tiers of the economy also displayed strength. Financial companies and insurance providers hired more than 22,000 additional workers, and the booming health care field gained an additional 38,300.One notable weak spot was oil and gas extraction, as plunging energy prices prompted companies to lay off 1,900 workers, bringing total employment in the sector to 199,500. The public sector eliminated 10,000 jobs, including a 6,000 cut in employment by the federal government.“The good news is that there was hiring across a wide range,” said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University and chief economist at Indeed.com, a large job-posting site.“People worry about too many low-end jobs being created,” she said. “But we need those jobs, too.”",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2015/02/06/u.s.-jobs-growth-hits-fastest-pace-since-1997,
The economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/,True,True,True,True,True,True,"After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.",The Budget Message of the President – The Obama White House –,"To The Congress of The United States:After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and in 58 months we have created over 11 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the American people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has passed.With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other Nation on Earth. It’s now up to us to choose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs to a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Over the last six years, we’ve seen that middle-class economic works. We’ve reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules.The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not partisan. They’ll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax code, and immigration.First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the high costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum child care credit for middle-class families with young children, increasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care assistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four by the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four-year-olds.The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at work by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. It’s time to change that. For many families in today’s economy, having both parents in the workforce isn’t a luxury, it’s an economic necessity.Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have the chance to earn the skills and education they need to keep earning higher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and innovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early education for America’s youngest learners, provide more help to disadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare and support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all students graduate prepared for college and career.In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our efforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, two-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no American should be priced out of the education they need. Over the course of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the Budget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over time. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty percent of college students attend community college; some to learn a particular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time for two years of college to become as free and universal in America as high school is today.Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must work together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the Congress came together and passed important improvements to the Nation’s job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this Budget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers and double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful “learn-as-you-earn” approaches that our European counterparts use successfully by investing in the expansion of registered apprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are earning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer partnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer-validated credentials.As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget makes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped defend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our Nation’s veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing.Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment that helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to build on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where more than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America’s leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget funds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on the nine already funded through 2015. As part of the manufacturing initiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a public-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Budget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce the goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will help ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the future.Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge technology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other growing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting-edge advanced manufacturing research — to make sure we are leading the way in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; biomedical research — like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer’s, and Precision Medicine, which can improve health outcomes and better treat diseases; or, agricultural research—looking at climate resilience and sustainability. These investments have the potential to create high-wage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, resulting in sustainable economic growth.As our economy continues to grow, our Nation’s businesses and workers also need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy—modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and modernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit systems to link communities and support workers.These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise wages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the Budget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes that punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that keep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild our aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate inequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying any taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more young people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a small business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy.Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war spending, we’ve strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But we still face threats to our security that we must address.The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take time and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL.The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine’s democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies.We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to increasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I continue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to meet this evolving threat.The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by infectious diseases like Ebola — here at home, and internationally. It provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for States to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the Pacific—where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, resolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges we face.No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. Fourteen of our planet’s 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world’s best scientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal Government’s bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create Government liabilities. That’s why this Budget takes action on climate by supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with investments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the-ground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place strategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to support America’s leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal issue.Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my Management Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government’s buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work.The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Last year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not families; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and pass criminal and national security background checks to start paying their fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. I also took action to streamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, entrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for all American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first step toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should act on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can provide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It is time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform.The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to provide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre-existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has also helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care.This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America’s future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing America. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help America’s hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change.Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We’ve laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will help us begin this new chapter together.",https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse/the-budget-message-of-the-president-ac83b57308c6,

The performance helped to drive year-on-year expansion from 1.9 per cent to 2.1 per cent — the highest rate since the second quarter of 2011.Separate figures from a business survey showed the eurozone’s manufacturing sector is in the grip of a jobs boom. Factories in France are hiring at their best pace since 2000 and in Spain at a rate not seen since before the start of monetary union in 1998, according to IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ index.“This is close to utopia”, said James Nixon, chief eurozone economist at Oxford Economics.The eurozone’s economic health has confounded critics this year after a series of electoral setbacks for Eurosceptic parties in the Netherlands, Austria and France boosted business and consumer confidence.The bloc’s economy has expanded for 17 consecutive quarters since 2013 and unemployment has dropped to a nine-year low of 9.1 per cent in June. More than 1.5m people left unemployment in the past 12 months, according to Eurostat.“These numbers are at the top of what is possible to be sustained. If you look at the number of jobs that are being created, this is a very impressive performance,” Mr Nixon said.Spain registered the best growth rate among the eurozone’s largest economies, with 0.9 per cent in the three months to June. The eurozone’s fourth-largest economy has finally exceeded its pre-crisis GDP level after a property crash and a banking meltdown in 2012.Growth in France edged up to 0.55 per cent from 0.5 per cent. Germany and Italy report second-quarter growth next week.The eurozone expansion has outstripped the UK, which grew 0.3 per cent in the quarter. US growth clocked in at 0.65 per cent.A brightening world economy, weak exchange rate and still subdued levels of inflation have helped to drive the eurozone’s steady recovery through export growth and higher consumption. Fiscal policy has turned broadly neutral since 2015 after years of severe austerity during the sovereign debt crisis.Even Greece, beset by a near eight-year depression, clocked up its second consecutive rise in manufacturing activity in July, according to Markit.“Growth has not been concentrated in the traditional hotspots and economies that have traditionally not done so well are also joining in the recovery” said Ken Wattret, managing director of global macroeconomics at TS Lombard.The 0.6 per cent reading is almost twice the bloc’s average growth in the wake of the financial crisis. Even if growth were to slow to 0.4 per cent in the remaining two quarters of the year, it would drive annual expansion to 2 per cent for the first time since 2007.Economists said the GDP reading was not as buoyant as some euphoric survey measures have suggested. Sentiment indicators in Germany have hit record levels this year while measures of the private sector economy — as compiled through the PMIs — topped pre-crisis levels in June. The European Commission’s economic sentiment index hit a decade high last week.The slight undershoot in the official figures “shows how much expectations have changed” in the eurozone, added Mr Wattret.",https://www.ft.com/content/edd41c68-76a4-11e7-a3e8-60495fe6ca71,

Sign up here to receive our newsletter.North Korea’s economy grew in 2016 at the fastest pace since 1999, helped by a recovery from a drought in 2015. Military spending, including on testing nuclear weapons and missiles, also boosted growth, and raised tensions in the region.Gross domestic product expanded 3.9 percent from a year earlier, according to an estimate from the Bank of Korea. The expansion was concentrated in mining, manufacturing, and utilities such as electricity, gas, and water supplies. Per capita income in the North was estimated at 1.46 million won ($1,300), or about 4.5 percent of that of its southern neighbor’s.The BOK said it estimates North Korea’s economic growth by using raw data compiled by related organizations such as the intelligence agency and unification ministry. The calculation has limits, with the BOK using South Korean data such as prices to substitute for unknown information.North Korea’s missiles and development of weapons of mass destruction are measured as investment and production and support GDP growth, said Shin Seung-cheol, an official at the BOK’s economic statistics department. Missile tests could also be included in government spending, Shin said, adding that it’s hard to tell from the data when the weapons were developed, or how many weapons there are.The expansion came despite progressively tighter sanctions that the international community has imposed as the North steps up tests of missiles and nuclear weapons. The UN Security Council passed a resolution in November that tightened sanctions, including cutting the country’s coal exports, after the regime conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests.The South Korean government also pulled out of the Gaeseong industrial park in early 2016. The facility had been a key source of foreign capital for the North. The penalties have failed to deter North Korea, who said it successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile this month.China accounted for 93 percent of North Korea’s trade in 2016, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul said in a separate statement on Friday. The Pyongyang regime’s overall trade volume increased 4.7 percent last year to $6.55 billion, the data showed.The outlook for this year doesn’t look as good, with crop production hit by the worst drought since 2001, according to a report from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Early season harvest was down by 30 percent and planting for the main crops was disrupted, the report said.— With assistance by Adrian Leung, Kanga Kong, and Andy Sharp",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-21/north-korea-s-economy-rebounds-from-drought-amid-missile-focus,

We are fifteen years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years. The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. Obama sets agenda for 2016 election in State of the Union. At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that. “If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.” As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night. “It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.” We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way. We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007. But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them. That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle-class economics require in our time? First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here’s one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare. In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have. It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here’s another example. Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It’s the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It’s 2015. It’s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That’s not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future. That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero. Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. 21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. 21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair. Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let’s give them one more reason to get it done. 21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it’s where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That’s what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.” These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn’t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information. If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act. Well, I’m not a scientist, either. But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got. There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now it’s time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It’s not who we are. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past. Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading — always — with the example of our values. That’s what makes us exceptional. That’s what keeps us strong. And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own. You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia. I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard. I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home. So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes. I’ve served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. That’s a better politics. That’s how we start rebuilding trust. That’s how we move this country forward. That’s what the American people want. That’s what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years: “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.” My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We’ve laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-na-pn-transcript-state-of-the-union-20150120-story.html,
The economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/,True,True,True,True,False,Unrelated,,State of the Union: Obama's Economic Proposals Add to Growing 2016 Debate,"With both parties in Washington fixated on finding new ideas to help America's middle class, President Barack Obama in his State of the Union Tuesday called for universal, free community college, guaranteed paid sick leave and more tax hikes on the wealthy, using his bully pulpit to set policy markers that presidential candidates in both parties must now react to.In his first six years in office, Obama has been dogged by criticism over the economy, with Republicans and even some centrist Democrats suggesting his policies were ineffective in helping the country recover from the recession.Now with the federal deficit dropping and huge job growth over the last year, Obama is articulating proposals that reflect a country no longer in an economic crisis. His speech Tuesday included many ideas targeted at middle-class Americans who have not benefited from the economic growth, including his proposal to offer seven days of paid sick leave for workers who don’t get it now.Those plans are unlikely to get any traction in the GOP-led Congress but Obama provided an opening salvo in a coming debate over tax reform and domestic politics that will impact both his last two years in office and the 2016 campaign.With a stronger economy, Republican candidates will now have to grapple with Obama’s notion of middle class economics, and they will no longer be able to dismiss all of his ideas as emanating from a job-killing administration.And with the president articulating unabashedly liberal proposals, like creating a new tax on Wall Street firms, progressive activists in the Democratic Party will be challenging Hillary Clinton both to embrace Obama’s ideas and go further.We now are in a place where we can see that the steps we've taken are working, and we want to build on those steps, where with the crisis behind us we can begin to tackle the challenge that has been around for decades of wage stagnation, declining economic mobility and we can do what we can to help the middle class right now, said White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer.Only one 2016 candidate, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat, has officially even formed an exploratory committee. But more than a dozen Republicans are considering runs, as are Clinton and a handful of others on the Democratic side.These candidates will face a much different environment than even two years ago, when Mitt Romney unsuccessfully challenged the president.The economic recovery will make it more difficult for Republicans to adopt their approach of 2012 and 2014: Simply bashing the president at every turn, while offering few specific ideas of their own.Tonight, we turn the page, the president said in his speech. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.In an interview with the conservative website Newsmax before the speech, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packer CEO and Republican who is considering a 2016, grudgingly acknowledged the economic gains.He will apparently declare victory on the economy tonight, but of course, whatever life there is in the economy is not due to his policies, it's in spite of his policies, she said.Stagnant wages are a much different problem than high unemployment, and the candidates will have to adjust.Launching the website for his new political action committee, likely 2016 GOP candidate Jeb Bush sounded like liberal Democrat Elizabeth Warren, writing, while the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners, they’ve been a lost decade for the rest of America. In a speech on Friday, Romney, considering a 2016 run, spoke of helping lift people out of poverty as one of his main policy goals, a phrase he rarely used in 2012.For Republicans, the challenge will be how to offer compelling ideas that don’t cost too much money or increase the size of government, both verboten among conservatives.The president's plan for free community college sounds good in theory, but it's entirely irresponsible, said former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Once again, he fails to recognize that hard working taxpayers foot the bill for all of his liberal giveaways.For Clinton, the issue is different. Her husband distanced himself from Democrats of the past by declaring the era of big government is over and looking to find solutions in the political middle on many issues. Both Clintons have strong ties to business interests, including Wall Street.The Obama agenda involves creating new entitlement programs and mandates that conservatives oppose. And embracing some ideas in Obama’s agenda — such as his sick leave proposal, which would require businesses to change their practices — could make it harder for Clinton to run as a less partisan Democrat than Obama, as she has hinted she would like to do.At least on Tuesday, she embraced Obama's direction.@BarackObama #SOTU pointed way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class. #FairShot #FairShare, she said in a Twitter message.",https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2015-state-of-the-union/state-union-obamas-economic-proposals-add-growing-2016-debate-n290126,

No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal supermax facility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors.",No inmate has escaped from federal supermax prison,"In a speech defending his plans for the detainess at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, President Barack Obama said Americans should not be concerned about them being transferred to the United States because federal prisons are secure.Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders — highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety, Obama said. Bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal ' supermax ' prisons.First, we should note that Obama's comment suggests there is more than one federal supermax  facility. But there's actually just one, the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states have built their own maximum security prisons, but it's clear Obama was referring to federal facilities because they would be the ones to house the suspected terrorists.The security of the Alcatraz of the Rockies, as the Florence prison is known among correctional program professionals, has been cited frequently by Democrats as lawmakers and the administration battle over where to relocate the detainees. Obama is seeking to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010.Many Republicans believe it should remain open, and many Democrats have also grown wary. A bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked funding to close the facility until Obama comes up with a more detailed plan on what would happen to the detainees.Meanwhile, some Senate Democrats, including Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , have suggested that a supermax prison is the best place to house the suspected terrorists.   As you might expect, living is austere at the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Prisoners are kept in small cells and have limited contact with others. Florence is already home to several widely known international and domestic terrorists, including the shoe bomber Richard Reid, and Zacarias Moussaoui , a man sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.As for Obama's statement, federal prison officials confirmed that he is correct. No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal supermax facility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors.

Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal 'supermax' prisons.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/barack-obama/obama-correct-no-inmate-has-ever-escaped-supermax-/,True,True,True,Can not judge,True,Unrelated,,Just how bad are American 'supermax' prisons?,"The European Court of Human Rights has rejected arguments by Babar Ahmad and three other terror suspects that they could face ill treatment in a supermax American high-security prison.But what is life like in the Alcatraz of the Rockies and why was the court not convinced?The Administrative Maximum facility (ADX), or supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, holds some of the most notorious American terrorists and murderers in solitary confinement.The prison is home to about 360 inmates held under ultra-high security.It is here, the suspects argued, they could end up if found guilty of terrorism in the US.But the European Court of Human Rights found that a life sentence in the prison would be justified.Extreme solitary confinement and reduced environmental stimulation is how Thomas Silverstein, a convicted multiple murder, has described conditions at the Supermax prison. In a 2007 lawsuit challenging the conditions of his imprisonment, Silverstein said he was subject to 24-hour surveillance, locked in an 8.5ft by 10ft cell for as many as 23 hours a day, and took meals and exercised alone. The cells in Z-Unit - a special segregation unit - contained a bed with metal restraint rings, a sink, toilet and shower. One had a mirror, cement walls and a small window he could only see out of when he stood on his desk. The other cell had no mirror - only a small window covered in mesh and painted over, he said. Silverstein, 60, had been convicted of murdering another prisoner at a maximum security prison in Illinois. He said he exercised an hour a day by himself in 10ft by 10ft dog-kennel-like cement yard attached to his cell. He said he was entombed by a sound-proof door that prevented him from talking to other inmates, and in any case he was barred from contacting other inmates. The conditions, he said, caused depression, hallucination, disorientation and memory loss. He said the damage went beyond the boundaries of what most human beings can psychologically tolerate.According to the court: If the applicants were convicted as charged, the US authorities would be justified in considering them a significant security risk and in imposing strict limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world.Based on evidence from the US Department of Justice and statements from the American prison, the court said conditions in the jail would not breach human rights.The prison, known for its high-profile inmates, small cells and restrictions on contact with the outside world, has an infamous international reputation: mainly because of its policy of holding its inmates in almost permanent solitary confinement.The facility, 108 miles (173km) from Denver, holds convicted terrorists, militant anti-government extremists, gangsters, and other criminals considered so violent and dangerous mere maximum-security prison is not safe enough.We have only the most violent, disruptive and escape-prone inmates in the federal system, says Mark Collins, a spokesman for the prison.Most of the prisoners are locked in spartan, 87-sq ft (8-sq m) cells; those under the strictest conditions are allowed out for as little as an hour a day, Mr Collins says.Contact with other human beings is strictly limited - mostly to prison guards, counsellors and other staff.Inmates who follow the rules can be rewarded with further time out of their cells and more opportunities to interact with other prisoners, Mr Collins says.But current and former inmates, lawyers and others familiar with the prison describe it as an infernal environment in which even the design of the cells and the architecture of the prison conspire to render the inmates docile and drive them mad.People talk about it as being a cleaner version of hell, says Colin Dayan, a professor of English at Vanderbilt University and author of The Law Is a White Dog: How Legal Rituals Make and Unmake Persons, who has studied high security prisons in the US.It's immaculate. It's no black hole. It's not your typical sense of the hole of solitary confinement. You are staring upon nothingness: Concrete all the time. The architecture itself is the form of the torture.It is this reputation that lawyers for Babar Ahmad, Syed Tahla Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz used in their defence.According to the court, US Authorities would consider it impossible to detain Abu Hamza, the fifth suspect, at the supermax prison because of his disabilities (particularly the amputation of his forearms).Lawyers for the other four suspects argued that the tough prison conditions would amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, under the Human Rights Act.Last week Babar Ahmad told the BBC: I am facing extradition to the United States and spending the rest of my life in solitary confinement.But the court's judgement said that the facilities for prisoners, including television, radio, newspapers, books and telephone calls, went beyond what was provided in most prisons in Europe.In its ruling the court pointed out that not all inmates convicted of international terrorism were housed at ADX. The judgement said procedural safeguards are in place for prisoners and that they can bring claims to the attention of US authorities.But Dr Sharon Shalev, a criminologist at the London School of Economics, who has visited American high-security facilities, said: Supermax prisons are very extreme. I have a feeling the courts don't realise how extreme they are. I've yet to see a European prison as extreme.Prisoners spend most of the day inside a small cell with no view and no contact with other humans. Everything is done from inside the cell.Even during medical treatment doctors stand at the gate of the cell. American authorities would have you believe this is meaningful human contact.Dr Shalev said she had seen horrifying cases of people who went into prison sane, but ended up self-harming and attempting suicide as a result of solitary confinement.Ray Luc Levasseur, a former inmate at ADX Florence Penitentiary in Colorado, told the Today programme: It doesn't always stop with damage... it doesn't always have to stop with the mind.It can move on into degrading your soul, your spirit. And a prisoner who's been damaged like this - from point of view of the prison wardens - that prisoner is more controllable, more manageable.",http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17663629,

Commonly referred to as a “Supermax” prison, it has 490 beds in a compound which encompasses 37 acres.The prison was designed to house prisoners deemed too dangerous or high-profile for regular incarceration, and nearly 95% of all inmates that have been sent to Florence were transfers with histories of violent behavior in other prison facilities.ADX Florence is known for its harsh conditions; inmates are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. The hour they are allowed out is into a bigger cell with vaulted ceilings called the “empty swimming pool.” This room has a 4-inch by 4-foot skylight as the only window. It is designed to prevent the prisoners from knowing where they are, and they still spend this time alone.For at least the first three years, prisoners are not allowed to come into contact with other prisoners at any time – anywhere on the premises. Over time, good behavior can earn inmates more “outside” time, and for the most fortunate a possible transfer back to a less-secure prison can await.The cell furniture is limited to a desk, stool, and a bed, and each is constructed of poured concrete. The toilets are designed to shut off if plugged and the showers are on timers. Rooms may have mirrors, lights, radios, and in very rare instances televisions – but these are used as privileges based on behavior and are seldom awarded.There is no mess hall; food is hand-delivered to each inmate by the guards. The prison has a multitude of motion detectors and cameras, 1,400 remote-controlled steel doors, and 12-foot high razor wire fences. As an added level of security, laser beams, pressure pads, and attack dogs guard the area surrounding the prison’s outlying fences.Conditions are described as harsh, but clean and fair; it would be difficult to classify the prisoners as being “unfairly treated” given the circumstances which likely got them there. Former ADX wardens have described the place as “a cleaner version of Hell.”The prison operates under the strategy of sensory deprivation and solitude. Inmates are left to their own thoughts, which often leads to hallucinations, memory loss, and increasingly irritable behavior.ADX Florence is home to some of this country’s most violent and evil criminals; it is also the number-one holding facility for convicted terrorists. As of the date of this article, the prison houses over 400 violent criminals including those involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and 2001 World Trade Center Attacks.There are other notable criminals such as the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, shoe bomber Richard Reid, Oklahoma City bomber accomplice Terry Nichols, Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph, and Soviet spy Robert Hanssen (all pictured above).One of the most famous residents is Thomas Silverstein (at left), a convicted murderer and former Aryan Brotherhood leader who has committed four additional murders while imprisoned.Silverstein currently holds the record of being the longest resident of solitary confinement in the United States prison system, having been in solitary since 1983. Silverstein is often credited with being one of the reasons the ADX Supermax was designed due to his uncontrollable activities in other prisons.Defenders of the Supermax prison point out that criminals housed inside have previously shown no regard for human life on multiple occasions, with many having committed murders in other prisons around the country in addition to their initial heinous crimes.Historically, the addition of another life sentence to a prisoner who already has one hasn’t proved successful. Harsher penalties were needed to restore order and deter prisoners from killing prison guards. The threat of being transferred to solitary confinement at ADX Florence is the best deterrent in the prison system The United States has against violent crime.",http://sometimes-interesting.com/2011/07/12/the-most-secure-prison-adx-florence/,

Nine escaped from minimum- or medium-security facilities. Authorities recaptured all 10 within a day, state officials said.Prison officials have far more trouble with inmate suicides and violence directed at prison staff, statistics show. In 2013 alone, New York prisons reported 161 suicide attempts and 645 assaults on staff members.New York corrections officials found that since 1983 the prison escape rate has dropped precipitously: The annual total of escapees dropped from 29 in 1983 to one in 2013, even as the state's prison population grew 75% from 30,510 to 53,550.It's very rare — this happens very infrequently, which is why it's such a story, said Martin Horn, a professor of corrections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York. When he attempted to study breakouts recently, he recalled, There weren't even enough incidents to study.U.S. prisons, he said, may not do a great job on everything, but they do a pretty good job of holding on to the prisoners.Nationwide, an estimated 1.6 million people were in state or federal prisons in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. An estimated 2,001 inmates were reported as absent without leave (AWOL)/escape in 2013 by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, but those totals also include inmates who disappeared in other ways such as work release, not just those who broke out of cell blocks.In 2009, the federal government reported 2,845 inmates as AWOL/escape. At the time, the overall prison population topped out at 1,615,487.In the New York escape last weekend, the two suspects evidently used power tools to drill precision holes through cell walls and pipes. The Clinton Correctional Facility, a 150-year-old state prison in Dannemora, N.Y., hadn't seen an escape from its maximum-security section since the Civil War, Horn noted.The staff comes to believe that nobody can escape, he said. When the idea that the prison is impregnable takes hold, he said, state becomes complacent, and complacency leads to mistakes. And mistakes contribute to escapes.The prison's advanced age may have actually worked against it, since old facilities require more frequent updates. As a result you're continually bringing in outside contractors, Horn said.While most prisons do a very good job keeping track of their tools, he said, When you have multiple projects going on, as may be the case in an old prison, it becomes extremely difficult to keep track of tools.Kevin Tamez, managing partner for the MPM Group, a consulting firm near Philadelphia that does corrections work, said such lapses could become more common as the USA's prison system ages.Echoing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said the pair needed the assistance of someone to escape, Tamez on Monday said the two escapees undoubtedly had outside help, possibly from a contractor.There is absolutely no way these two knuckleheads got out of there the way they did by themselves, he said. They had to have been well-coached, well-informed and obviously well-supplied.He predicted an investigation into the breakout would reveal an understaffed prison and lax oversight of contractors. The questions are going to be extremely embarrassing to answer, he said. The ball was dropped a couple of places: Nobody heard anything, nobody saw a guy bringing a (power) saw into a cell.CUNY's Horn said prisons like Clinton face a dilemma, since they hold virtually no one but inmates serving life terms. Such prisoners have nothing to lose from trying to escape, he said. There's every incentive for them to try and try again — and try again.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/08/prison-escape-statistics/28693731/,

Prison facilities that are built to be responsible for holding up notorious criminals have gone through an amazing amount of evolution over the centuries. Bars and guards aren't enough in this day and age, and prison security measures today are as advanced - sometimes as primitively simple - as they can get.Colorado's penitentiary, ADX Florence, is perhaps the most secure prison the world has ever seen. We're talking about a maximum lock-down jail where it is said that prisoners are lucky if they ever get to see the sun. With a cell that has no direct access, prisoners are locked up the whole day, without any measure that could possibly help them get out.Perhaps one of the most famous prisons on the planet, Alcatraz has housed prisoners like Al Capone, Whitey Bulger and Rafael Miranda. Located on an island 2 kilometres off the shore of San Francisco, only 5 of the 14 prison escape attempts ever made were unaccounted for - who were presumed to be dead. Alcatraz shut down in 1968, but still holds the reputation of being one of the toughest prisons to break out of. You know, swimming's never been a convict's forte.Built in in 1867, in the very heart of the national capital, Paris, France's La Santé Prison is one of the most famous prisons in the world - no exaggeration. La Santé is notoriously known for being the prison that once you go to, you're not going to come out of till you come out. Despite its location in the heart of the city, the prison's architecture and security measures are so simple and effective that it is impossible to get out. A few years ago, a couple of hundred prisoners had to figure this out the hard way, when what they thought was a way out of prison - a sewage pipe - was locked down too, and most suffocated to death. That's a shitty death.Mumbai's largest and oldest central prison, Arthur Road Jail is no joke. Built in 1926, the facility that was originally designed to house 1000 prisoners is home to over 2000 inmates at the moment. But apart from the run-down prison conditions and obvious human rights infringement speculation, no prisoner has ever been known to break out, and no outsider has ever been able to break in. The prison spanning over 2 acres was built to be an impenetrable fortress. And it stands till date true to its nature.From the simplest and oldest prisons, let's us move on to one of the most advanced security measures prisons have ever taken. Few details are known about the Fuchu Prison in the western region of Tokyo, that has also played host to World War II prisoners in the past. Home to some of the most notorious criminals in Japan, the Fuchu prison has a perfect track record of no escaped prisoners. Well, none yet. There are more advanced security measures here than you can imagine, and Japan doesn't want anyone to know.Indiana's Federal Correctional Complex is a maximum-security prison that employs a minimal number of human personnel. Yet, it is considered one of the most secure prisons in the country. Well, with 30-degree surveillance cameras under a constant, facial recognition, motion sensors, biometric locks and a fair amount of the shitty luck most convicts have is more than enough reason for them to not need more manpower. I mean, if Ethan Hunt had to go to prison, this one would be it.The prison facility at Camp Delta, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is one that requires no introduction. Part of the base operated by the American armed forces, it is a detainment facility that houses criminals that are considered of highest priority by the US. We're talking about the place where Al Qaeda suspects were imprisoned and tortured. Up to 12 guards could be assigned to constantly watch over a single prisoner. In fact, let's say you even sneak out of there, you'd step into the middle of a military base. Good luck with that.HM Prison Belmarsh in Greenwich in South East London is where 'category A' prisoners are  - as deemed by Her Majesty. Functional as a high security prison since 1991, Belmarsh holds over 1000 inmates which include Britain's most dangerous and violent. The security level at the facility is high enough for it to have been earned the nickname, 'British Guantanamo'.Built by the French Mandate forces in the early 20th century as a military barracks, Tadmor Military Prison in Syria is now known as one of the hardest prison to survive in, thanks to its insane human rights violations and abysmal living conditions. As far as breaking out goes, the facility is in the middle of a desert some 200 kilometres north east of the Syrian capital, Damascus. On top of which the only way to get in or out of the prison is one tunnel that you would have to crawl. Which, of course, is highly secure.Located at 3000 feet above sea level, deep inside a desolate valley in the Changping District of Beijing lies a facility with over 5000 security personnel guarding the most notorious prisoners of the country. Qincheng was built with aid from the Soviet Union in 1958, and was originally used in the detainment of Kuomintang war criminals. The prison boasts of the tallest watchtower in the world, looking over a facility that is surrounded by valleys on all sides.

No-one has ever escaped.",Alcatraz of the Rockies: The supermax prison where Abu Hamza is going,"This is where Abu Hamza may get his just deserts.Standing miles from anywhere, the bleak fortress-like super-prison dubbed the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' is the place the hate preacher is expected to die behind bars.ADX Florence in Fremont Country, Colorado, houses the most dangerous inmates in the U.S. prison system and is believed to the world's most secure prison.Hamza is expected to be handed a life term after his convictions for a string of terror offences. The hook-handed Islamist cleric – who for years spouted evil on the streets of Britain – was convicted by a New York court of 11 charges after a five-week trial.The firebrand, 56, who was tried under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, had denied helping to organise a hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 when three Britons were killed. He is currently awaiting sentencing.However, Hamza is expected to apply within weeks to be moved to a cushy U.S. medical prison serve his life sentence. He wants to be transferred to the Federal Medical Centre in Devens, Massachusetts, where he will have access to a craft room and a music practice room.He will also be able to take continuing education classes or play hockey - and even study culinary arts.The application for the move will be put in by Hamza’s lawyers on the grounds that his disability - he has stumps for arms and only one eye - means he needs preferential treatment.The proper name for the prison in Florence is the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility. It is currently home to 490 convicted terrorists, gang leaders and neo-Nazis. Many have been transferred from other prisons after killing inmates or prison staff.They include Richard Reid, the attempted shoe bomber; Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th 9/11 hijacker; and al-Qaeda terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1993 and the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.It has been suggested Egyptian-born Hamza may have come across his new neighbours before. He led the Finsbury Park Mosque in London in the 1990s, which was reportedly attended by both Moussaoui and Reid, but denied ever having met them.Hamza is likely to go to H-unit, home to a number of Islamist terrorists and Robert Hanssen, a FBI agent serving a life sentence for passing secrets to Russia. Some have held hunger strikes.D-unit houses home-grown terrorists including Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, and Eric Rodolph, who bombed the Atlanta Olympics.Better behaved prisoners are granted extra privileges, with the best behaved given five hours of phone calls a month and the right to eat together out of their cells.The five extradited men will be allowed to see the imam four times a week. The library holds 158 Arabic books and 320 videos and DVDs on Islam. They will have the right to pray in their cells and have prayer beads, rugs and headgear. Inmates can also use a law library for two hours a day. Following Hamza's conviction, British Prime Minister David Cameron today pledged to 'take more steps' to speed up the deportation of people who pose a threat to his country.Mr Cameron said it was 'good that he has faced justice' and insisted he would take action to speed up the extradition process if his Conservative Party remains in government next year.Mr Cameron told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it's good that he has faced justice and justice has been done. I think we should reflect on whether we can extradite faster.'I think Theresa May, the Home Secretary, did a brilliant job. It took 10 years but Abu Hamza, off to America, and, of course, Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan.'We have made progress in a way no government before us has made progress and we should be clear that we have got a good domestic record in terms of prosecuting and convicting people who are guilty of terrorist offences here in Britain.'He added: 'I think speeding up extradition and speeding up deportation... I think we need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly, and we have made changes there.'Obviously, we also need to look, as I've said many times, at the European Convention on Human Rights and the position that we have got to get into where, if someone threatens our country, we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential that we restore that.'We have taken some big steps but I plan to take more steps if I'm elected as a Conservative Prime Minister after the next election.'",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2633716/Inside-Alcatraz-Rockies-The-supermax-prison-Colorado-Abu-Hamza-spend-rest-life.html,

The forbidding place, where the nation’s most violent offenders and terrorists are confined, is where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is likely to end up if just one of 12 jurors decides to sentence the convicted Marathon bomber to life in prison.What distinguishes the ADX, as it’s known, from other federal prisons is that it was designed for solitary confinement. Many of the more than 400 prisoners are required to spend 23 hours a day alone in their 7-by-12-foot concrete cells, where they receive all their meals on trays slid through small holes in the steel doors, see limited natural light from a sliver of a window, and are permitted little contact with anyone other than guards and staff.When prisoners are allowed out of their cells, they are escorted by multiple guards and are required to wear leg irons, handcuffs, and belly chains. Their recreation hour is usually spent in a small outdoor cage, which is surrounded by high gray walls with a view of the sky etched by barbed wire.“The ADX is a far more stark environment than any other prison I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been to all of the federal prisons,” said Robert Hood, who served as warden of the ADX between 2002 and 2005. “When I call it a clean version of hell, I mean that it’s squeaky clean and quiet, because everyone there is locked down. It’s a very abnormal environment.”Tsarnaev could also be sent to the ADX if the jury sentences him to death, Hood and others said, but it’s more likely that the Federal Bureau of Prisons would assign him to the penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., where he could spend years, perhaps decades, among other death row inmates as his lawyers appeal his sentence. Since the federal government reinstated capital punishment in 1988 only three federal prisoners have been executed, out of 74 sentenced to death.Tsarnaev could potentially have many more privileges and amenities if he is sent to Terre Haute. The prison there allows inmates, including some of those on death row, to congregate in “leisure activity” rooms, where they can play chess or cards, watch color TV, cook meals bought from the commissary in microwaves, and collaborate on art projects. If they are not put on special restrictions, they are permitted 300 minutes of nonlegal telephone calls a week and can send relatives e-mails. They can earn money in jobs as orderlies, borrow compact discs from the library to play on personal CD players, and use recreation areas that offer equipment such as stationary bicycles, treadmills, and computers.At the ADX, life is much lonelier and more monotonous. Tsarnaev, if he is sent to the forbidding facility, would join other notorious prisoners such as Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001; shoe bomber Richard Reid; and Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center.The prison was initially designed as a place to modify the behavior of inmates who committed violence at other penitentiaries, allowing them additional privileges over a period of years and ultimately a transfer to another prison if they complied with the rules. But in more recent years it has also become a permanent home for those convicted of terrorism-related crimes.Tsarnaev’s privileges in prison are already limited and are likely to continue to be strictly controlled after his sentencing by so-called special administrative measures, which restrict his contact with other people and must be approved once a year by the US attorney general.The 21-year-old from Cambridge, who was convicted this month on all 30 charges of conspiring with his late brother to kill three people and injure 260 others near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013 and also in the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer several days later, would likely end up in the ADX’s H Unit, which is reserved for prisoners who are subject to special restrictions on contact with others.That would mean he would be confined to his cell 23 hours a day, allowed three showers a week, and likely be limited to one 15-minute call a month to one of a few relatives, which would be monitored. Visits, even with his attorneys, would have to be conducted through Plexiglas and by telephone. Even his letters would be strictly limited — in length and to whom he could write.His cell, like all the other solitary units, would include an unmovable concrete stool, a concrete desk, and a concrete slab for a bed, with a thin foam mattress on top. He would have a combination sink-toilet and be allowed to buy a 10-inch black-and-white TV, which would let him watch major networks and some basic cable channels. Prison officials use televisions as leverage to control inmates’ behavior, threatening to remove them if prisoners fail to comply with the rules, Hood said.For one hour a day, Tsarnaev would have access to either an indoor recreation room with one pull-up bar, or the outdoor cage, where he could walk around and breathe fresh air. He would also have access to a library cart and could buy a limited number of items from the prison’s commissary, such as candy or toothpaste, though many of the items for sale could be barred to him by the special administrative measures.“There have been some reports that the conditions at Guantanamo are better than at the ADX,” said Laura Rovner, an associate law professor at the University of Denver College of Law who has represented 10 prisoners at the ADX. She said no one has won a lawsuit against the prison by arguing that the conditions are unconstitutionally “cruel and unusual.”RELATED | Globe 2013 report: Fall of the House of TsarnaevShe said the isolation is so overwhelming for prisoners that one of her clients befriended a wasp that somehow flew into his cell, feeding it and talking to it like a friend. Others have resorted to trying to communicate with fellow prisoners by yelling through vents and their cell’s plumbing.She and others cited court documents showing that seven prisoners have committed suicide since the ADX opened in 1994, the last occurring in 2013, when a prisoner hanged himself with a bed sheet. No one has ever escaped.“It’s a place that strips away your humanity,” she said. “It takes away the part of us that relates to other people, how we make sense of the world and attribute value.”Fellow attorneys in Denver and Washington, D.C., filed a class-action lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons in 2012, arguing that the prolonged solitary confinement at the ADX is cruel, especially for those prisoners with mental illnesses.Those attorneys declined to speak on the record, citing the litigation. Officials from the Bureau of Prisons denied the Globe’s request to visit the ADX and would not answer any questions about the prison.“As our primary focus at the ADX is on the day to day operations of the institution, there is, consequently, no allotted time for additional activities, to include personal interviews or tours,” wrote John Oliver, ADX’s warden, in a letter to the Globe.The government and the attorneys have been discussing a potential settlement for more than a year. It could result in changes at the prison that could reduce the degree of isolation of prisoners like Tsarnaev.RELATED | 2011: An inside look at Massachusetts prison life“Those who designed this place made little effort to provide any more than what a zoo provides – shelter, food, water,” said Jamie Fellner, who monitors prisons for Human Rights Watch in New York and has toured the ADX twice. “Human beings are not designed to handle that amount of isolation.”In a sworn statement as a part of a separate lawsuit filed against the Bureau of Prisons in 2011, Thomas Silverstein , who has spent more than three decades in solitary confinement after killing a guard at another federal prison, testified to the deprivation of going years without seeing “a single tree, a blade of grass, or any sign of nature.”He described the outdoor recreation area at the ADX — where he can take 10 steps in either direction and 30 steps if he walks in a circle — as similar to standing “inside of a deep, empty swimming pool.”“I couldn’t see any of the mountains, even though I knew they had to be close by,” he said.He added: “Other than infrequent haircuts, strip searches, and medical examinations, the only physical human contact I have experienced in 28 years is when BOP officers handcuff me and escort me.”Raymond Luc Levasseur, who spent nearly five years at the ADX after conducting a series of Marxist-inspired bombings around the United States, called the prison a “high-tech version of hell, designed to shut down all sensory perception.”“Nobody can go through that experience without being scarred,” he said in a telephone interview from his home in Maine. “It deadens you emotionally. You have to withdraw like a turtle into a shell.”Levasseur, now 68, said his vision deteriorated significantly while at the ADX, but with so little to look at, he didn’t notice. His hearing, on the other hand, became more acute. He said it would get “deathly quiet,” and all he could hear was his heartbeat. Then the silence would be interrupted by the “huge racket” of the doors of his cell abruptly rolling open for regular sight checks by the guards.He described the relatively antiseptic prison as “almost odorless,” except for the meals, which he said were mainly starchy foods like macaroni, potatoes, and cereals, with no second helpings allowed or wanted.Outside the manicured grounds of the ADX, which is more than 5,000 feet above sea level and shares a campus with lower-security federal prisons, few neighbors seemed concerned about the potential arrival of another notorious convict.In the city of nearly 4,000 people, where rusting trailers molder on cinder blocks and pawnshops hawk gold and guns, neighbors said they trust the security at the ADX.“If Tsarnaev is going to end up in prison, I’d rather him there than anywhere else,” said Charlie Luckey, 36, whose small home is just across the desolate Highway 67. “Even if someone makes it over the fence, there are sharpshooters who would take care of him.”Others said they were unconcerned, even if Tsarnaev somehow made it past all the remotely controlled doors, barbed wire, hundreds of cameras, and other electronic surveillance.“We’ve got plenty of our own guns and ammo,” said Sharon McMahon, who helps manage the Super 8 motel next door to the ADX. “He wouldn’t make it far.”",https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/25/the-alcatraz-rockies/a0BWrZjRpmQatMsfm8FUOL/story.html,

They're called supermax prisons. There are 31 of them around the country, and one of the biggest is the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colo. It's the only federal supermax in the country; the others are state prisons. The ADX Florence prison is home to about 500 of the most dangerous criminals in the country. Almost all inmates have been transferred from other facilities, where they were deemed a serious lethal threat or a high-escape risk. But unlike most American prisons -- relegated to the darkest or least populated edges of town -- this supermax sits in picturesque Florence, with a population of just 3,800, in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains. The paradox isn't lost on Florence Mayor Cindy Cox, a breezy woman with an infectious laugh who boasts of the antique-hunting opportunities in Florence and the indelible American charms of a town where people still leave their doors unlocked at night. There is no fear whatsoever,"" she told ABC News. ""There has never been an incident. You talk to people, and they don't even know Supermax is up there. It's the American criminal capital of the world,"" Cox said. She said that the only time the prison even comes up in local conversation is when they feature employees of the month in the paper. ""And a lot of families follow their inmate family members around. There will be some issues in the school because some of the kids come from gang families."" Cruel and Unusual? No one has ever escaped from the prison since it was built in 1994. Deep in the recesses of the Florence facility, inmates tick away the hours in solitude, with little sunlight, spending 22-plus hours a day in their cells and no access to the bucolic world just outside the prison walls. The prison is home to a who's who of criminals. ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and ""Shoe Bomber"" Richard Reid. Ramzi Yousef, who plotted the 1993 World Trade Center attack lives there, behind the miles of barbed wire and steel in a tiny cell deep inside the flagship facility. Supermax prisons, with their notorious isolation wards are not without detractors. Critics call them inhumane. Several states have been sued, most often citing the Eight Amendment ban on ""cruel and unusual punishment."" In 2005, supermax inmates in Ohio won a U.S. Supreme Court case, using the 14th Amendment's right to ""due process."" The court ruled that isolation constitutes an atypical hardship and agreed that inmates have the right to appeal before prison officials can place an inmate in isolation. Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph is another Florence supermax inmate. In 2006, Rudolph wrote to a letter to a newspaper saying that being confined to isolation was driving him insane. ""It is a closed-off world designed to isolate inmates from social and environmental stimuli, with the ultimate purpose of causing mental illness and chronic physical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and arthritis, he told The Gazette of Colorado Springs. My Slice of Sky Some supermax inmates seemed to be able to adjust to life in isolation. Charles Harrelson, was sent to ADX Florence. The late father of actor Woody Harrelson was convicted of killing a federal judge in Texas in 1979. A troublemaker in the prison system, Harrelson got himself transferred to Florence after a failed attempt to escape from a Georgia prison. Harrelson revealed slices of life in Supermax in conversations and in a series of letters to attorney Robert Tiernan. ""We struck up a friendship,"" Tiernan told ABC News. Eventually Harrelson came to describe his life inside. ""I promised to describe my cage and daily routine for you Bob. The cell is some 10' wide and 15' deep, 10' by 12' is the usable space. And then the bed, shower and commode/sink take up most of that,"" Harrelson wrote, noting that the one bit of the outside he saw was a slice of the sky. ""Part of the plan here is sensory deprivation,"" Harrelson wrote, his penmanship consistent and precise, Tiernan said. Tiernan, who fondly recalls Harrelson as a ""fascinating person, not very educated but very very smart, a real gentleman,"" noted that Harrelson was once deemed ""a huge escape risk."" Not at supermax though, where Harrelson was something of an ideal inmate, gaining privileges such as a TV and radio over time. As a ""tenant of this hospice,"" as Harrelson put it, he seemed resigned to the fact that there was no way out. ""I'm unable to exercise any control over anything outside this cage,"" Harrelson wrote. ""I simply do my best with what I have."" Harrelson wrote that he generally ignored his opportunity to go outside for an hour and enjoyed the simple pleasures of a shower and reading ""until the wee hours."" ""The station that airs NPR in Colorado Springs switches over to the BBC radio broadcast each morning,"" he wrote. ""It's my window on the world. I love it."" 'Bizarro' World Tiernan, who visited Harrelson on a few occasions, noted a strange feeling in the contrast between Florence and the world his inmate friend called home. As a visitor, Tiernan was led two stories down to a windowless room where he would wait, once for several hours, to see Harrelson. Tiernan characterized the experience as like being in a backward ""Bizarro"" world. ""The doors on the bathrooms lock on the outside instead of in. There is just no way out,"" Harrelson said. ""And they go inside a pit, like an empty swimming pool, to exercise, so that you don't know where you are."" Few Fates Worse Than This One Harrelson, as a ""cooperative"" inmate, enjoyed his earned privileges inside, such as the ability to watch some television alone in his cell. ""I watch David Letterman's monologue. My other TV watching is nearly all CNN and/or PBS."" He wrote that he liked ""Nova,"" ""Frontline"" and ""Nature,"" explaining to his pen pal and friend that life was bearable. Tiernan noted that Harrelson managed to cope in Florence by taking pleasures as they came. ""He enjoyed people coming to visit,"" Tiernan said. ""It could be infinitely worse,"" Harrelson told Tiernan.""I could have been raised in one of those religious families. I could have been born in Darfur or Baghdad or Jerusalem or somewhere in another of those Third World countries where every bite of beans is a struggle,"" Harrelson wrote. ""Hell, I could have been a Republican (shudder)! Those are only a few of the fates for worse than this one."" Harrelson died March 15, 2007, of heart failure. He was inside his cell at the time, of course.",http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3435989,
Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal 'supermax' prisons.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/barack-obama/obama-correct-no-inmate-has-ever-escaped-supermax-/,True,True,True,Can not judge,True,True,"ADX Florence has beds for around 500 prisoners and is part of a much larger federal prison complex. No one has ever escaped from ADX Florence, nor have there been any serious escape attempts. A former prison guard once described it as a ""cleaner version of hell.""",Supermax - torture in US prisons,"Solitary confinement is commonplace in US prisons. Most US states have over the last 30 years introduced specialised new segregation facilities, often referred to as supermax. Around 80,000 people are estimated to be incarcerated in facilities of this sort. But although supermax units are widespread across the various US state prison systems, there is just one federal supermax prison – the Administrative Maximum (ADX) facility in Florence, Colorado. The prisoners held there include persistent escapers, convicted mobsters and men convicted of terrorism offences.ADX Florence has beds for around 500 prisoners and is part of a much larger federal prison complex. No one has ever escaped from ADX Florence, nor have there been any serious escape attempts. A former prison guard once described it as a cleaner version of hell.Prisoners are confined to single cells for around 22-23 hours a day. Virtually everything in the cells, including the bed, is made from concrete. There is a fireproof mattress on the bed. Windows provide natural light, but are arranged so that only the sky can be seen through them. Prisoners eat their meals in their cells.The most rigorous section of the prison is H-Unit. It is used to house prisoners who have been put under Special Administration Measures (SAMs). Cells in this unit are of about 75.5 square feet. Prisoners are said to be allowed a minimum of 7 hours exercise out-of-cell exercise per week. This is an improvement on conditions a few years ago, when only 5 hours out-of-cell exercise was allowed. Prisoners exercise alone, in individual recreation areas.Prisoners can remain under SAMs for many years. Shoebomber Richard Reid (who prefers to be known as Abu Esa Abdul-Raheem) was under SAMs for the first six and a half years of his sentence. He brought a lawsuit challenging the conditions of his confinement, but this was dismissed in January 2010. Like other prisoners held under SAMs, he had almost no contact with the outside world apart from lawyers and close family.According to an affidavit filed by the prison in response to the lawsuit, he was permitted to communicate with other SAM inmates orally only during certain predesignated times, in a place and for a duration set by the Bureau [FBI]. He was only allowed to read books approved by the FBI. He was not allowed access to TV and radio channels that primarily broadcast news. Affidavits filed in the case provide a great deal of other background about conditions in ADX Florence.Cells in the General Population Unit are of about 86 square feet. General Population prisoners are said to be allowed at least 10 hours of out-of-cell exercise per week. They exercise in isolation. According the affidavit filed by the prison in Richard Reid's case, General Population Unit prisoners are allowed to communicate with other ADX General Population Unit inmates during recreation periods.At least one US court has hinted that life under supermax conditions is torture. U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema told convicted 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, apparently in anticipation of his transfer to ADX Florence, that to paraphrase the poet T.S. Eliot, you will die with a whimper.Isolation makes prisoners vulnerable to other forms of abuse. Three prison guards were convicted in 2003 of beating prisoners at ADX Florence. 52 acts of abuse against 20 or more prisoners were included in the indictment, filed in November 2000. The defendants were said to have covered up the abuse by fabricating records and other evidence and pressuring fellow officers to keep quiet. A former union official has claimed that the prison management knew about the beatings and that at least 30 guards were involved.ADX Florence is notoriously media-shy. Journalist Alex Hannaford toured Guantanamo in 2010. But this year the ADX Florence authorities turned down his request to tour their prison. They also refused to let him interview either prisoners or prison wardens (correctional officers). So he gleaned what he could from prisoners' letters to him, and turned up in Florence, Colorado to talk to correctional officers he had contacted through the American Federation of Government Employees. His article was published in the Sunday Times (Alcatraz of the Rockies, 18 March 2012; available online only to Sunday Times subscribers).One of the prisoners with whom Alex Hannaford corresponded was an American who asked for his name to be withheld; he is referred to as 'John.'There is very little reason to leave the cell. Almost everything you can think of is in [here]. It is very high tech; for instance to communicate with the officers I have an intercom box. I just hit the button and they answer. Any notices are posted on a closed-circuit channel on my TV…It is what it is. Real tough. But I'm a man and I deal with it. I don't complain.He wrote that visits are:only immediate family, non-contact – we are in different rooms, separated by glass – and again they are monitored live. Even though you are in a secure room, you spend the entire visit in leg shackles, waist chain and handcuffs.Since I have been in here I have literally seen people break and go crazy. They just snap and self-destruct. When it gets bad the medical department comes and gets them and just ships them off to prison hospital. You know what happened because the guy will just start screaming like he is being murdered. It will go on and on.You have to be very strong to survive this. The conditions we are under are just not natural. I keep my mind busy. I read a ton of books, take correspondence courses. I do everything I can to ensure that I leave a better person than when I came here. But this is hell. I can't say it any clearer than that.Many of the prison officers are former soldiers. 'John' wrote:Some of these guys are very young, just come back from Iraq and Afghanistan; seen their buddies get killed. Now they are in a unit with a hundred guys who they were told were the enemy.I hate this place with all my heart and I kick myself in the ass for doing anything to get sent here. The problem is the lack of outside stimulation. One phone call a month if you are not on restriction. Only the sky to see of the outside world. No conversation. Everything restricted. Then there's the noise; some of the knuckleheads scream for hours on end. No one should have to live like this.Journalist Susan Greene has also been corresponding with ADX Florence prisoners, as well as with prisoners held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the US. Her article was published as a Dart Society Report in January 2012 (The Gray Box: An investigative look at solitary confinement ).Osiel Rodriguez, a prisoner apparently in a General Population Unit at ADX Florence, wrote to her:I got it in my head to destroy all my photographs. I spent some five hours ripping each one to pieces. No one was safe. I did not save one of my mother, father, sisters. Who are those people anyway?”Looking at photos of the free world caused me so much pain that I just couldn’t do it any more. Time and these conditions are breaking me down.After 14 years, those people are strangers to me; as I must be to them. My parents will be dust if/when I ever get out of prison. My three sisters will be in their mid-70’s to late 60’s. So what was I doing holding on to photos of moments I was not a part of, or know nothing about?”“Ninety percent of the time you hear nothing but the sound of air from the ventilation. The silence can drive you crazy. Makes you feel as if the world has ended but you somehow survived and are tripped”This is difficult to explain, but my memories were no longer mine. I questioned whether or not I really had a past or history at all, whether the memories were real or false. … It was as though none of it was real. I was born into this life of isolation and the memories not memories at all. Confabulations.”ADX Florence prisoner Jack Powers described a similar sense of excruciating alienation. He wrote:The world outside is like another planet. I feel like I am trapped within a disease.”And in another letter he wrote:I miss being around people. I miss being able to run on the track or walk on grass or feel the sun on my face. One time I kept a single green leaf alive for a few weeks. And one time I had grasshopper for a pet. And one time I made a dwarf tree out of yarn from a green winter hat, paper and dried tea bags. I made a guitar out of milk cartons, and it played quite well. I invented a perfect family – mom, dad and sister – so that we could interact and love one another. One time I wanted to take a bath, so I got into a garbage bag and put water in it and sat there. For a while I made vases out of toilet paper and soap and ink from a pen. I have done a thousand and one things to replicate ordinary life, but these too are now gone.”It's easy to overlook the enormity of what is done to the prisoners in ADX Florence and other Supermax jails. Prison is tough. So what's new?Sit quietly and imagine. Imagine an hour in one of those concrete cells. Then imagine a whole day. A week. A month. A year. Five years…When the imagination fails, it's easy to play with moral puzzles instead. To wonder how the suffering of these men should be balanced against the suffering of the victims of those of them jailed for acts of violence. International law has pretty much answered that question. Long-term solitary confinement is torturous and cruel and therefore illegal. Period.Human rights experts joined prisoners, former prisoners and intellectuals in December 2010 in issuing a statement on solitary confinement and isolation that said we believe that enforced long-term isolation in all circumstances breaches Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Méndez, told the UN last October:Segregation, isolation, separation, cellular, lockdown, Supermax, the hole, Secure Housing Unit (SHU)… whatever the name, solitary confinement should be banned by States as a punishment or extortion technique.He proposed an absolute prohibition on solitary confinement in excess of 15 days.A report last September by the Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City Bar Association said that supermax confinement as practiced in the United States violates well-established international law.The report says no other country uses supermax confinement as broadly and systematically as does the United States.The European Court of Human Rights is currently considering appeals against extradition to the US by a number of British citizens accused by the US of terrorism. They include Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan. The main charges against these men appear to relate to activities that might better be described as internet activism. If convicted in the US, it is certain that they will be sent to ADX Florence. Talha Ahsan suffers from Asberger's Syndrome, which will compound the suffering and psychological damage produced by supermax confinement. The men's claim that extradition to solitary confinement would violate their rights under international law is the central issue being considered by the court.If ADX Florence was situated in any of the 47 countries that make up the Council of Europe (a body that includes the Russian Federation, Turkey and the Ukraine and is distinct from the EU) there can be no doubt that it would be judged illegal by the European Court of Human Rights. It only remains for the court to decide whether European citizens can lawfully be sent to the US to risk being jailed under conditions outlawed in Europe.There is already a European prohibition on the extradition of anyone at risk of execution, which is banned in Europe. The prohibition on long-term solitary confinement is clearer than the ban on capital punishment, being a worldwide, not merely a European, interpretation of international law. The court appears to have little choice but to block the extradition of Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan and their co-appellants, despite the irritation this is likely to cause in the US. The decision, when it comes, should be a wake-up call to the US to put its house in order.Update: the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Babar Ahmad, Haroon Rashid Aswat, Syed Tahla Ahsan and Mustafa Kamal Mustafa (Abu Hamza) will be handed down on 10 April 2012.",http://www.sacc.org.uk/articles/2012/supermax-torture-us-prisons,

Drug lords, terrorists, serial murderers, rapists and child molesters are the absolute worst of the worst. Special arrangements must be undertaken to ensure that they remain behind bars and that they do not escape to rejoin society.This is where supermax high-security prisons come in. This kind of prison ensures that the most dangerous criminals are segregated on a long-term basis. By keeping them inside, authorities ensure that they do not pose a threat to security and the peace and order situation anymore.Here is a list of the top 10 high-security prisons in the world. Conditions may be like hell, which is probably appropriate given the people who live in it.Qincheng Prison is a maximum-security prison in China that has one of the highest watchtowers in the world. Up to 5,000 security personnel ensure that the prisoners are kept locked in at all times. To add to its security, the prison is located 3,000 feet above sea level. A deep and desolate valley awaits those who plan to escape. Chinese authorities have also set up modern surveillance cameras and electronic equipment.How do you escape a prison that has practically no ground access gate to the outside world? That is how secure Tadmor Military Prison is. The only access to the facility is through an underground tunnel. One has to crawl to get in or out. There are laser beams deployed to ensure that the foolhardy that does try to escape will not succeed. Once inside, prisoners are tied up in heavy chains. Conditions are harsh and even inhumane, with prisoners getting beaten up regularly with metal rods. Executions also happen on a massive scale. The sad part is that not all the prisoners are actually criminals. Some are incarcerated simply because they oppose the Syrian government.Camp Delta is a prison facility in Guantanamo Bay. It is located in Cuba, though it officially belongs to the United States. The prison was used to house suspected terrorists in the fight against Al Qaeda.Torture was performed regularly in the past, though this has been cut down and even eliminated totally. Up to 12 guards may be assigned to one prisoner. And even if the prisoner manages to escape, there is the added obstacle in the fact that he would be escaping into an American military base. The border with Cuba is heavily fortified while crossing the sea will lead to Florida.Fuchu Prison is the largest prison facility in Japan. It is equipped with the latest surveillance gadgets and state-of-the-art equipment to ensure that prisoners are kept inside.Any small sign of a missing prisoner will trigger off one of the most advanced emergency alert system in the world.Arthur Road Jail is located in the city of Mumbai. Its cells are highly secure and built sturdily to withstand both break ins and escapes.It claims to be bomb-proof and that not even the most advanced weapons in the arsenal can break the walls and barriers of the prison. No one has ever escaped from this prison and it is highly doubtful if there is anyone foolish enough to try to break into it.Souza Baranowski Center is a prison facility located in Massachusetts. A team from the world-renowned institution of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, developed the prison’s surveillance system. The team built a highly advanced camera matrix system that is able to record 24 hours a day every conceivable angle in the facility.The doors are controlled electronically and are locked automatically. Even the perimeter of the facility is monitored and watched closely 24 hours a day. In other words, it has built a Big Brother type system that can watch the prisoners at all times anywhere.The Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana is a maximum-security prison that employs only a minimal number of guards. Electronic surveillance is done throughout this prison facility. Surveillance cameras afford a 360-degree view.These are monitored constantly in a control room. There are also motion detector sensors strategically located all over the prison. There is also a face detection technology to help identify the inmates. As if this was not enough, each prisoner’s cell has a biometric lock. It is said to be the most high tech prison in the world.La Sante Prison in Paris is an inescapable facility and hundreds of prisoners had to find this out the hard way.Several years ago, a group of prisoners tried to escape from the facility by going through the drainage system. Even that part of the facility proved to be so secure that the prisoners ended up getting trapped in the tunnel. As a result, most suffocated to death.This prison actually closed down in 1963, but its legend lives on because of its seemingly fortress status. America’s most notorious criminals stayed there, including Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, Rafael Miranda and Whitey Bulger.There were 14 escape attempts made by 36 prisoners, of which only five were unaccounted for and are presumed to have died by drowning.The prison was located in an island and escape from it meant having to swim 1.5 miles to the nearest mainland shore. It closed down as salt water kept eroding the buildings and San Francisco residents expressed concern over the sewage that the prisoners and the prison officers’ families were dumping into the sea.Located in Colorado, this is the most secure prison in the world. Prisoners are kept in their cells the whole day.No direct access is provided to the cells.Security is multi-tiered and prisoners would be lucky to get even a glimpse of the sun during their incarceration.",https://www.therichest.com/business/technology/top-10-high-security-prisons-in-the-world/,

Those unfortunate enough to be locked in one of these steel cages have committed heinous crimes against humanity, and would continue to do so if set free. Florence, Colorado houses the only complete Supermax prison in the U.S., though there are solitary confinement units within regular prisons throughout the country. Built in 1994, no one has ever escaped.",Anatomy of a SuperMax Prison,"No one knows what freedom feels like more than the inmates of a Federal Supermax prison, who have none. What most people take for granted as mundane everyday tasks – simple things like making coffee in the morning, feeding the cat, filling up the gas tank and waiting in line at the bank – are the stuff of fantasies of those in Supermax prisons. After conviction, these men spend the rest of their lives boxed in by steel walls, their communication with the outside world shut off entirely. But it’s not easy to end up here. The criminal justice system does not throw anyone into such desolate conditions. To be admitted, the crime must seriously infringe upon the freedom of others.Approximately 25,000 inmates in the United States spend their days in the most extreme state of non-freedom known to the West. A Federal Supermax Prison, short for super-maximum security, is a prison, or section of a prison, that is reserved for only the most dangerous criminals. It is a highly guarded containment facility in which each prisoner is kept in a single, tiny steel unit and only taken out for a solitary hour of exercise each day. That’s 23 hours of solitary confinement every day for a minimum of 25 years. They eat their meals alone, pushed through a slot in the door, they exercise alone and they are allowed absolutely no contact with the outside world.The infographic below gives a detailed visual of the “home” of these prisoners, along with many grim facts about the reality of prison life. As you can see, the cell does not look inviting and it does not look comfortable. Freedom may only exist in memories and fantasies for these men, but could they tell you what it means in their dreams? Absolutely.Such highly contained and segregated prison units are determined fit only for the “worst of the worst.” Inmates kept in these extremely isolated, cold and lonely cells are deemed high-risk prisoners who pose a threat to national or international security. They are generally not white collar thieves, robbers or drug dealers; these are dangerous mass murderers who would kill again given the chance. Thus, they are not allowed any contact with other people. By contrast, medium- and low-risk prison facilities may still separate prisoners from each other, but not to the extreme degree of those souls in permanent solitary confinement.You have probably heard of or seen TV reenactments of the infamous men kept in Supermax prisons. One thing they all have in common? Pervasive plans to murder, destroy or harm mass amounts of people without remorse. Ted Kazcynski, more commonly known as the “Unabomber,” made headlines in the 1990s for his covert mail bombings, which killed three people and harmed dozens. This particular domestic terrorism was based on his belief that he needed to call a revolution against our modern technological society. He does not believe he is insane, and pleaded guilty to life in prison without possibility of parole.Who else makes the cut? Terrorists are at the top of the list for Supermax prisons. Richard Reid is another man who harbors nefarious plans to destroy, this time in the name of Al-Queda. More commonly referred to as the “shoe bomber” because he tried to blow up an airplane using explosives hidden in his shoes, Reid also faces a sentence of life in prison without any chance of parole. Raul Leon, leader of the Mexican mafia, spends his days in solitary confinement, along with Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center attack, and Terry Nichols, accomplice in the Oklahoma City bombings.As you can see, Federal Supermax prisons are not simply for your Average Joe Criminal. Those unfortunate enough to be locked in one of these steel cages have committed heinous crimes against humanity, and would continue to do so if set free. Florence, Colorado houses the only complete Supermax prison in the U.S., though there are solitary confinement units within regular prisons throughout the country. Built in 1994, no one has ever escaped.For these prisoners, freedom is something of the past. But for their victims and would-be victims, freedom has been preserved and upheld. Inmates like the Unabomber may have had their freedom of movement stripped of them, but such extreme punitive measures are only a result of their unashamed infringement on the rights and freedoms of others. Most everyone would agree that criminal justice has been employed, as these men are now incapable of causing harm to anyone but themselves. The dreams of prisoners in Supermax facilities may consist of anything from savoring a home cooked meal to planning their next attack strategy, but one thing is for sure: the worst prisons are reserved only for the worst criminals, and they will do neither ever again.",https://carrington.edu/blog/administrative/anatomy-of-a-supermax-prison/,

No one has ever escaped.",U.S. 'supermax' prison: 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' is seen as 'inhuman and degrading',"U.S. prosecutors want Ali Charaf Damache in the worst way.An Irish resident originally from Algiers, Damache, 50, is accused of using online chat rooms to recruit American women into a would-be terrorist cell operating in this country and Europe.One man and two women, including Damache's wife, have already been convicted in U.S. courts of providing material support to terrorists. And Damache was captured by Irish authorities in 2010 in Dublin on a separate charge of making a telephone death threat and held without bail.But despite requests from U.S. prosecutors to have him extradited to this country for trial in Philadelphia, the High Court of Ireland has refused.It's not because they want to prosecute him themselves or believe he is innocent. Rather, the Irish court ruled that Damache, if sent to the United States, would probably be locked up in the federal supermax prison. And to the court, that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.The court's refusal to extradite Damache highlights the conflicting perspectives on incarceration between the U.S. and Europe. Some European nations see the U.S. prison system as a barbaric anomaly in a country that has often insisted on the protection of human rights around the world.Even a terrorism convict, the Irish High Court said, should not be subjected to the harsh conditions at the supermax facility in Florence, Colo., with its 24-hour solitary confinement, no family visits and lack of access to the media.Such a prison, the Irish court said, amounts to a breach of the constitutional requirement to protect persons from inhuman and degrading treatment and to respect the dignity of the human being.So on May 21, High Court Justice Aileen Donnelly set Damache free, after he had served his time on the lesser death-threat conviction and faced no additional charges in Ireland.Opened in 1994, the Colorado supermax prison is the toughest and most controversial correctional facility in the U.S. federal system.It is dubbed the Alcatraz of the Rockies, and has housed some of the nation's most notorious prisoners, including Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber; and Ramzi Yousef, the 1993 World Trade Center bomber. No one has ever escaped.Food is delivered through a slit in the cell door. Family visits are banned, conversations with others are restricted, and rarely, if ever, do inmates glimpse a tree or a bird through a window. They spend days and nights alone, their feet on concrete, their thoughts to themselves.It's considered so harsh that in recent years, defense lawyers have increasingly used the specter of the prison fortress to persuade jurors to vote against the death penalty and instead send their clients to supermax. They argue, in effect, that time there would be worse than capital punishment.In the 2006 capital murder trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the self-described 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks, prison expert James E. Aiken testified that inmates at supermax rot away. Moussaoui, he predicted, will deteriorate. The jury agreed and sentenced Moussaoui to life without parole at supermax.This May in Boston, defense expert Mark Bezy testified that Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, if spared the death penalty and sent to supermax, would be limited to two 15-minute phone calls with his family each month, and his mail would be screened.For the victims and their families, he would be forgotten, Bezy testified, calling supermax a mechanism to cut off an inmate's communications with the outside world.The jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death anyway. Though he was initially transferred to supermax, he will eventually be moved to federal death row in Terre Haute, Ind.The issue of solitary confinement has been raised in other formats too. President Obama, who last month became the first sitting president to tour a federal prison, wondered whether solitary confinement makes sense. Last month, Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said locking someone away all day and night exacts a terrible price.In the Damache extradition effort, U.S. officials argued there was no certainty he would end up in supermax, and they denied allegations of mistreatment. But they said harsh conditions are necessary to ensure that convicts do not continue to run criminal operations from inside prison.Kenneth Fulton, unit manager at the prison, offered a rare glimpse of supermax when he told the Irish court in legal documents that the prison houses less than one-quarter of 1% of all the federal inmates in the U.S.Christopher Synsvoll, supervisory attorney at the penitentiary, said that as of August 2014, 407 inmates were kept there — out of the total 207,504 in the federal system.Jennifer A. Williams, lead assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia in the Damache extradition effort, is coordinating with Justice Department officials in Washington to challenge the Irish ruling. We are exploring the possibility of an appeal, said spokeswoman Patricia Hartman.In her 333-page decision, the Irish justice said there is compelling evidence the Colorado prison is inhumane, citing affidavits from human rights groups and other records.I am satisfied, Donnelly said, that prolonged exposure to involuntary solitary confinement exacts a significant physiological toll, is damaging to the integrity of the mind and personality, and is damaging to the bodily integrity of the person.She further noted that Damache already had completed a three-year prison sentence in 2013 in Dublin for the separate Irish charge. He was held until the U.S. extradition request was adjudicated.Damache was indicted in Philadelphia in 2011 along with the three others on charges of plotting to assassinate a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet Muhammad as a dog.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-extradite-supermax-20150809-story.html,

Think about that.,"March 14, 2017 (PregnancyHelpNews) -- In recent remarks to the Citizens Assembly in Ireland, Dr. Peter McParland, an ob-gyn at National Maternity Hospital, pointed to a sign of things to come.“In Iceland,” the doctor said, “every single baby—100 percent of all those diagnosed with Down syndrome—are aborted.”The horrors of the statement above can scarcely be grasped. Iceland has become the first nation to boast of eradicating Down syndrome from its country.Dr. McParland expounded on this systematic annihilation stating, “There hasn’t been a baby with Down syndrome born in Iceland in the past five years.”Iceland is not alone in its aspirations to create a “Down syndrome-free” world. The holocaust of Down syndrome babies is a global epidemic, taking the lives of human beings created in the image of God on the basis of a prenatal diagnosis indicating Down syndrome.Denmark follows closely behind Iceland and predicts it will be a “Down-syndrome free” nation in the next 10 years.Meanwhile, 90 percent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in the womb are aborted in Great Britain and the United States.Among the many reasons these statistics are so tragic is that some babies diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome are born without the condition, while in other cases, doctors who fail to recognize markers for Down syndrome through prenatal testing are open to shockingly titled “wrongful birth” lawsuits.Even assuming all diagnoses are correct, exactly who are we eradicating from our planet?NBC News points to studies showing the following:Statically the vast majority of people with Down syndrome are happy, satisfied, and affectionate members of society—something that couldn’t be said of people born without the disability.Down syndrome does not have to be a death sentenceAs our world increasingly devalues life to the extent of attempting (and in some cases, succeeding) to cleanse the world of anyone who may have a disability, Heartbeat International’s 24-7 contact center, Option Line is standing against these cultural forces.The urgent need for Option Line, and the many pregnancy help organizations connected to Option Line, increases daily.Click like if you are PRO-LIFE!In January, alone, Option Line consultants answered a total of 23,660 calls, texts, emails and live chats from women and men seeking help during an unexpected pregnancy.One of those calls came from a woman pregnant with twins and desperately seeking help. Her doctor had just delivered the devastating news: Your test results are positive for Down syndrome.The woman felt alone, confused and conflicted on what to do next. It was her first pregnancy and she had not anticipated receiving such news. In most cases, medical professionals would urge this woman to consider terminating her pregnancy through abortion.Instead, Option Line’s highly trained consultant was able to offer her hope and practical help.The Option Line consultant explained that no matter what the outcome of her pregnancy, support was available. She was able to connect the frightened mother to a local pregnancy help center immediately.The Option Line consultant ended the conversation by praying with the mother. By the end of the call, the mother felt assured and courageous as she faced the future.It is never easy for a parent to receive devastating news during a pregnancy. But the overwhelming majority of parents who have a child with Down syndrome report their outlook on life is much more positive because of their child.The value of a child born with any disability cannot be eradicated by any nation. They are created in the image of God.That’s no less true in Iceland and Denmark than it is in Ireland and the U.S. And it’s no less true based on a person’s chromosome count.Reprinted with permission from Pregnancy Help News.",https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/babies-with-down-syndrome-deserve-love-not-eradication,

The nurse on duty cried. I don't think anyone said anything at all positive, says Sally Phillips. It wouldn't have been any different if they'd told me my child wasn't going to make it.Her son, Olly, was 10 days old, when he was tested for Down's syndrome - the results came back positive. But Phillips - the actress and screenwriter best known for her roles in Miranda and Bridget Jones - found life with a child with Down's syndrome was not what the hushed tones and apologies had led her to expectI was told it was a tragedy and actually it's a comedy. It's like a sitcom where something appears to go wrong but there's nothing bad at the end of it.She describes life in her family as just slightly funnier than in other families, thanks to Olly, who is now 12 and goes to a mainstream secondary school. She also has two younger children, neither of whom have Down's.Having Olly in my life has changed me and my family for the better. He has slightly worse impulse control but that means that it's very funny because he's often saying exactly what everybody's thinking but is too shy to say.He's also incredibly caring. He's the only one of my three kids who every single day will ask me how my day was. He's really kind. He's really focused on other people. He's really gifted emotionally. He'll notice if people are upset when I won't.Sally Phillips explores the issues around the new prenatal test in A World Without Down's Syndrome at 21:00 on Wednesday 5 October on BBC Two.In the UK, about 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome every year and there are an estimated 40,000 people in the country living with the condition.Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, but people with Down's have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which means they develop differently and have varying levels of learning disability. Some children with Down's have few health problems, but certain medical complications - such as heart, gut, hearing, or thyroid conditions - are more common in people with Down's.The current NHS screening, which is offered to all pregnant women, gives an indication of the likelihood that a baby will have Down's. If the foetus has the condition, there is an 85% to 90% chance that the existing test will pick it up, but about 2.5% of positive results are false and these babies don't have Down's.At the moment, the next step is amniocentesis or CVS (chorionic villus sampling), the only diagnostic tests that can definitively show whether a baby has Down's syndrome. Both of these tests are invasive - a needle is used to take a sample of the fluid surrounding the baby or cells from the placenta - and come with a risk of miscarriage. It's a risk some women are not willing to take.This is where NIPT - the new non-invasive prenatal blood test - comes in. It could soon be offered to women as an extra, second step in the screening process. It is 99% accurate and carries no risk of miscarriage.So the false positives will be identified earlier and fewer invasive tests carried out.That sounds good - but some people, including Sally Phillips, worry it will mean that more foetuses with Down's will be identified and aborted.NIPT is already available in private clinics. One woman in her 20s who used it to find out that her baby had Down's syndrome met up with Phillips to talk about her experience.After a positive NIPT test she went ahead with an invasive test which confirmed the result.It was her first pregnancy. Unsure of what life for the child would be like, she and her partner did some research online looking at news reports, videos of people with Down's and support group websites.Rather than the clinical research and a doctor saying, 'This is what it will look like,' what I was more interested in was family stories, she says. They found a lot of positive and inspirational testimonies, but some were troubling.There were blogs by mums so you see some of the difficulties that people are going through. There was one woman, her five-year-old's still not walking and he's very heavy and she's having to deal with him having fits everywhere, she says.If my child was affected as much as he was I would feel really guilty about that having been given the choice. Even the best case scenario isn't what I want for my son.So she and her partner decided to end the pregnancy. We felt that was the best thing for the baby, she says.For Phillips it can be difficult to accept that someone doesn't want a child like hers.And she is worried that her son will grow up in a world where more parents choose not to give birth to babies diagnosed with the condition. She gives the example of Iceland, where almost everyone screens for Down's and 100% of women who have a positive diagnosis now terminate.Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella, whose aunt had the condition, took a series of portraits of people with Down's to raise awareness of the Down's community there.But in the UK about a third of pregnant women opt out of screening, so if that remains the case, any of these babies who have Down's will continue to go undetected until they are born.In the UK the new test is being developed by Lyn Chitty at Great Ormond Street Hospital - professor of genetics and foetal medicine.She carried out a study to see what women do when they are offered NIPT. Based on this research she believes that an extra 195 babies with Down's could be diagnosed in England and Wales each year before birth.But even though 90% of women in the UK with a positive Down's diagnosis have abortions, she doesn't believe it means most of these 195 pregnancies will be terminated.I really do not think that we are going to be screening out Down's syndrome, she says. I find it quite distressing. I had a journalist phone me up and say 'You're going to annihilate Down's.' Well, I don't think that's going to happen.The trouble is everybody's looking at hypothetical scenarios, they're looking at 'what if' situations.We found that a lot of women were using the NIPT test to find out whether their baby's got Down's syndrome, inform themselves and carry on with the pregnancy. If you look at our statistics it will not significantly change the live birth rate.The statistics relating to terminations are complex and interpreted differently by each side of the debate. But all experts agree that the way a diagnosis of Down's syndrome is presented can influence whether parents choose to continue with the pregnancy.The whole essence of a good screening programme is the counselling you have before you even have the blood test done or the scan done, says Alan Cameron, foetal medicine consultant at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow.You've got to be given an educated choice, but certainly my experience is that much fewer women would terminate now than they ever did before because I think things are better… people see Down's kids having good, healthy, lives, working in the community, you see kids around with Down's syndrome that are doing a good job.In the early 1980s life expectancy for a child born with Down's was 25 years, but today it's about 60, with some living into their 70s. And a report published in 2014 shows how employers can benefit from hiring staff with Down's.Screening has never been a case of let's try and eradicate Down's syndrome from the population, says Cameron. That's never been the mission... It was all on the back of women's choice.He admits, though, that while medics have long considered the ethics and consequences of screening among themselves, they haven't been very good at discussing this with their patients and the public.This is where the Nuffield Council on Bioethics comes in. While the government gets ready to announce the roll-out of NIPT across the NHS, the council has been speaking to scientists, doctors, policy makers, people with Down's and their families to assess what impact it could have.There has been screening for Down's Syndrome for decades, so in terms of the enterprise of offering women informed choice NIPT doesn't really change that, says Tom Shakespeare, chairman of the Nuffield working group, which plans to publish its report in February.But it does open the door to testing for other conditions.It could be used by people who have a single gene condition, like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy or achondroplasia - my own condition, he says.Ultimately you could have whole genome sequencing so you could test that sample for everything - it's the next step and because NIPT is non-invasive you're not going to risk the foetus.And for him, like Sally Phillips, it comes back to how results and information are given to prospective parents.I support the option of screening for those that want it but it needs to be on the basis of good quality information - why are prospective parents not being given the full information about Down's syndrome?It's not just about trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) or risk of intellectual disability - it's also about what are people's lives like? What barriers do they face? Do they suffer? If you're potentially having a baby with a condition, that's what you want to know - how will it affect my family? How will it affect my child? How will it affect their life? How much of a problem is it?These are questions the new blood test is not able to answer.Karen Gaffney is a 38 year-old American woman with Down's syndrome. Last year she gave a TED talk on why her life matters. This is an edited version of her speech - you can watch the full version here.I would like to start by telling you about my fifth grade teacher. It was her first year of teaching when I showed up in her class. She didn't know anything about Down syndrome but that didn't matter, because she knew I wanted to learn, and she wanted to teach. She and I have stayed in touch. A few years ago, I got a special letter from her - she told me that she was pregnant and she needed my help, because her baby would be born with Down syndrome!She pushed back on any discussion of termination because she knew Down syndrome from a completely different perspective than her doctor did. She taught him about her fifth grade student... me!There was a time when people like me were institutionalised. When I was born, the doctor predicted that I would be lucky to be able to tie my own shoes or write my own name - he forgot to mention the part about me swimming the English Channel.We have begun to see more and more young people with Down syndrome graduating from high schools, some going on to higher education and learning employable skills. There are accomplished musicians, artists, golfers, models, actors and public speakers, as well as good employees making significant contributions to their companies and communities. These are all role models for what can be done in spite of one extra chromosome.It's far from perfect, though, breakthroughs haven't come for everyone and we still have battles to fight for inclusion.And it seems the race is on to find newer, faster ways to test for that extra chromosome before birth - the problem is without timely and accurate information, about all our progress, if the test shows an extra chromosome, pregnancies are being terminated. We have those who say we shouldn't even be born at all.I believe Down syndrome is a life worth saying yes to. Every life matters regardless of the number of chromosomes we have.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37500189,

In fact, some nations have already succeeded in eradicating pre-born Down syndrome babies, while others, including the United States, are close.Iceland has become the first nation to boast of total destruction of in-utero Down syndrome children. Obstetrician-gynecologist Peter McParland praised the move, according to Life Site.In Iceland, the doctor said, every single baby—100 percent of all those diagnosed with Down syndrome—are aborted, he said, adding, There hasn't been a baby with Down syndrome born in Iceland in the past five years.The United States isn't far behind. Up to 90-percent of mothers who learn they are pregnant with a child with Down syndrome choose to abort it.This high number of abortions in the U.S. and elsewhere are because of a simple, new blood test that detects Down syndrome. The test is non-invasive and can be performed early in pregnancy. Therefore, many, if not most, women have it.Before today's non-invasive blood test, the test to determine whether an unborn child had Down syndrome, by comparison, was rarely performed. Called an amniocentesis, it was invasive and could have damaged, even killed, the baby. It was performed in the later stages of pregnancy and involved inserting a needle into the mother's placenta to extract amniotic fluid.Today, the reason so many women choose to abort their Down syndrome babies is because they believe their child's life is not worth living. However, parents of Down syndrome children say that's not true. For example, when Cherry Jensen gave birth to a Down syndrome baby, she recalls how her doctors vastly underestimated how high her daughter would function. Now Cherry uses her daughter's story to convince other women to keep their unborn Down syndrome children. There are many stories of people with Down syndrome who are successfull in business, sports and other endeavors, even modeling.According to a study of parents of children with Down syndrome:According to a study of people with Down syndrome over age 12:7 MYTHS about people with Down syndrome:",http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2017/march/world-down-syndrome-day-celebration-marred-by-hococaust-in-iceland-elsewhere,

Correcting this common misconception matters both in providing accurate information to pregnant women and in normalizing the experience of receiving a child with Down syndrome.Last week, the American Journal of Medical Genetics published a study about the birth rates of babies with Down syndrome in the United States. The study estimates live births of babies with Down syndrome from 1900-2010, with a focus upon the effect of prenatal screening programs within the United States on the population of babies with Down syndrome. After factoring in the expected number of live births, miscarriages, and stillbirths, it then posits a “reduction rate.” This reduction rate demonstrates the number of babies with Down syndrome that are not born as a result of selective abortion.To be specific, in 2006-2010 theses researchers estimate around 5,300 babies were born with Down syndrome annually. During this same time period, approximately 3,100 babies with Down syndrome were selectively aborted each year. Around 800 of those aborted babies would have died before birth, so without selective abortion, the researchers estimate there would be around 7,600 live births with Down syndrome. The reduction rate of babies with Down syndrome in the United States in 2010 was around 30 percent. In other words, without selective abortion, the number of babies born with Down syndrome in recent years would have been about 30 percent higher than it actually has been.So why is this study important?First, it establishes a baseline of how many pregnancies with Down syndrome ended as a result of selective abortion before the advent of new non-invasive prenatal screening tests (“NIPT”) came on the market in 2011. The new tests offer greater accuracy in detecting pregnancies in which the baby has trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), and they do so earlier in pregnancy than previous screening tests. Before these tests, about 70 percent of pregnant women pursued some prenatal screening. With these new tests, more and more pregnant women may decide to avail themselves of the information offered through these tests, which may lead to a greater number of abortions. This data will allow help provide an understanding of the effect of these new tests on the selective abortion rate.Second, however, this study also demonstrates that the majority of women carry babies with Down syndrome to term. Here’s where it gets a little confusing. A screening test (and this is true even of the new NIPT tests) simply provides a prediction about whether or not a child will have Down syndrome. The only way to determine a diagnosis with near certainty is through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, both of which remain invasive procedures with some measure of risk to the baby. Amniocentesis is the most reliable diagnostic tool, and it cannot be performed until around 16 weeks.Here’s where the confusing and oft misreported statistics come in. Studies have shown that women who receive a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome through amniocentesis (who make up two percent of the population of pregnant women) generally seek an abortion 90 percent of the time. Still, the majority of women do not seek diagnostic information about their baby’s chromosomal makeup, and the majority of women do not abort their babies with Down syndrome. It’s possible that they don’t abort simply because they don’t know they are carrying a child with Down syndrome. But it is just as likely that they decide against having that information not out of ignorance but out of a commitment to their baby.Third, the recent study demonstrates the role that culture plays in women’s decisions about prenatal testing and abortion. When compared to other countries, the United States’ reduction rate is quite low, comparable only also to the Netherlands, where the reduction rate for the population with Down syndrome is around 35 percent. Australia, by contrast, has a reduction rate of 55 percent, and the United Kingdom of 48 percent.This study also demonstrates significant regional differences within the United States. Women in the Northeast are the most likely to choose to terminate their pregnancy, with a reduction rate of around 46 percent, whereas women in the rest of the country have a reduction rate of anywhere from 25 to 30 percent. More research is needed to determine what cultural factors contribute to these decisions—Is it the way medical information is presented? Does it correlate with religious commitments? What role could churches, doctors, and other community members play in demonstrating the positive possibilities for children with Down syndrome within our current society?We don’t have the answer to these questions, but this study demonstrates that culture matters when it comes to creating an environment hospitable to babies with Down syndrome. For those of us who care about supporting parents who are making decisions about prenatal screening and diagnostic tests, for those of us who care about receiving children with Down syndrome into this world with celebration and gratitude, this study provides important information and hope.The last thing a pregnant woman facing the likelihood of a baby with Down syndrome needs is to think that keeping that baby is an abnormal choice. This study demonstrates that carrying babies with Down syndrome to term and receiving them into families and communities is the norm within the United States. It also demonstrates that cultural values affect the choices women make about prenatal screening and about prenatal tests. We all can contribute to sustaining and creating a culture in which people with Down syndrome are welcomed and valued. Thankfully, many parents are already making the choice to bring these babies into the world and offer us all the gift of their presence.If you liked this blog post and want to read more, subscribe to my newsletter, follow me on Twitter @amyjuliabecker, or check out my Facebook author page.

Other people working in the field agree. But many pregnant women seem to assume otherwise.Fewer and fewer babies with Down syndrome are being born.In European countries it is estimated that roughly nine out of ten women decide to have an abortion if they are told they are carrying a child with Down syndrome.It's become almost routine for pregnant women to screen for Down syndrome, especially among women who get pregnant in their late 30s and early 40s.And it's become quite easy to find out whether your unborn baby has trisomy 21.A non-invasive prenatal test can analyze a mother's blood for an embryo's DNA. The test screens for the probability of the embryo having trisomy 21. If the probability is high, the mother can then elect to have an amniotic fluid test for a more precise reading.This relatively new non-invasive screening method is much more precise than earlier tests, which combined a blood analysis with an ultrasound test.The availability of these tests is said to have led to an increase in abortions among women carrying babies with trisomy 21.But Gert de Graaf of the Dutch Foundation Down Syndrome says that trend was already seen with earlier - less precise - screening tests.That's because in 2003 Dutch authorities decided every pregnant woman in the Netherlands should actively be informed about the option of screening, using the combined blood analysis and ultrasound test. Since then, says de Graaf, fewer babies with Down syndrome have been born.De Graaf points out, however, there are many parents who do not want to participate in the screening program because they simply don't want to know. For them, trisomy 21 is not a reason for abortion.Only about one third of pregnant women in the Netherlands decide to screen for trisomy 21. And yet about twice as many children with Down syndrome would be born if there were no abortions.Now, with the more precise, non-invasive blood tests becoming widely available, even more pregnant women may chose to screening for Down syndrome, and the concern is that this could lead to a greater increase in abortions. But we don't know that yet, says de Graaf.Different from country to countryA look at EUROCAT, a database for European surveillance of congenital anomalies, reveals that numbers in Germany are similar to those in the Netherlands.About 50 percent of babies thought to have trisomy 21 are simply not born - as their parents terminate the pregnancy.The number of children born with Down syndrome seems to depend on the number of pregnant women who participate in screening.Take Denmark, for example. There, Down syndrome screening is free-of-charge. About 90 percent of pregnant women get it done. There is even a subtle social pressure to do the screening, suggests de Graaf. And as a result, almost no children with Down syndrome are born in Denmark.The situation is a little different in the US, where abortion is not widely accepted. Abortion is legal but it remains a divisive issue. Studies suggest  that about 67 percent of pregnant women in the US decide to have an abortion if their unborn has trisomy 21.Why have an abortion?Why have an abortion?Each year approximately 3,000 to 5,000 children are born with the chromosome disorder, according to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). Among the effects are hearing, heart and intestinal problems.Parents may worry about life with a child with Down syndrome, says Florian Steger, a medical ethicist at Ulm University. They may worry about how to raise their child or the stigma in society. Steger says it's time for society to act.We mustn't leave mothers alone and without help, he says.Life expectancy among people with Down syndrome has risen dramatically in the past decades. The WHO says about 80 percent of people with Down syndrome now live to their 50th birthday and beyond. But some parents may still worry about who will look after their child when they themselves get older or die.Steger says it is every woman's right to decide whether to screen for trisomy 21, and whether she wants an abortion.But he says it's also a woman's responsibility to get properly informed so that she can make her own decision, without blindly following the advice of others, whether it's a doctor's, her mother's, or from someone else.De Graaf also says he hopes more people will get better informed about Down syndrome and life with a child born with it.Down syndrome is less of a disaster than people think it is, he says. I would not consider it a reason for abortion. But, he says, it's a decision that people have to be able to make for themselves.The older you getThe chance of having a child with Down syndrome is about 1 in 200.Older mothers - beyond 30 or even 35 years of age - have a much higher risk than younger mothers.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the number of babies born with Down syndrome between 1979 and 2003 increased by about 30 percent.This is probably due to the fact that many women are having babies later in life.And perhaps that is why more women feel a need to screen for trisomy 21, and that as a result, more are also having abortions.And, yes, it has to be said, a child with Down syndrome is a lot of work, says Gert de Graaf.Life is different with a trisomy 21 child, he says.",http://www.dw.com/en/would-you-have-an-abortion-if-you-knew-your-baby-had-down-syndrome/a-38041648,

He told Quijano, We have basically eradicated, almost, Down syndrome from our society.After being asked what it means for Iceland as a society that the nearly all women choose abortion after Down syndrome diagnosis, Stefansson responded that it is a result of genetic counseling.And I don't think that heavy-handed genetic counselling is desirable, Stefansson told CBS. You're having impact on decisions that are not medical, in a way.The head of the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit and Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland, Hulda Hjartardottir, said in her interview with Quijano that by suggesting women get tested for genetic abnormalities, like Down syndrome, they could be directing people toward abortion.We try to do as neutral counselling as possible, but some people would say that just offering the test is pointing you towards a certain direction, Hjartardottir told CBS.With the spread of these diagnostic tests in Iceland, as well as the increase in accuracy since their introduction in the early 2000s, nearly 100 percent of women in Iceland choose abortion following a positive prenatal testing for Down syndrome.In the United States, more than 67 percent of women who are told that their unborn child may have Down syndrome choose an abortion, with some organisations reporting a higher number, 85 to 90 percent.However, states are starting to enact laws that prohibit abortions due to genetic abnormalities, race, sex, or ethnicity. In 2013, North Dakota banned abortion due to fetal genetic anomaly and since then, other states such as Louisiana have passed similar laws, with more states trying to do so.Through a social media campaign, the March for Life organisation is asking CBS to air a segment about the happiness and benefits Down syndrome children bring to families, according to a tweet by March for Life president Jeanne Mancini Aug. 15.In an interview with Catholic News Service on 16 August, Mancini said that while the CBS story said that Iceland is eliminating people with Down syndrome, it is far worse.We would say that they are eradicating people with Down syndrome, Mancini said.Mancini pointed out that while approximately 20 percent of the US population is aborted, the number of people with Down syndrome who are aborted is frighteningly disproportionate.Studies have shown that between 85 and 90 percent, depending on which reports you use, of these special little ones who are diagnosed with Down syndrome are terminated, Mancini said. We are moving in the direction of Iceland.Emmy award-winning actress Patricia Heaton tweeted on 14 August in response to the CBS report: Iceland isn't actually eliminating Down syndrome. They're just killing everybody that has it. Big difference.A 2011 Harvard study by Brian Skotko, Susan Levine and Richard Goldstein examined the self-perception of people with Down syndrome ages 12 and up. Among the 284 people surveyed, 99 percent of people with Down syndrome were happy with their lives, 97 percent liked who they are and 96 percent liked how they look.Ultimately, the study concluded, the overwhelming majority of people with Down syndrome surveyed indicate they live happy and fulfilling lives.While many women may feel pressured to choose abortion following a diagnosis of Down syndrome, groups such as the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network guide expectant mothers through the parenting process as well as offer resources to those who choose to place their child in an adoption program.There are so many people who want to adopt children with Down syndrome, Stephanie Thompson, director at the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network, told CNS in an interview on 16 August.Thompson, who is the birth mother of a child with Down syndrome, offers counselling to families who receive prenatal diagnoses, offering them updated, positive information to parenting.On average, about 50 families sit on the registry at the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network just waiting to adopt.It is incredible to me that a country is terminating a life that people are praying for, that they want to include in their family, they want to take care of, and they value so much, Thompson said. They went through a home study process, fingerprints, background checks. They had people coming in and inspecting their home and it took three months and thousands of dollars to do this.While the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network currently only offers adoptions within the U.S., Thompson is positive that there are families in countries around the world who are waiting to adopt children with Down syndrome as well.If there was a program like ours in every country, I can just see that termination rates would drop, Thompson said.PICTURE: A woman walks along a street in Reykjavik, Iceland, 15 June.

Pro-life Senator Frank LaRose (R-Hudson), sponsor of the bill, testified on behalf of the legislation, explaining how abortions are disproportionately performed on babies with Down syndrome.“Abortion has to be one of the most tragic forms of discrimination we can imagine,” said Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life. “None of us are perfect, yet babies with disabilities continue to be targeted for elimination based on the notion that some babies are simply better than others. We are all created equal and should be protected as intrinsically valuable members of our one human family.The legislation comes in response to studies which show that 90 percent of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. The practice of aborting children based on a Down syndrome diagnosis has been hailed as a victory in European countries like Denmark where 98 percent of babies with a positive diagnosis are aborted and in Iceland where 100 percent are aborted. Last year, a French court banned a pro-life commercial featuring smiling children with Down syndrome on the basis that it could disturb the conscience of women who had aborted their unborn children.“The only word for this kind of search-and-destroy mission is eugenics,” said Gonidakis. “History has shown us the dark path of this kind of de-humanization. If diversity, inclusion and compassion mean anything in 21st century America, we will pass this legislation and stand up for our friends with disabilities, born and unborn.

The doctor who performs the abortion, however, would be held responsible and could receive a fourth-degree felony charge. Officials could fine the doctor and even prevent the physician from continuing to practice medicine, according to the Associated Press.“[Doctors] tell you of these horrific things that can happen [with a Down syndrome baby] … the different anomalies, cardiac issues … I really feel like you’re given a death sentence,” Ohio nurse Kelly Kuhns told the Associated Press.Kuhns, 36, received a positive test for Down syndrome during her fourth pregnancy and now has a 2-year-old son with Down syndrome. Her son, Oliver, has led a “pretty normal life,” according to the news agency.Kuhns supports the legislation and has testified before lawmakers in favor of the bill.“We were told of all the different therapies [Oliver] would need and all the additional work that would be involved,” she said. “But we were never told how amazing our lives would be with Oliver in it. Nobody told me my face would hurt from smiling at him.”CBS News touted the fact that few countries “have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,” and reported that almost all women in this country who receive a positive test for the disease abort their child. After the CBS News report from mid-August, lawmakers accelerated the Ohio bill, according to state Sen. Frank LaRose, one of the bill’s sponsors.“Some of the sweetest, kindest people I know have Down syndrome,” said LaRose, a Republican. “It’s just very unsettling for some of us that people in our society are going to make a decision that this life is worth something and this life is not worth something based on this genetic abnormality.”Aborting babies because a child has Down syndrome is “a modern-day form of eugenics,” said Dennis Sullivan, a physician and bioethicist at Cedarville University, the Associated Press notes. As of 2015, France had a 77 percent termination rate and Denmark a 98 percent termination rate for unborn Down syndrome babies.In the United Kingdom, 90 percent of pregnant women with a positive Down syndrome test receive an abortion, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.Others in the medical profession don’t agree and fear that if the law is passed it won’t stop abortions but will prevent doctors and patients from sharing information with each other.“These ‘reason bans’ represent gross interference in the patient-physician relationship, creating a system in which patients and physicians are forced to withhold information or outright lie in order to ensure access to care,” said Mark DeFrancesco, the 2016 president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Indiana and North Dakota have similar laws to the bill under consideration in Ohio. Indiana’s law, however, has been blocked by a federal judge who ruled the court cannot prevent a woman from getting an abortion based on particular reasons.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It’s a frightening number but is it accurate?I’m no longer comfortable saying so. A statistic like that carries enormous weight when prenatal tests come back and the parents’ dreams of a perfect baby come crashing down. If 90 percent of parents who already walked a scary mile in their shoes chose abortion, it must be the best decision. Right?The truth is I can’t find good support for that number in the United States. The 90 percent statistic surfaced in 1999 in Europe, where countries track prenatal diagnoses of birth defects and subsequent abortion. The US doesn’t collect that information, and estimates here have been all over the map.Now the Jerome Lejeune Foundation has released a new study that gives us solid data. A dozen states do track live births of babies with Down syndrome. Researchers used that information and data about abortion after prenatal testing to devise a new estimate of how many babies with Down syndrome were likely aborted. The model showed that such abortions have reduced the US population of people with Down syndrome by about 30 percent.But that doesn’t mean 30 percent of babies with positive tests for Down syndrome were aborted. That number reflects a reduction in the population we’d expect to be living with Down syndrome, regardless of when it was diagnosed. The key is a related study in 2012. It used a mathematical model to estimate that 67 percent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in the US are aborted. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.2910/abstractWhy are these two studies important? Jerome Lejeune was the French geneticist who first identified the cause of Down syndrome, the first researcher to link an intellectual disability to a genetic cause. The foundation bearing his name is as renowned for defense of human life as it is for the rigor of research it funds. It provides no funding for research that uses tissue from abortions. While we still have to rely on statistical models, the stature of the Jerome Lejeune Foundation USA goes a long way toward answering the question, how many babies with Down syndrome are lost to abortion in the US every year?Sixty-seven percent is still a startling number. Any number is too high. But it’s a distance away from 90 percent. It says a prenatal diagnosis isn’t the end of every dream but the beginning of a different dream of unexpected joy. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington has an eight-year-old son named Cole who has Down syndrome. She chairs the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus, and here’s what she said at a recent event honoring the life of Jerome Lejeune:“[Cole’s] playing baseball, basketball, doing horseback riding, and you know, we often look back and wonder why we were crying so much when we first got that news, because Cole has brought us so much joy. “It doesn’t mean that there aren’t hard days, but his impact on our lives has been a total positive, and I am a better person, a better legislator, and most excited to be a part of the disabilities community, specifically the Down Syndrome community.”But 67 percent also means we have to do a better job of talking about the joy and other many blessings, because otherwise the number will likely go up.Hundreds of thousands of pregnant women routinely undergo prenatal screening every year. Manufacturers bill their tests as “99% accurate, simple and trusted,” and “near-perfect,” with “simple, clear results.” They also bill hundreds of thousands of dollars every year; tests range in cost from $795 to $1,495.Their claims aren’t independently verified. The tests aren’t approved by the FDA. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR) found that screening companies are “overselling the accuracy of their tests and doing little to educate expecting parents or their doctors about the significant risks of false alarms.” By the testing industry’s own studies, the tests for chromosomal conditions like Down syndrome can be false-positive half the time. Half the time. And the more rare the condition, the higher the false-positive rate.Screening tests are just that—screening tests. A diagnostic test like amniocentesis is more certain but poses a risk to the baby’s life. Sadly, some women are aborting their babies based solely on the screening. One company’s own research showed 6.2 percent of women with high-risk test results aborted without a follow-up diagnostic test. At Stanford University, NECIR turned up three women who aborted completely healthy babies based on screening results. One of them actually had a diagnostic test too, but when it came back negative she aborted her baby anyway. She was so sure the screening was right.Of course I don’t believe an abortion is warranted under any circumstance.Please help us spread the word that Down syndrome isn’t the end of the world. Expecting parents are frightened, which is totally understandable, but with time, true information and support they can see beyond their first fears.

We try to do as neutral counseling as possible, but some people would say that just offering the test is pointing you towards a certain direction.”Other “progressive” European countries are not far behind Iceland in Down syndrome “termination” rates. As of 2015, France was unburdening itself of 77 percent of potential Down syndrome babies annually, while Denmark has nearly matched Iceland at 98 percent. And in the United Kingdom, 90 percent of women who receive a positive Down syndrome diagnosis “terminate” the lives of their pre-born babies.Meanwhile, in the United States the estimated abortion rate is around 67 percent (according to statistics between 1995-2011) when Down syndrome is detected.Commenting on the nearly 100-percent abortion rate for pre-born babies identified as potentially having Down syndrome, geneticist Kari Stefansson said the campaign “reflects a relatively heavy-handed genetic counseling. And I don't think that heavy-handed genetic counseling is desirable.... You're having impact on decisions that are not medical, in a way.” He added that while “I don't think there's anything wrong with aspiring to have healthy children … how far we should go in seeking those goals is a fairly complicated decision.”As for the morality of the “eradication” campaign, Helga Sol Olafsdottir, who counsels expectant mothers who may be carrying a baby with Down syndrome, said that in her country “we don't look at abortion as a murder. We look at it as a thing that we ended. We ended a possible life that may have had a huge complication, preventing suffering for the child and for the family. And I think that is more right than seeing it as a murder, that's so black and white. Life isn't black and white. Life is grey.”But there is an alternative perspective that is being ignored in Iceland's eradication model. “Iceland sounds like they are proud of the fact that they've killed nearly all unborn babies that had an in-utero diagnosis of Down syndrome,” said Peggy Nance of Concerned Women for America. “This is not a medical advancement. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best. These individuals have no less worth than anyone else.”Added Nance, “What is the next headline going to be? That a certain country has eradicated all females? Oh wait, China has already been down that road. There is no limit to this train of thought of devaluing human life.”Kristan Hawkins of the pro-life group Students for Life of America told LifeSiteNews.com that “my heart breaks for the innocent babies aborted in Iceland because society has deemed certain people undeserving of life. My children with genetic disabilities are loved and valued the same as my children without. I pray this report will wake up the people of Iceland to the discriminatory killing occurring amongst them. I pray they wake up before even more human beings fall victim to this disgusting mindset.”Commenting on the CBS report, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson said, “I have rarely seen a story that so closely resembles Nazi-era eugenics.” Added the respected pro-family and pro-life leader, “The Bible tells us that 'we are all fearfully and wonderfully made.' I know countless parents who would say the same of their own children with Down syndrome. A child born with a chromosome defect is a child made in God's image, fully capable of living a happy, productive, and healthy life. They are as capable of giving and receiving love just as you and I are. They deserve a chance to live — and those of us in the Church must speak out on their behalf.”",https://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/faith-and-morals/item/26722-nearly-100-percent-of-icelandic-mothers-abort-down-syndrome-babies,

Since there’s evidence that the decision to abort can vary by region, we think it’s an overstatement for Santorum to say that after prenatal diagnosis, ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."" There are no standardized, national numbers, so his use of the term ""in America"" is problematic.",Rick Santorum says,"During an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation on Feb. 19, 2012, Rick Santorum got into a lengthy discussion of prenatal issues with host Bob Schieffer. We’re looking at two claims from that exchange; but here we’re focusing on here is that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.     Let’s first look at the context of Santorum’s claim.     Referring to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio, Schieffer said, You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all.     Santorum responded, Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.     First, let’s recap what PolitiFact Florida found when it checked a similar claim in April 2011 that came up during a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives.     Republican state Rep. Richard Corcoran said -- and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates publicized it on Twitter -- that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted.         Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion.     The story did not say specifically where the statistic came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion.         We searched and found other studies that showed similar percentages.         A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent.         That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here).         However, in additional research for this article, we’ve found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried.  In a joint statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies.     No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists, the statement said. Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives.  ACOG suggested we talk to Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. He emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors.  In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so, Evans said. In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent in some cases.  We also located a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine, titled Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome. The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that almost 100 percent of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity.  First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics, the paper said. Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities.     Our ruling     A number of scientific studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent -- close to what Santorum said -- but all have been localized. Since there’s evidence that the decision to abort can vary by region, we think it’s an overstatement for Santorum to say that after prenatal diagnosis, 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted. There are no standardized, national numbers, so his use of the term in America is problematic.

Well, we don’t know. While new data suggesting lower numbers has recently been published,[1] we continue to see most often in print a statistics of 90% – 92%. While that certainly draws attention to the horrifying reality that the majority of children prenatally diagnosed with DS are aborted, it is not accurate. That number relies on a 1999 European study with little data drawn from the U.S.[2] There are good reasons for advocates to use the best data available to raise awareness of the problem that exists in the link between prenatal diagnosis and abortion.A new study conducted by Gert de Graaf, Frank Buckley, and Brian Skotko and recently published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics[3] applies rigorous statistical modeling to diverse data sets in an attempt to provide the most accurate number possible. It is important to know over time what impact relatively new noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) technologies, only available since October 2011, will have on the already high termination rate after a prenatal diagnosis of DS.These new NIPS tests are able to identify cell-free DNA from the placenta in the mother’s blood as early as 10 weeks into her pregnancy, and claim to inform women – with near 99% sensitivity and specificity – if the baby she is carrying might have DS.  Recent reports have indicated that some women are using these tests to make the decision to end their pregnancy without having the result confirmed with an invasive diagnostic test.[4] To understand the impact this new technology will have over time on birth rates of children with DS, it is essential to establish a benchmark that can be used for future comparison.Unlike the U.S., some countries track birth defects in national registries along with prenatal diagnosis and termination rates, so there are little or no vagaries around this question. For example, the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register (NDSCR) is a part of the larger British Isles Network of Congenital Anomaly Registers.[5] Both of these are part of EUROCAT, the broader European network of population-based registries that compiles epidemiological data on congenital anomalies across Europe. The NDSCR collects information on all diagnoses of trisomies 13, 18, and 21 in England and Wales. With a few clicks of a mouse, anyone can access the database and learn the prevalence, prenatal detection rates, and other key public health indicators related to genetic anomalies.For example, using information gathered from all member registries, from 2008 to 2012, there were 4,288 live births of children with DS, 231 natural fetal deaths, and 5,215 terminations. DS live births as a percentage of total diagnosed pregnancies was 44%. Fifty-three percent of all pregnancies were aborted following prenatal diagnosis and a small percentage were lost to natural causes. We can also learn that during the same four-year period, 65.1% of the total DS cases were prenatally diagnosed.[6]In the United States, we have no such data collection. And given how polarized we are as a nation around the topic of abortion and the strong value placed on the right to privacy, there is little chance that this level of data collection will ever be possible.The authors of this study gathered data that is available and devised a sophisticated statistical model to estimate as closely as possible the impact of prenatal diagnosis on abortion rates. They then asked this question:  How many children with DS have been born, and what has been the net effect of pregnancy terminations following prenatal testing on live birth prevalence during the period from 1900–2010? Given that prenatal diagnosis and legal abortion weren’t available before about 1974, the authors focused on the years from 1974 to 2010 to develop their estimates.In brief, the answer to their question is that for the most recent years, 2006–2010:The net result of their research is that abortion after prenatal diagnosis has reduced the population of individuals living with DS in the U.S. by approximately 30%. This should not be confused with the percentage of women who abort following a prenatal diagnosis. That number would certainly be higher. This reflects the overall reduction in the DS population, and takes into consideration total DS pregnancies, whether prenatally diagnosed or not. The authors state that prior to October 2011 and the availability of NIPS, about 72% of women elected to have traditional prenatal screens and only an estimated maximum of 2% went on to have invasive diagnostic procedures, i.e., amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. If prenatal screening becomes more widely available, as seems to be happening, then one would expect the number of terminations to increase.As an interesting aside, the authors estimate the total case prevalence of DS in the U.S., excluding elective termination and natural loss, to be 1 in 365. This number correlates closely with the reported live birth incidence of DS in the Arab world where abortion for DS is not permitted. The birth prevalence in Dubai is estimated at 1 in 449 overall, but much greater among the Emiratis: 1 in 319.[8]In this publication, the authors have identified regional and racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of abortion following prenatal diagnosis by drawing data from 12 states that maintain live birth data of DS births by racial/ethnic group. The group with the highest number of terminations was Asians/Pacific Islanders (61%) followed by non-Hispanic whites (39%), non-Hispanic blacks/Africans (27%), Hispanics (18%), and American Indians (16%). Regionally, Hawaii and the Northeast states have the highest termination rates compared to other regions of the US at 62% and 46%, respectively. The South is the lowest with an overall reduction rate of approximately 23%.The authors of this study have provided valuable baseline data that should help frame the discussion of the impact of prenatal diagnosis on future termination rates.The fact that there have been no clear-cut statistics in the U.S. regarding how many women receive a prenatal diagnosis for DS, their subsequent decision regarding birth, termination, or adoption is frustrating. It is equally frustrating that there is no accurate census of the population living with DS in the U.S. Another statistically based study published in 2013 revised the estimated population of those living with DS in the U.S. in 2008 from a previously estimated number of 400,000 to around 250,000 – that represents a 25%–40% reduction in population that could substantially impact services and supports, and also potential funding made available for research.Using the statistic of 90% or 92% when citing abortions of babies with DS indeed presents a horrifying scenario, but in truth so do the numbers derived from more recent and presumably accurate surveys. DS advocates should consider the impact using old and inaccurate data might have on those considering their options following a prenatal diagnosis of DS. Hearing that 90% to 92% of parents opt for termination might have the opposite effect from what advocates desire and even encourage those who would consider abortion after a prenatal diagnosis.Advocates would be far better served by using the statistics provided in this new study, i.e., that it is estimated that abortion following a prenatal diagnosis of DS results in a 30% reduction in overall DS births. Jamie Natoli, et al., proposed another statistic that correlates well with this study. In a 2012 publication in Prenatal Diagnosis, their research calculated a weighted mean across the U.S. of a 67% termination rate following prenatal diagnosis.[9]Whatever the statistical realities may be, the number of those who choose abortion after a prenatal diagnosis  is far too high. It should be none. To paraphrase the recently deceased disabilities rights activist, Dr. Adrienne Asch, the only thing prenatal diagnosis can provide is a first impression of who a child will be. Making such a radical decision as to end the life of a child based upon a first impression is a most horrible and violent form of discrimination. It has no place in an American society that is committed to ending discrimination in any form and that has intensified that effort for persons with disabilities over the last 25 years since the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act in July 1990.Mark Bradford is president of the Jérôme Lejeune Foundation USA.[1] Jaime L Natoli, et al.

It is a National Right to Life article by Lauren Bell. It is entitled “Babies with Down Syndrome Deserve Love, Not Eradication.”Lauren writes that “In recent remarks to the Citizens Assembly in Ireland, Dr. Peter McParland” pointed out that “in Iceland…every single baby—100 percent of all those diagnosed with Down syndrome—are aborted.” One hundred percent. As such, “Iceland has become the first nation to boast of eradicating Down syndrome from its country.” Moreover, “Denmark follows closely behind Iceland and predicts to be a ‘Down-syndrome free’ nation in the next 10 years.” In addition to all of that, “90 percent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in the womb are aborted in Great Britain and the United States.”That of course raises a very serious question. What makes a Down Syndrome baby less valuable than a proposed designer baby? The answer is this: one is not less than the other. Both are created in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27), and that should make all the difference in the world. The imago Dei insures that a Down Syndrome child must be afforded the very same dignity that we give to a distinguished scientist; of course, the imago Darwinii leads in quite another direction.I wrote about this in Has God Spoken? The point being amplified by none other than the late Stephen Jay Gould, one of the most prominent Darwinian theologians on the planet. He observed that the highly regarded evolutionary notion of recapitulation — this of course is the idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny —served as a basis for Dr. Down labeling Down Syndrome as “Mongoloid idiocy.” Why? Because he thought it represented a throwback to the Mongolian stage in human evolution. As Gould said, the term “Mongoloid” was first applied to mentally defective people because it was then commonly believed that the Mongoloid race was, well, not yet evolved to the status of the Caucasian race. Thankfully, Stephen Jay Gould decried recapitulation’s responsibility for the racism of the post-Darwinian era. In his words, “Recapitulation provided a convenient focus for the pervasive racism of white scientists; they looked to the activities of their own children for comparison with normal, adult behavior in lower races.”Anyway, I was reading the article, and as I was reading the article, I was just stunned to think that this is the condition we find ourselves in today, a condition in which people no longer regard the image of God in humanity as sacred. I actually took the time to watch the video (mentioned in the article). I think it was 29 minutes. It was memorable time. It was chilling to hear Dr. Peter McParland speak in clinical fashion about having Down Syndrome–free babies. As we all know statistically, the vast majority of people with Down Syndrome are happy, satisfied, and affectionate members of our society. To discriminate against them is simply chilling and unthinkable, and yet we see once again how ideas have consequences.God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27 NIV).This blog is adapted from the March 7, 2017, Bible Answer Man broadcast.",http://equipblog.wpengine.com/love-not-eradication-what-down-syndrome-babies-deserve/,
Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world.,http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/jun/17/david-beckham/david-beckham-says-swaziland-has-worlds-highest-ra/,True,True,True,True,Unrelated,True,"Swaziland, a small landlocked country in southern Africa, has the highest HIV prevalence in the world, with 27.2% of their adult population living with HIV.",HIV and AIDS in Swaziland,"Swaziland, a small landlocked country in southern Africa, has the highest HIV prevalence in the world, with 27.2% of their adult population living with HIV. In 2016, 8,800 people were newly infected with HIV and 3,900 people died of an AIDS-related illness.HIV and AIDS has had a devastating impact on Swaziland. According to 2015 estimates, life expectancy in the country is 57 years for men and 61 years for women. However, over the last decade Swaziland has done well to curb its HIV epidemic. At 79%, they have one of the highest rates of antiretroviral treatment coverage in sub-Saharan Africa, and they have also increased their own investment and funding for the HIV response.Overall, HIV prevalence in Swaziland is stabilising. HIV incidence has decreased from 2.5% in 2011 to 1.8% in 2013 and the number of HIV-positive infants born to HIV-positive mothers also decreased from 12% to 3% between 2011 and 2012 . Nevertheless, the huge amount of people living with HIV in Swaziland means it is still the country’s biggest public health concern.Heterosexual sex is the main mode of HIV transmission in Swaziland – accounting for 94% of all new HIV infections. Low and inconsistent condom use, intergenerational sex, transactional sex, gender inequalities, gender-based violence, multiple and concurrent sexual relationships and a low uptake of male circumcision are all key drivers of Swaziland’s HIV epidemic. However, certain groups are more affected than others.Women are disproportionately affected by Swaziland’s HIV epidemic. Of the 220,000 people living with HIV, 120,000 are women. In the context of the entire population, 31% of all women are living with HIV, compared to 20% of men.HIV incidence for women increases dramatically between the ages of 15-19 and 20-24. This sharp increase has been attributed to the high level of intergenerational sex that occurs between older men and young, sexually inexperienced women. Around 14% of women aged 15-24 years had sex in the last 12 months with a partner who was 10 or more years older. The rate of women aged 15-24 who had high risk sex with men who are 10 or more years older than them doubled from 7% in 2006/7 to 14% in 2010.Around 12% of women aged 15-49 years are in a polygamous marriage. Females getting married at a younger age is also fairly common; 9% of women now aged 20-49 were married by the time they were 18, and 1.3% were married by the age of 15. Gender based violence and abuse is also commonplace. One in three women report experiencing some form of sexual abuse by the time they were 18, 79% of whom knew the perpetrator. These outcomes put woman in a subordinate role in society, resulting in early sexual debut and difficulty negotiating condom use. All of these factors increase their risk of HIV.Swaziland’s Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Bill has been passed by parliament for several years yet has still not been signed into law by King Mswati III. This lack of political commitment could be a result of deep social norms that view issues such as early marriage and gender equality as taboo.In Swaziland, around 24% of children aged 0-17 years are orphans and 45% are either orphans or vulnerable. Around 47,000 of orphans will have lost their parents due to AIDS related illnesses.The impact of so many AIDS-related deaths in Swaziland exacerbates existing poverty for families, resulting in a very youthful population. Around 38% of the population are aged under 15 and only 5% are aged 60 or over. With such high HIV prevalence amongst the most productive working age ranges, responsibility for the care of orphans and vulnerable children often falls upon older generations such as grandparents.Estimates suggest that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (sometimes referred to as MSM) in Swaziland is 17.7%.Data about men who have sex with men in Swaziland is limited, and there are few programmes specifically targeting them. Sex between men is also illegal, and there has historically been little appetite by the government to address this group’s needs or acknowledge men who have sex with men exist. As a result, only 27% of men who have sex with men were reached with targeted HIV prevention programmes in 2013, the most recent data available.[pdf]A study conducted by USAID found that 25% of men who have sex with men also reported having sex with women in the last year – meaning there is a heightened risk HIV may get transferred to the general population. Although the study found knowledge about condom use and HIV to be high, only 18% knew of the heightened risk of HIV from anal sex, and only 21% had ever been reached with information on sex between men.Stigma and self-stigma are also major issues. The study found almost two-thirds of men who have sex with men were scared to reach out to healthcare workers due to their sexual orientation.Swaziland has the highest HIV prevalence among sex workers in the world. An estimated 60.5% are living with HIV.Data on female sex workers is limited. A 2014 study by the Johns Hopkins Centre for Global Health found 40% of female sex workers had an average of six partners per week.The study found condom use to be high but inconsistent. Around 83% reported using a condom they last time they had sex with a regular client. However, 69% also reported having sex without a condom in the past six months. Lower condom use was reported with non-paying partners than in commercial sex.Although a third of women reported anal sex in the last month, only a tenth were aware this was put them at heightened risk of HIV. Rape was common with nearly 40% reporting at least one rape and 17% reported being raped six or more times. More than a quarter (29%) reported having been to jail or prison, and slightly more than 5% reported injecting drug use in the past 12 months.In recent years, the number of people testing for HIV has rapidly increased. In 2009, just 16% had tested for HIV and knew their results in the past 12 months. By 2014 this had risen to 66% of women and 54% of men.Swaziland has made big steps to expanding access to HIV testing and counselling (HTC) in the country. At the end of 2003, just 13 sites providing were voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in the country. In 2006, Swaziland introduced a provider-initiated approach to HTC, this is when medical staff offer an HIV test rather than waiting for someone to ask for one. By 2014, 83% of all health facilities were providing HIV testing, and over 60% of all HIV tests given were provided-initiated. Community based testing is also increasing. In 2015, the government launched a self testing pilot scheme, enabling people to test for HIV at home.In 2015, 79% of people living with HIV in Swaziland were receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). The year before, Swaziland adopted World Health Organisation guidelines that anyone diagnosed with HIV should be started on ART regardless of their CD4 count (which indicates the level of HIV in the body). This means thousands more people are eligible for treatment than before.ART has been free in Swaziland since 2003. The country’s ART programme is entirely funded and procured by the government, without help from international donors.Between 1992 and 2010, HIV prevalence among pregnant woman increased from 4% to 41%. As a result, prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) was scaled up and viewed as a vital entry point for accessing HIV services for the entire family.Some improvement has been seen, with HIV prevalence among this group standing at 37% in 2013.  In 2015, less than 500 children (aged 0-14 years) were newly infected with HIV, compared to 1600 in 2010.In 2016, UNAIDS reported that 95% of pregnant women living with HIV received antiretroviral treatment. Around 64% of children (aged 0-14) living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment.The scale-up of PMTCT has involved expanding PMTCT implementation in health facilities and at the community level. By 2013, 162 healthcare facilities out of a total of 252 offered PMTCT services. Other interventions include the better involvement of men in services, strengthening antenatal care follow-up and engaging new-born infants with care.Given Swaziland’s generalised HIV epidemic and high HIV prevalence, voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) was adopted as an HIV prevention strategy in 2008 at the community level. Swaziland concentrated efforts on young men aged 15-24, where HIV prevalence was lowest for males.Circumcision rates have risen from 7% in 2007 to 25% in 2014 However, this is far below the country’s 2013 target to circumcise 80% of men.Despite around 90% awareness of circumcision, and some increase in uptake, the need to still use a condom and a fear of pain have been given as reasons not to be circumcised. A belief in witchcraft in Swaziland is also an issue – with some men believing their foreskin may be used for ‘ulterior motives’.In 2015, Swaziland had the second highest level of availability of male condoms in the region, with 51 condoms available per man per year. This is well above the United Nations Population Fund’s regional benchmark of 30 male condoms per man per year (2011–2014).According to 2014 data, the most recent available, 66% of women and 83% of men aged 15 to 49 years with multiple sexual partners in the last 12 months used a condom the last time they had sex. This shows a significant increase from 2007, when only 56% of women and 48% of males used condoms with every high risk sex.Safer sex practices were even higher among younger people with 70% of women and 93% of men aged 15-24 using a condom the last time they had sex with a non regular partner.An estimated one in every 100 people develops active tuberculosis (TB) in Swaziland each year. The country has a dual epidemic of TB and HIV, with 80% of all people who have TB also co-infected with HIV.To tackle the problem, Swaziland started a programme of strengthening and integrating TB/HIV services. These services have been decentralised, and are now offered in a ‘one-stop-shop’, where people can seek screening for TB and HIV testing, as well as being able to pick up their treatment for both at the same time. In 2012, over 90% of all TB patients were tested for HIV, and over 73% received treatment for both. From 2007 to 2013, the death rate from TB has decreased from 19% to 9%.Stigma associated with HIV and AIDS in Swaziland prevents many people from being tested for HIV or declaring their HIV status. HIV is perceived to be linked with sexual promiscuity, and often causes HIV-positive people to be excluded from family activities.It is thought that stigma associated with HIV discourages people from testing. In 2012, the Ministry of Health conducted a national survey into HIV. It found 68% of women who tested HIV-positive were already aware of their status. However, around half (48%) of men who tested HIV-positive were not.Those living with HIV will often keep it a secret, some even from their sexual partners. There is evidence that this is changing slowly – with the recent increase in HIV testing linked to a decline in HIV-related stigma. Despite this, a 2014 survey by Swaziland’s Central Statistical Office found 37% of women and 36% of men displaying discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV. The 2011 Stigma and Discrimination Index found self-stigma among people living with HIV remains high.Swaziland is a patriarchal society with high levels of gender inequality. Men often dictate women’s reproductive and sexual health, and child marriage and polygamy are practised. The subordinate status of women can also place them at an increased risk of sexual violence and low access to education and health information.Inter-generational relationships are common. High unemployment is a factor in this as some young women may have sexual relationships with older men (often called ‘sugar daddies’), from whom they may receive money or gifts. This is sometimes referred to as transactional sex. The age and gender imbalance in these situations can make condom negotiation difficult.Access to HIV services and treatment can be hampered by the existence of traditional health practitioners (THPs), who many people in Swaziland visit. However, many organisations, including the World Health Organisation, argue that THPs should be better recognised as primary healthcare providers so that they can become more closely involved in the delivery of effective HIV services.Same sex relations and sex work are both illegal in Swaziland, with both groups reporting high levels of human rights violations against them. Around one-third of men who have sex with men and female sex workers report some form of legal discrimination. More than a third (37%) of female sex workers report being refused police protection. A third (36%) of men who have sex with men report being tortured due to their sexuality.In recent years, Swaziland has made great progress in tackling HIV – particularly around the areas of treatment, PMTCT and reducing HIV incidence overall.However, the high HIV prevalence among the general population means the government will need to tackle many of the social and cultural problems that hamper the response. These include poverty, gender inequality and risky cultural practices that contribute to a high risk of HIV infection among the general population.Effective prevention initiatives and a greater focus on improving access to HIV testing facilities are also urgently needed. The epidemic among key affected populations – particularly female sex workers and men who have sex with men – needs to be addressed. The government needs to work harder to collect data and understand the complex needs of these groups, so that adequate HIV programming can be developed. The dual epidemic of TB and HIV remains a cause for concern.",https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/swaziland,

Over the same period, rates of HIV viral load suppression – a marker of effective treatment and reduced infectivity – doubled. These data show that targeted HIV service delivery by the Government of Swaziland, CDC through PEPFAR, and other partners in recent years is yielding dividends.The PHIAs are national surveys – implemented under the leadership of Ministries of Health and by PEPFAR, CDC, and ICAP at Columbia University – providing direct measurement of progress toward global targets to control the HIV epidemic. These complex surveys combine house visits, in-person interviews, HIV testing, and cutting-edge technologies, including in laboratory science and diagnostics. The data from Swaziland draw from two large household surveys directly measuring new HIV infections and viral load suppression at two periods, in 2011 and 2016.“CDC plays an essential role in the global HIV response by ensuring that programs rapidly respond to new data for greatest impact,” said CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D. ”These findings show a dramatic transformation in Swaziland where, at one time, HIV was destabilizing family structures, communities, and its economy.  CDC’s commitment as a longstanding stakeholder in the global HIV response, working side-by-side with ministries of health on evidence-based programs, has helped transform some of the world’s most severe HIV epidemics.”Swaziland not alone in progress fighting HIVThe Swaziland findings add to results from PHIA surveys released in December 2016 from three other PEPFAR-supported countries that also showed strong progress toward epidemic control. PHIA results from Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe found that 87 percent of people diagnosed with HIV were on treatment, and nearly 89 percent of those on treatment were virally suppressed.“Results from Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe clearly show that our efforts, through PEPFAR, and, in concert with partners are working,” said Rebecca Martin, Ph.D., director of CDC’s Center for Global Health. “As a key partner in PEPFAR, CDC supports countries’ sustained responses to their HIV epidemics, as well as to other global health threats, ultimately protecting the health and economic well-being of America and the rest of the world. Today’s investments in controlling the global HIV epidemic will save lives and costs into the future.”“These groundbreaking findings from Swaziland show that we are making strong progress toward controlling the HIV epidemic in the country with the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world,” said Ambassador Deborah L. Birx, M.D., U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. “Combined with the results from three additional PEPFAR-supported surveys that we released last December, we now have clear evidence that four African countries are approaching control of their HIV epidemics using the 90/90/90 fast track strategy.”Together, the four PHIA surveys also help the global community focus on who still needs to be reached to control the HIV epidemic. These data shine a light on the specific populations and geographic areas that remain unreached and require urgent attention and services. For example, young people – especially adolescent girls and young women – are less likely to know their HIV status and seek services. In Swaziland, the SHIMS2 data also revealed that men ages 20 to 35 years need access to tailored treatment and prevention services, such as evening and weekend clinics and targeted outreach in communities.PHIA survey findings have already helped Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe focus resources on urgent program priorities.About CDC CDC works 24/7 saving lives and protecting people from health threats to have a more secure nation. Whether these threats are chronic or acute, manmade or natural, human error or deliberate attack, global or domestic, CDC is the U.S. health protection agency. HIV and TB are the world’s two most deadly infectious diseases. The two epidemics are tragically interconnected, as TB is the leading cause of death for those living with HIV. CDC’s Division of Global HIV & TB works with partners to tackle these two epidemics and to produce the greatest global health impact.

By providing technical assistance to national entities and civil society organizations, the Joint Team ensured better access to HIV services for all, especially  children and adolescents, as well as enhancing the coordination and sustainability of the HIV response.The Joint Team provided technical support to the Government for the adoption of the 2015 WHO HIV Treat-All guidelines and the development of the road map for rollout of the guidelines. The Joint Team also contributed to increased access to HIV testing services (HTS), through support to the roll out of test and offer guidelines; development and piloting of self-testing standard operating procedures and communication materials; and provision of HTS services to children and adolescents, leading to over 400 000 children, adolescents and adults getting tested in 2016.Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) was enhanced through the establishment of teen clubs in seven health facilities, with 546 adolescents living with HIV as members (including 340 females). To promote retention and adherence to ART, the Joint Team also supported the development of a training curriculum for expert clients and the training of 300 expert clients who were deployed in facilities and communities. Their inputs included mobilizing and providing treatment literacy; implementation of the Food by Prescription (FbP) programme, reaching around 22 000 ART/tuberculosis (TB)/prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) clients and their households; and a review of guidelines for nutrition support services. Technical support was also provided in forecasting to inform procurement of HIV supplies and commodities in line with the new guidelines. This support contributed to reaching approximately 167 000 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART.Contributing to enhanced viral load suppression, the Joint Team supported an assessment of viral load testing to inform scale up and advocated for procurement of more viral load testing machines, which have been distributed to five health facilities in all four regions. To strengthen TB/HIV integration, the Joint Team supported a Gender Assessment, to empirically ascertain the current status of the dual epidemic (TB and HIV) and the national response from a gender perspective, for better informed programming. The Joint Team further provided technical support to monitoring and evaluation of collaborative TB/HIV activities, as well as the adaptation of the End TB strategy and refurbishment of the Matsapha Central Correctional Centre isolation unit for infectious diseases control, especially TB.Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, WFP continued to implement the FbP approach in main health facilities across the country, targeting PLHIV and TB clients, among others, with specialized nutritious food (SNF) for a limited period of time. A total of 3511 malnourished PLHIV and TB clients were provided with the SNF. They were also provided with monthly household rations consisting of maize, pulses and vegetable oil. This approach aimed at assisting the clients to cope with the costs of care and increase the likelihood of them being retained on treatment programmes. A total of 21 066 beneficiaries were reached with the household ration.Political and community mobilisation for prevention in Swaziland was enhanced through a Youth Prevention Dialogue, where 500 young people shared ideas on Ending AIDS. An improved service delivery proposal for youth was also developed, informing Swaziland’s participation in the 2016 High Level Meeting on AIDS.In 2016, the Joint Team supported the roll out of the life skills education (LSE) curriculum to 255 secondary schools reaching 706 760 students. They also developed and printed an LSE handbook, conducted orientation sessions among secondary school principals and trained 1685 teachers. More than 9000 parents were also sensitised on LSE curriculum content. Support by the Joint Team on the preparation of the country report and participation of a Swaziland high level delegation to the ESA Ministerial Commitment progress review meeting additionally bolstered advocacy for mainstreaming comprehensive sexuality education (CSE).The Joint Team trained 100 nurses on adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, improving access to services and information. Furthermore, more than 37 000 youth were reached with SRH information and services through mobile services and cultural events, and 33 928 through a social media campaign. Support to the “CONDOMIZE” campaign held during Bush Fire festival resulted in the distribution of 600 000 male and 300 000 female condoms, and enhanced condom demand creation.Finally, to prevent HIV transmission in Swaziland, a voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) Strategy and VMMC services roll out were finalised in 2016 and a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) framework was developed.A National Strategy on Ending Violence (2016-2020) was developed to strengthen the multi-sector response to GBV. Furthermore, two national coordination mechanisms were launched, namely: the National High Level Task Force and the Multi-sectoral Technical Task Team on Violence.Ninety one children were provided with post-violence comprehensive treatment and care services in the One Stop Centre and access to post-violence treatment and care was improved through the creation of an additional One Stop Centre.  Sixty nine service providers were trained on GBV and clinical management of rape. Finally, a study on the extent of sexual harassment in the workplace was finalised and a web based online data collection and reporting platform was established.Coordination capacity of the National Emergency Response Council on HIV and AIDS (NERCHA) was strengthened through support towards the realignment and development of a corporate strategy and continuous engagement on HIV prevention leadership. Strategic planning and investment application was also supported, through the launch of an HIV Investment Case, which guided the long term vision of ending AIDS in Swaziland. The end of term evaluation of the Extended National Strategic Framework is currently underway.The Swaziland National Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (SWANNEPHA) was supported to improve its governance and access to Global Fund grants. Sector specific strategies were supported by the Joint Team to help guide and enhance the different sectors’ contributions to the national response.Technical assistance was also provided to review and adopt Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and to review and implement the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) improvement plan. With support from the Joint Team, funds from the Global Fund were reprogrammed to support key population prevention interventions and FbP for PLHIV. In response to the drought emergency, Swaziland was supported to guide the application of new grants under the 2017-2019 Global Fund funding cycle.Finally, striving for reliable data to inform decision making, an epidemiological and prevention response analysis was carried out, with the first phase of the exercise completed and a draft report validated. A conditional case transfer study was also supported, as well as a modelling exercise on PrEP implementation. Finally, to enhance knowledge sharing, the first National AIDS Conference was held in July 2016, with the Joint Team providing support in conceptualisation, planning and management.The Joint Team continued to support country consultations as part of advocacy for the development of social protection policy in 2016. For example, to contribute to impact mitigation, the Joint Team provided nutritional support to 50 000 orphans and vulnerable children attending neighbourhood care points (NCPs) across the country",http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/swaziland,
Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world.,http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/jun/17/david-beckham/david-beckham-says-swaziland-has-worlds-highest-ra/,True,True,True,True,Can not judge,Unrelated,,Swaziland makes major strides against its AIDS epidemic,"PARIS—New data from Swaziland, a tiny country in southern Africa, provide some of the most convincing evidence yet that aggressively ramping up treatment for HIV/AIDS works on a population level to cut the rate of new infections. The kingdom has had one of the worst HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world, but since 2011, its massive scale-up of testing and treatment has slashed the rate of new infections by 44%.Several studies have firmly established that when antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are taken consistently they drive the level of HIV in the blood down below the level of detection on standard tests. In response, the risk of an infected person transmitting the virus plummets. This led to the concept of so-called treatment as prevention, and mathematical models suggest that if 73% of a population suppresses their virus, new infection rates will nose-dive and epidemics can sputter out. But many questions remain about this theory, especially after a report last year showed that Botswana had come close to hitting this target without seeing much impact on its rate of new infections..New data presented here at the International AIDS Society’s (IAS’s) international conference show Swaziland, a landlocked country of 1.45 million people that’s bordered by South Africa and Mozambique, has made “remarkable progress,” said Velephi Okello from the country’s Ministry of Health in Mbabane. As Okello explained, a survey in 2011 showed that 32% of the Swazi population between the ages of 18 and 49 was living with HIV—the highest prevalence of any country in the world. At the time, only 72,402 of those people were receiving ARV treatment. Only 34.8% of the infected population had suppressed the virus. The rate of new infection, or incidence, was 2.5% per year.Today, 171,266 HIV-infected people in Swaziland receive ARVs, thanks to support from the U.S. government President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program (PEPFAR), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A 7-month survey, funded by the Washington, D.C.–based PEPFAR and completed in March, found that 73.1% of the infected population now has fully suppressed virus, and Okello said the HIV incidence had dropped to 1.4%—a 44% decrease. In addition to ramping up treatment, the country also has seen big increases in men opting to be circumcised, a proven way to lower the risk of becoming infected by the AIDS virus.The room erupted into hoots and applause. “These findings are cause for celebration,” says Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University whose group helped Swaziland conduct the surveys. “It’s a dramatic blunting of new infections.”“These are really beautiful data,” said Linda-Gail Bekker of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Bekker, who was not involved in the study, is also the president of IAS, which sponsored the meeting.PEPFAR Director Deborah Birx said the new data were rigorously collected. “The thing that’s so exciting about Swaziland is they had a very true baseline from 5 years ago with very similar methodology so you could go in there and see which parameters changed and which parameters didn’t change,” Birx says. She stresses that treatment as prevention by itself won’t eliminate HIV in Swaziland. “This is our way to contract the epidemic on our way to vaccine and a cure,” she says.Swaziland still faces serious challenges, Okello noted. Only 66.1% of HIV-infected people in the 15- to 24-year-old age bracket, know their status—far lower than the 84.7% seen overall—and of those, only 81.7% are receiving ARVs. More sobering still, about one-fourth of those receiving treatment in the younger group are not suppressing their infections. “They’re lagging behind,” Okello said.Michel Sidibé, head of the Joint United Programme on HIV/AIDS in Geneva, Switzerland, worked in Swaziland 25 years ago when the virus was just starting to make headway. “We saw the epidemic exploding in South Africa and the migration with Swaziland was so big I could see the big risk,” Sidibé says. But Swaziland was reluctant to promote education about sexuality and had a traditional, decentralized approach to the growing spread of the virus, he says. “The major, major breakthrough started coming when the current king understood it was a survival issue for his nation about 6, 7 years ago.”Sidibé says he hopes the U.S. government will take notice of the Swaziland success and recognize the importance of maintaining its substantial investments in PEPFAR and the Global Fund. (It’s the biggest single donor.) “The best news of this conference will be the Swaziland results,” Sidibé says. “The result should drive all our efforts.”Although U.S. President Donald Trump strongly supported PEPFAR while he was a candidate, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month alarmed many in the HIV/AIDS community when he testified at a U.S. Senate hearing about proposed budget cuts that could limit PEPFAR’s extensive reach. “The program monies that are available are to sustain the HIV treatments in 11 countries to continue to take those to conclusion,” he said.Birx says this was a misunderstanding. “That is totally my fault,” says Birx, explaining that she wrote a briefing paper that called for accelerating the PEPFAR effort in 11 countries. “We’re not leaving the other 50 countries that we’re in.",http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/swaziland-makes-major-strides-against-its-aids-epidemic,

The new data came from the second Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS2), a type of population-based HIV impact assessment (PHIA) led by the Swazi government and funded by the United States Presidents’ Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The program is also supported by the CDC and the International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Photo of Brenda Fitzgerald Brenda Fitzgerald “These findings show a dramatic transformation in Swaziland where, at one time, HIV was destabilizing family structures, communities and its economy,” CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, MD, said in a statement. According to Nkambule and colleagues, it was the first measurement of the impact that a national scale-up of HIV programs has had in Swaziland since the previous SHIMS1 survey was conducted in 2011. SHIMS2 included household-based, rapid HIV testing of 10,934 participants aged 15 years or older between August 2016 and March 2017. According to the new results, Swaziland has an HIV prevalence rate of 27% (95% CI, 25.7-28.3) and an incidence rate of 1.36% (95% CI, 0.92-1.81). Among adults aged 18 to 49 years, the HIV incidence rate was 1.39% (95% CI, 0.83-1.94) — a 44% decrease from the 2011 estimate. The incidence rate in women was higher than in men — 1.95% vs. 0.86% — but declined among both genders since 2011, 38% in women and 53% in men. Moreover, rates of viral load suppression among adult patients with HIV aged 18 to 49 years increased from 34.8% in 2011 (95% CI, 33.4-36.2) to 71.3% (95% CI, 69.0-73.5) during the survey period. The results in Swaziland followed recent findings from PHIAs conducted in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe that showed progress toward eliminating HIV in those countries. Deborah L. Birx, MD Deborah L. Birx “These groundbreaking findings from Swaziland show that we are making strong progress toward controlling the HIV epidemic in the country with the highest HIV prevalence in the world,” Ambassador-at-large Deborah L. Birx, MD, coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS and U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, said in a statement. “Combined with the results from three additional PEPFAR-supported surveys that we released last December, we now have clear evidence that four African countries are approaching control of their HIV epidemics using the 90-90-90 fast-track strategy,” Birx said. – by Gerard Gallagher",https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/hiv-aids/news/online/%7B4f70fd05-a6ab-4d40-9a4d-a9b4597b20ea%7D/swaziland-halves-rate-of-new-hiv-infections,

New HIV infections are declining and the HIV incidence rate among adults aged 18-49 is estimated as 2.38%, comprising of 1.7% and 3.1% amongst men and women, respectively (Swaziland Incidence Measurement Survey Study -SHIMS 2011).  According to the preliminary report of the Swaziland HIV Estimates and Projections (2012), the annual incidence rate among 15-49 years is expected to reduce from 2.9% in 2011 to 1.9% in 2015, and new infections among children at 18 months of age are estimated to be 11% of all exposed children in 2012 from 19.6% in 2009. At ages 6-8 weeks, the country has virtually eliminated mother to child infections. According to the SHIMS (2011) the peak incidence of HIV infections is borne by women aged 18-19, 20-24 and 30-34 and men aged 30-34. Both SHIMS and Estimates and Projections models support the evidence of declining HIV infections.The epidemic presents a gender disparity, with prevalence being higher in women (38%), compared to men (23%). Analysis shows that the HIV epidemic is stabilizing and shifting to older populations. Recent data from the SHIMS (2011) reveals huge prevalence reductions among the 18-24 year age group, comprised of a 54% and 20% reduction among males and females, respectively. Peak prevalence has shifted to older persons: to women aged 30-34 from those aged 25-29 in 2006/7; similarly for men, to those aged 35-39 from 30-34 year olds in 2006/7. HIV prevalence among female sex workers is very high (70%) and lower among men who have sex with other men (17%).The country faces a dual epidemic of HIV and tuberculosis (TB), where the risk of acquiring TB is between 20 and 37 times greater among people living with HIV. Over 80% of TB patients are also HIV positive and TB is responsible for more than a quarter of deaths among people living with HIV.  There are 1,380 per 100,000 incident TB cases occurring annually in Swaziland (World Health Organisation Global TB report 2012).  Swaziland is making strides in responding to the co-epidemics, with 66% TB/HIV co-infected patients receiving treatment for both in 2012, an improvement from 35% in 2010. There has been remarkable improvements in the TB treatment success rate from 68% in 2009 to 73% in 2012, although still below the WHO target of 85%.Swaziland is seeing a continued increase in drug resistant TB cases. Currently, between 7-10% of all new TB cases are multi-drug-resistant (Swaziland Drug Susceptibility Survey, 2010).Through implementation of the eNSF, Swaziland aims to achieve the following impact level results:a) 50% and 90% reduction of new HIV infections among adults and pediatrics, respectively, by 2015. b) Avert 15% deaths amongst PLHIV and in particular those with TB/HIV co-infection. c) Alleviate the socio-economic impacts of HIV and AIDS among vulnerable groups. d) Improve efficiency and effectiveness of the national response.",https://sz.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/pepfar/synopsis-epidemiology-hiv-aids-swaziland/,

The epidemic is showing signs of stabilizing and in recent years new infections rates have fallen. However, there’s a stark gender imbalance with respect to HIV incidence in Swaziland where women, especially young women, are much more vulnerable to the disease than men of the same age. FSRN’s Sam Cowie reports from Mbabane.Nokwanda Dlamini found out that she was HIV-positive when she was 14 years old. Nokwanda Dlamini is not her real name. She prefers to use a pseudonym in fear of repercussions from the rampant social stigma around HIV/AIDS in Swaziland.Her grandmother took her for an HIV test on a neighbor’s advice after she had been sick and off school for a year. At the time, she didn’t know how to tell her grandmother that she had been raped by her uncle while she was still in primary school.“When I got I was HIV positive – ah, the questions I got after then off my grandmother after,” recalls the young woman. “I couldn’t answer them because I was crying and I was confused too. Because she asked me ‘You are too young, you’re not supposed to have it, this virus,’ because they were lacking knowledge. She said ‘You’re too young! Where did you get it from?’ I couldn’t answer her.”According to a 2013 UNICEF report, one in three Swazi women suffers sexual violence before the age of 18.Now 21-years-old, Dlamini volunteers once a month at a local clinic that holds group therapy sessions for HIV-positive children and adolescents. Dlamini says that at the group, which she calls “teen club,” she can talk openly about her condition — something she can’t do at home.“Teen Club helps young people to live positive,” she says. “So it encourage us, it gives us strength to live with HIV and they give us love that we don’t get from home from our parents, from our relatives.Swaziland has the world’s highest incidence of HIV, affecting around 26 percent of the county’s 1.25 million people. Young women aged 24 and under are at least three times more likely to contract the disease than their male counterparts.Despite the prevalence of HIV in Swaziland, people living with the condition are still heavily stigmatized.Nolwazi Simelane was born with the virus and attends the same clinic as Nokwanda Dlamini. Like Dlamini, Simelane is not her real name, she prefers to keep her identity anonymous. Simelane says that in certain villages, people wouldn’t want to share a glass of water with her if they knew she had HIV.“I had a boyfriend, we dated for four years,” she says, explaining that having HIV complicates friendships and relationships and she is forced to keep her condition a secret. “On the fourth year, because I was afraid to disclose my status to him, but you always use protection and that stuff, but when I told him about my status, he said ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’ He went for a test three times and found he was negative and then he leave me. That hurt a lot because I loved him, and I thought no one would love me again.”HIV prevalence in Swazi women aged 18 and 19 is a staggering 14 percent and 31 percent for women aged 20 to 24 compared to just one percent and seven percent respectively for men the same ages.Widespread poverty and unemployment are major drivers of the epidemic as without economic empowerment young women are more likely to turn to sex to earn an income.In Swaziland, it’s common for young women to have transactional sexual relationships with older men known as “sugar daddies” who support them financially. Due to the nature of these relationships, condoms are not generally used.Male polygamy is frequently practiced in the country and women aren’t empowered to say no or insist on condom use with their husbands or partners.Hleli Luhlanga of Swaziland Young Women’s Network, an Mbabane based organization that advocates for young Swazi women’s rights, blames Swaziland’s highly patriarchal culture. She also says that sex education for girls at school is restricted until they are in their teens, by which time they are often sexually active.“It’s a variety of issues – one of them mainly being our culture” Luhlanga explains. “Women are sexualized from a young age. It’s a patriarchal culture where women don’t have decision making rights over their own bodies. And also access to information.Since 2010, new HIV infection rates have fallen gradually in Swaziland thanks to increased access to testing and medicine from outreach work, as well as successful prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) interventions.But critics say that Swaziland’s official HIV response is failing to address the epidemic’s gender imbalance with few programs aimed at girls and young women. Analysts and international aid institutions like UNAIDS say that without addressing core drivers like poverty and cultural norms, young women will remain much more vulnerable to HIV infection than men.",https://fsrn.org/2015/05/swaziland-has-worlds-highest-hivaids-rate-young-women-most-affected/,

The clinic is visited by about 850 people per month and provides comprehensive primary health care services including diagnosis and treatment for many of the common ailments in Swaziland. It is also one of 14 clinics throughout the country participating in the innovative Maximizing ART for Better Health and Zero New HIV Infections (MaxART) program.Led by the Swaziland Ministry of Health, the MaxART program began in 2011 with the goal of reducing new HIV infections and improving access to treatment throughout the country. In Swaziland, which has the highest rate of HIV infection of the world, 31 percent of the adult population (aged 18-49) are living with the disease. Timely diagnosis, high-quality treatment, and follow-up care are critically needed to keep patients healthy and to limit the spread of HIV/AIDS.CHAI is proud to have been a founding member with Aidsfonds (formerly STOP AIDS NOW!) of the MaxART consortium—which includes community representatives, government partners, and academic institutions—and part of a team striving to alleviate the burden of HIV in Swaziland.The initial phase of the MaxART consortium’s work dramatically improved HIV diagnosis and linkage to care. The subsequent phase expanded into a pioneering implementation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a “Test & Start” approach to providing treatment for HIV. “Test & Start” is an innovative practice that begins antiretroviral therapy (ART) for everyone living with HIV, regardless of their disease progression. Studies show that the earlier patients begin treatment, the better they do and the less likely they are to pass their infection to others.A young girl examines medications her mother has received through the MaxART program (Photo Credit: Claudia Beretta)By early 2017, the study (which is expected to continue through August 2017) had enrolled around 3,000 people through clinics like Hhukwini , helping Swaziland better understand the practical feasibility of implementing “Test & Start” within the national health system.Swaziland adopted “Test & Start” as the national policy in October 2016. The data collected continues to be used by Swaziland’s Ministry of Health to ensure practical challenges to the newly adopted “Test & Start” approach can be addressed and the potential benefits to both individual health and a national reduction in incidence of new HIV infections can be fully realized.Since 2014, clinics like Hhukwini have successfully identified and started treatment for thousands of patients, saving many lives and better informing the implementation of the program nationwide.Not only is the project helping Swaziland to achieve its ambition to end AIDS by 2022, but the lessons learned can be generalized beyond Swaziland to other resource-constrained settings to improve the global response to end the spread of HIV/AIDS.",https://clintonhealthaccess.org/preventing-hivaids-in-swaziland/,

We find out why.,"This series looks at the effort to stop rising HIV rates in young women and girls.There, public health officials are working to control the transmission of the disease in a new population of young people.According to a report from the NGO Avert, “poverty, the low status of women and gender-based violence (GBV) have been cited as reasons for the disparity in HIV prevalence between genders, with GBV attributable to an estimated 20–25 percent of new HIV infections in young women.”South Africa is home to one of the highest rates of rape in the world. The law changed in 2007 to include a better definition of rape, which previously had only covered vaginal penetration of a woman.We’ve got to address the sexual violence in our country because that is really driving HIV in this country, says Marlene Wasserman, the host of a popular talk radio show where Wasserman answers questions as Dr. Eve. One of the things we know is that a contributor towards men raping, is if they themselves were survivors of trauma, or victims of trauma, or if they themselves have witnessed trauma.While not a perfect comparison, the United States had a rate of 38.6 rapes per 100,000 people in 2015, also a significantly higher rate than most other countries in the world. Rates in South Africa are falling, but are still so much higher than the rest of the world.You’ve got people who are economically, absolutely, absolutely poverty stricken, and powerless, Wasserman says. And so when you have that, as a foundation of men who are powerless, and not able to provide for themselves or a family, there’s a huge amount of anger that happens. And when there’s a huge amount of anger, there’s a huge amount of violence. Male-on-male violence is huge in this country. And it’s expanded into male-on-female violence.But there’s another factor that also is playing a major role in South Africa’s HIV problem.Researchers say young women are at a greater risk because of early sexual activity and relationships with older men who are already HIV positive.“Instead of having relationships with their age cohort, they were having relationships with men about seven to eight years older, who are already HIV positive,” Birx says. “It was the age differential that really resulted in the [higher] risk factor to young women.”In some cases, this relationship is characterized by the use of the social hashtag #blessed. In South Africa, a “blesser” is an older, wealthier man who can “bless” a younger woman with gifts.“The Blesser culture is nothing new,” explains Nolwazi Mkhwanazi, a medical anthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who has studied teenage pregnancy in many communities in South Africa. “It used to be called transactional sex; it used to be called intergenerational sex.”That intergenerational sex is a driver of HIV infections in young women. The older men often have HIV and then pass the disease on the young woman.“These blessers are high risk men,” Wasserman explains. “These are men who are probably married, and they’ve got multiple partners. And they’re not using condoms.”But the rise of smartphones and camera phones has changed the practice.“It’s happening literally in my phone and all around me,” says Lebohang Masango, 26, who is writing a dissertation about the blesser culture. “It’s very possible that blessers were always around, but it’s just now — because of the highly narcissistic quality of Instagram — we get this insight into how these people are living.”Masango says the use of #blessed on Instagram exploded in South Africa in December 2015. Being #blessed is similar to having a “sugar daddy,” but with differences.“When the whole blessers thing exploded, it was about the sheer obscenity of the wealth,” Masango explains. “It was insanely wealthy. Many people are not accustomed to the levels of luxury consumption that were being displayed, especially from relatively unknown young women on social media.”Some women who seek out blesser relationships are from South Africa's middle class and already have some money to buy clothes and makeup to attract a blesser, Masango says.Sandton (a wealthy neighborhood in Johannesburg) is the richest square mile in Africa, Masango says. It has beautiful restaurants, beautiful nightclubs, a lot of the time when these relationships are solidified, it happens because they met in these areas. You have to have access to that money to begin with. You have to spend money for a blesser to look at you and say, 'I want her on my arm, I want to take her to Dubai.' Jokes are even made about how to tell how serious a blesser is. A cartoon in South Africa shows levels of blessers. A level one blesser can buy a girl phone credit; a level five blesser takes her on vacation to Dubai.“[The blessee] wants the three C’s: she wants the cash, the credit card, and the car,” Wasserman says.For her research, Masango has been seeking out women who defy the stereotypical blesser relationships.“One young woman, she uses Tinder in order to meet older men,” Masango says. “She’s incredibly firm in her beliefs and very unapologetic about how she feels about being compensated for her time in romantic relationships. 'You pay for my time, you’re paying for my attentions'. She’s studying engineering so she could be studying and spending her energies on herself at a particular time so he must pay for her time and her emotional labor if she will be spending that time with him, instead. She just does this because it’s fun and she refuses to engage with men in ways that are not materially beneficial to herself. That already is a break from the dominant narrative.”Masango says the women she has met in her research are older — in their early and mid-20s and speak responsibly about HIV prevention.“The young women I’m studying with really [have] amazing sexual health practices,” she says. “They test before they sleep with anyone. They insist on condoms. They are the people — all of those advertisements — it reached them and it resonates and it works in their lives. They protect themselves even as they’re doing something as risky as having multiple concurrent partner sex.”Masango’s research matches what PEPFAR has been finding.Birx, with PEPFAR, says surveys have shown that young women know about HIV, but not all the education efforts seem to work.“The young women had incredible knowledge about HIV, but none of them believed they were at risk for getting HIV,” she said.Still, anthropologist Nolwazi Mkhwanazi says talking about sex is a really hard thing to do in South Africa.“Even though sex ed is part of life, life orientation, teachers, especially in rural areas, find it very difficult because of cultural ideas of who has the right to speak about sex and when,” Mkhwanazi says. “It's very different to teach sex education, including ideas around contraception. They can't get this information from nurses and hospitals either because of the same ideas.”HIV officials use something called 90-90-90 or the HIV cascade to describe their plan for defeating the disease.It’s an approach to curbing the epidemic that tries to bring down the rate of infection and, over time, eradicate the disease. The goal: 90 percent of people living with HIV know their status; 90 percent of those who know their status are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 90 percent of those on ART achieve viral suppression by 2020.In some countries, PEPFAR and other public health groups have made massive progress toward 90-90-90 targets.In July, PEPFAR announced that Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia are nearly there.Surveys conducted last year showed significant progress in four countries.The data for Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia is from a 2016 PEPFAR survey. In South Africa, 86 percent know their status; 65 percent are on ART and 56 percent on ART are virally suppressed, according to UNAIDS.PEPFAR has funded voluntary male contraception and antiretroviral drugs. Once a person’s viral load is suppressed with ARTs, the person is likely to live a longer, healthier life, and the likelihood of transmitting HIV plummets — it can be as effective as consistent condom use.PEPFAR was established in 2003 by President George W. Bush and was reauthorized in 2008 and again in 2009 under Barack Obama. It’s not entirely clear if funding for PEPFAR will change during the Trump administration. In April, Bush defended the program in an op-ed in the Washington Post: “Saving nearly 12 million lives is proof that PEPFAR works, and I urge our government to fully fund it,” he wrote.Since it’s inception, PEPFAR reports it has prevented nearly 2 million babies from being born with HIV, supported more than 11.5 million people on ARTs and provided HIV testing and counseling to 74.3 million people.It is unclear exactly how the Trump administration will fund PEPFAR. Unlike other agencies, PEPFAR is not specifically targeted for drastic cuts, but the budget submitted to Congress calls for big cuts — $13.5 billion to foreign aid programs like USAID, many of which contribute to PEPFAR’s bottom line — that many think will have devastating effects in Africa.In 2012, officials added a new drug to their toolkit. PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a pill that can be taken daily (studies are underway exploring other methods of taking the drug) and can prevent the HIV virus from replicating in a person’s blood. The WHO identified the drug as a preventative tool in 2012; in 2014 the CDC began recommending its preventative use in high-risk populations.In the United States, PrEP, usually available under the drug named Truvada, is available mostly to gay men. In 2016, drug manufacturer Gilead reported that about 79,000 people had prescriptions. Of those, 60,872 were men and 18,812 were women. Researchers said use picked up in major cities with large gay populations where advocacy groups encouraged men to use the drug. Uptake by women is still low, though.To be sure, in the US PrEP can be quite expensive. For those without insurance, it can be $1,300 a month or more. Even for those with insurance, co-pays and deductibles can still make the drug several hundred dollars a month.In South Africa, only sex workers are given free access to PrEP, but the government plans to expand it to young women. For now, there are a number of trials investigating different methods to administer PrEP. The current method, a once-a-day pill, is sometimes a regimen that cannot be followed, so drug companies are testing an injectable PrEP that lasts 8 weeks.Investigators are also doing trials on a slow-release vaginal ring.It's a silicone ring and it's impregnated with an anti-retroviral, says Dr. Katherine Gill, a medical officer leading the trials at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation in Cape Town.Gill says that the ring, if proven safe, could avert at least a million HIV infections [globally] over the next 20 years.Reporting by Andrea Crossan, Jasmine Garsd and Alex Newman.

The deputy director of health services at Swaziland's ministry of health was presenting the findings from a new survey showing that the country — which has the highest adult HIV prevalence in the world — is on track toward epidemic control.Swaziland has nearly halved the number of new HIV infections among adults since 2011, an achievement largely made possible by rapidly scaling up the number of people accessing antiretroviral therapy, or ART. The latest Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey, or SHIMS 2, funded by the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief showed more than 80 percent of adult HIV patients are now taking the drugs and 73.1 percent are virally suppressed.Research has established that increasing the number of people who are virally suppressed — which means that while the virus remains in the body, it is virtually impossible to detect — is critical to reducing HIV transmission. Virally suppressed patients are unlikely to pass the infection.At 28.8 percent, Swaziland still has the highest adult HIV prevalence in the world. But experts said the recent gains signal the country will reach the point at which new HIV infections fall below the number of deaths of HIV-infected people. Okello spoke to Devex about the significance of the recent findings and how Swaziland achieved them. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.What were the most critical components of how you achieved these results?Swaziland has always had that severe HIV epidemic, and we took time to act on it. We didn't know much about incidence then [the rate of new diagnosis]. But we could just see that prevalence was a problem [how widespread the disease was]. I think we initially acted on the prevalence. We can't have more people living with HIV.When we reached around 2010, we saw the curve of prevalence starting to stabilize. We started feeling we needed incidence measurements now to compare. Bringing down prevalence will take a lot of time, because there's a huge pool of people who are HIV-positive in the country.SHIMS 1 came as an incidence study in 2011, and it helped us also convince our politicians. Our politicians were saying, You're wrong. These are figures that are cooked. You people just want money from donors. We said, No, incidence is still the highest in the world.How did they respond once you had the data to present?We were able to scale up ART, because we asked them to ring fence the money. We were going through financial hurdles, with cash flow problems. But we were able to convince politicians to ring fence the money for drugs. Everything else, all the partners helping us, they are helping us because we committed to buying the drugs. So let's not drop that commitment.Right now we are at around 200,000 people on ART. We're spending way beyond 400 million [South African] rands ($30.65 million), only on drugs. We're not talking about other things around it, like reagents [the mixture added to a sample of a person's blood to conduct a rapid HIV test]. We've requested that donors and partners assist us with the other things, such as reagents, trainings. But the staff is government, fully.More prevention, like condom use, continues to be scaled up. But for me, what has made the major impact is the evidence that if you put as many people as possible on treatment within your population, you will see a reduction in the rate of new infections. I think for us, that is proof. And also it validates the amount of money we are spending. In proportion to the total health budget, this is around a third, only for antiretrovirals. There are still other drugs and salaries [to pay].What are the next steps in your response?The people who are missed [in accessing treatment] will be hiding somewhere because of stigma. These are key populations — men having sex with men, commercial sex workers. We've established a program already that brings these people out, [for example if] it means meeting them at night. It's a sensitive area. In the rest of Africa, men having sex with men [aren't recognized]. Commercial sex workers are there. We're trying to have those sensitive programs to make sure they get tested, they get treatment. They're not marginalized in the health facilities.Is the government also paying for this?Partially the government, but a lot of donors as well. PEPFAR is assisting to scale up. The program for key populations has always been there, but it's only now, with PEPFAR assistance, that we're coming out to say, “who are the other key populations?” The prisoners. The young girls. Identifying those specific groups that we think are hiding or are unable to access services.What lessons can other countries and donors take from your success?I think the most important thing is for the government to be in the driver's seat, but [it should] accept assistance when there are challenges. Also being open to new ideas, to changes. I know we tend to be very rigid sometimes. We [now] tend to keep an open mind, although fine tuning things to fit the local communities.There are a lot of initiatives that partners have assisted us with, such as the linkage to care approach. Initially, when they first talked about this, I thought, “I'm concerned about people on treatment, I need to keep them on treatment. It's taking a lot of effort to do that. Now you want me to go and search for people and hold them by the hand? Don't they know where the clinic is?” We were thinking: “It's going to take too much work, the nurses won't do it.”But now it's engrained. Health workers feel responsible that after testing, if there's a way, they'll find somebody who can accompany the person to the next point. They do emphasize the checking up, the phone calls. There's a follow up. It’s just changing the way we think.Read more international development news online, and subscribe to The Development Newswire to receive the latest from the world’s leading donors and decision-makers — emailed to you free every business day.",https://www.devex.com/news/q-a-how-swaziland-got-on-track-to-contain-the-world-s-highest-hiv-prevalence-90788,

The vaccine is boosted with a protein that raises antibody levels.In an earlier trial, the prototype prevented infection in 66 percent of rhesus lab monkeys, said Barouch.In humans, it has now been shown to be safe and to generate an immune response.Of course, we don't know yet whether this vaccine will protect humans, the researcher said.However, these data to date support the advancement of this vaccine candidate into a larger... efficacy trial, which we hope will start before the end of this calendar year.That will depend on additional data to be gathered in the coming months.IAS president Linda-Gail Bekker described the results as important news.Condoms are still at the frontline of efforts to prevent infection -- mainly through sex and blood contact.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in Maryland, told AFP that developing a vaccine was going to be very difficult but would be really a game changer.If in fact we get a very moderately-effective, a 50-60 percent effective vaccine, that will go a long way when you combine it together with other prevention modalities... to really having a major impact on the pandemic, he said ahead of the conference.Another vaccine candidate, dubbed HVTN 702, is being tested in a major clinical trial in South Africa.",http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Swaziland_halves_worlds_highest_HIV_infection_rate_report_999.html,

There’s prevalence, which tells you the fraction of people who are infected with the virus at any particular time. And there’s incidence, which tells you how many new people get infected in a given year.Swaziland tops the rankings for both.UNAIDS, the United Nations group focused on HIV/AIDS, reports that last year, HIV prevalence among adults 15-49 in Swaziland was 28.8 percent of the population -- more than 1 out of 4. The incidence rate was 2.36 per 100 person-years. These charts, drawn from , back up Beckham’s claim.The has the same rankings, although the actual numbers vary a bit. A survey published in 2012 by the found slightly higher rates -- 31 percent prevalence and 2.4 percent incidence -- but that would certainly leave the ranking unchanged.Kate Grabowski and Ronald Gray at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us that a constellation of factors led to what Gray called an unmitigated disaster in Swaziland. Researchers debate the relative importance of certain drivers, but a lack of HIV treatment and prevention, as well as migration patterns and social structures all likely play a role.In Swaziland, there are very high rates of polygamy, Gray said, plus many men work as miners in South Africa and Botswana where prostitution is common.That could explain the high rate, but as far as Swaziland’s top rank among nations, that might have more to do with its small size.Grabowski noted that in some ways, Swaziland resembles other HIV hot spots.There are other communities that are not necessarily countries which also have high HIV prevalence, Grabowski said. Unfortunately Swaziland gets highlighted because it happens to be one of those places and it is also a country.Beckham said that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV in the world. Official numbers back that up.

The decline was also steeper for men, with 52 percent, than for women (40 percent).The survey showed that 73 percent of HIV-positive people had achieved suppression of the virus — meaning it does not replicate to make them ill — compared to 35 percent in 2011.The gains were the fruit of a much improved HIV-treatment program, said the researchers. The share of infected people on ART rose from 37 percent in 2011 to 74 percent last year.ART not only stops HIV from replicating and attacking a patient's immune system, but also curbs its spread to sexual partners.Our recipe for success is that we... have been able to scale up a lot of the prevention and treatment services in the country, said Okello.We have more than doubled the number of people who have started on anti-retroviral treatment, and we have also almost doubled the number of men who have been circumcised in the country.According to the World Health Organization, there is compelling evidence that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV by as much as 60 percent in men.The number of HIV tests conducted in Swaziland more than doubled from 176,000 in 2011 to 367,000 in 2016.Basically, we think that that's one of the recipes (for success), and also the government commitment to buying and procuring the ARVs for people in the country so that there is a sustainable response going forward, said Okello.Despite the great news, she cautioned much more needs to be done to maintain the downward trend.While we do celebrate these findings, we still know that Swaziland is facing a severe HIV epidemic, she said.In the end, we would like to see a Swaziland which is free from AIDS.WATCH: The Hunt for Patient Zero Is Important But Almost Impossible",https://www.seeker.com/health/medicine/swaziland-has-nearly-halved-the-rate-of-new-hiv-infections,

It's a good moment to look at one eccentric Apollo story: the tale of Aldrin's hushed-up communion on the moon.Before Armstrong and Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module on July 20, 1969, Aldrin unstowed a small plastic container of wine and some bread. He had brought them to the moon from Webster Presbyterian church near Houston, where he was an elder. Aldrin had received permission from the Presbyterian church's general assembly to administer it to himself. In his book Magnificent Desolation he shares the message he then radioed to Nasa: I would like to request a few moments of silence … and to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.He then ate and drank the elements. The surreal ceremony is described in an article by Aldrin in a 1970 copy of Guideposts magazine: I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.He also read a section of the gospel of John. During it all, Armstrong, reportedly a deist, is said to have watched respectfully but without making any comment.The story of the secret communion service only emerged after the mission. Aldrin had originally planned to share the event with the world over the radio. However, at the time Nasa was still reeling from a lawsuit filed by the firebrand atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, resulting in the ceremony never being broadcast. The founder of American Atheists and self-titled most hated woman in America had taken on Nasa, as well as many other public organisation. Most famously, she successfully fought mandatory school prayer and bible recitation in US public schools.After the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit, O'Hair wanted a ban on Nasa astronauts practising religion on earth, in space or around and about the moon while on duty. She believed it violated the constitutional separation between church and state. In Magnificent Desolation, Aldrin explains how astronaut Deke Slayton, who ran the Apollo 11 flight crew operations, told him to tone down his lunar communiqué. Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general, he advised. Looking back Aldrin writes that the communion was his way of thanking God for the success of the mission. Yet, later he hinted that he could have been more inclusive:O'Hair's case against Nasa eventually fizzled out, but it dramatically changed the tone of the Apollo 11 landing. Aldrin had originally intended a much more pioneering Christopher Columbus-style ceremony on the moon. That was never to be.But at Webster Presbyterian church – the spiritual home of many astronauts – Aldrin's communion service is still celebrated every July, known as Lunar Communion Sunday. Pastor Helen DeLeon told me how they replay the tape of Aldrin on the moon and recite Psalm eight, which he had quoted on his return trip to Earth (… what is man that thou art mindful of him). The church still holds the chalice that Aldrin brought back with him. Judy Allton, a geologist and historian of Webster Presbyterian church, produced a paper, presented at a Nasa conference, arguing that communion could be an essential part of future manned space travel. She claims that rituals such as Aldrin's communion reinforce the homelink.And as for O'Hair? History was unkind. She disappeared in 1995 along with her son Jon and granddaughter Robin Murray. After a long hunt, their dismembered and charred bodies were found in a field. Authorities believe that David Waters, a former employee of O'Hair, masterminded a plot to rob and murder O'Hair. Her born-again son, William Murray, who lost not only his mother but also his brother and daughter to Waters and his associates, has spoken very strongly about his upbringing under O'Hair. He mourns his family but believes his mother was pumped up by her own hype and was even evil. In a statement given in 1999 he said, she honestly believed she had singlehandedly removed prayer from school. She honestly believed she had 'liberated' America sexually. Whatever we make of Murray's criticisms, it appears O'Hair was a woman on a mission in the 60s and 70s. Having taken on the world, O'Hair believed it was perfectly plausible to take on space.But in a sense, she need not have worried. No human has visited the moon since 1972, let alone preached from it. Meanwhile, the last message broadcast from another planet was a song by American singer and rapper Will.i.am. It was relayed by Nasa's Curiosity rover currently exploring Mars.

See Example( s )Communion on the Moon: July 20th, 1969 Forty years ago today two human beings changed history by walking on the surface of the moon. But what happened before Buzz Aldrin (pictured in the LM, left) and Neil Armstrong exited the Lunar Module is perhaps even more amazing, if only because so few people know about it. I'm talking about the fact that Buzz Aldrin took communion on the surface of the moon. Some months after his return, he wrote about it in Guideposts magazine. And a few years ago I had the privilege of meeting him myself. I asked him about it and he confirmed the story to me, and I wrote about in my book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God (But Were Afraid to Ask). The background to the story is that Aldrin was an elder at his Presbyterian Church in Texas during this period in his life, and knowing that he would soon be doing something unprecedented in human history, he felt he should mark the occasion somehow, and he asked his pastor to help him. And so the pastor consecrated a communion wafer and a small vial of communion wine. And Buzz Aldrin took them with him out of the Earth's orbit and on to the surface of the moon. He and Armstrong had only been on the lunar surface for a few minutes when Aldrin made the following public statement: This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way. He then ended radio communication and there, on the silent surface of the moon, 250,000 miles from home, he read a verse from the Gospel of John, and he took communion. Here is his own account of what happened: In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, 'I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit. Apart from me you can do nothing.' I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O'Hare [sic], the celebrated opponent of religion, over the crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly. I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility . It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements. And of course, it's interesting to think that some of the first words spoken on the moon were the words of Jesus Christ, who made the Earth and the Who, in the immortal words of Dante, is Himself the Love that moves the Sun and other stars.One of the smaller details lost amidst the tremendous historic and scientific achievements of the mission that landed the first two human beings on the moon in was that it also marked the first occasion on which a Christian took the sacrament of Communion on an astronomical body other than Earth. This event took place in the interval between the lunar module’s landing on the moon on 1969 and Neil Armstrong’s taking his first steps on the lunar surface several hours later; during that period, astronaut Buzz Aldrin privately observed Communion using elements he had brought with him to the moon.Aldrin openly described his Communion experience on the moon in print several times, including an interview with LIFE magazine, an October 1970 Guideposts article, and his 1973 book Return to Earth. The following account of his motivations and preparation is taken from Aldrin’s 2009 book, Magnificent Desolation:Landing on the moon is not quite the same thing as arriving at Grandmother’s for Thanksgiving. You don’t hop out of the lunar module the moment the engine stops and yell, “We’re here! We’re here!” Getting out of the LM takes a lot of preparation, so we had built in several extra hours to our flight plan. We also figured it was wise to allow more time rather than less for our initial activities after landing, just in case anything had gone wrong during the flight. According to our schedule, we were supposed to eat a meal, rest awhile, and then sleep for seven hours after arriving on the moon. After all, we had already worked a long, full day and we wanted to be fresh for our extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Mission Control had notified the media that they could take a break and catch their breath since there wouldn’t be much happening for several hours as we rested. But it was hard to rest with all that adrenaline pumping through our systems. Nevertheless, in an effort to remain calm and collected, I decided that this would be an excellent time for a ceremony I had planned as an expression of gratitude and hope. Weeks before, as the Apollo mission drew near, I had originally asked Dean Woodruff, pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, where my family and I attended services when I was home in Houston, to help me come up with something I could do on the moon, some appropriate symbolic act regarding the universality of seeking. I had thought in terms of doing something overtly patriotic, but everything we came up with sounded trite and jingoistic. I settled on a well-known expression of spirituality: celebrating the first Christian Communion on the moon, much as Christopher Columbus and other explorers had done when they first landed in their “new world.” I wanted to do something positive for the world, so the spiritual aspect appealed greatly to me, but NASA was still smarting from a lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair after the astronauts read from the biblical creation account in Genesis. O’Hair contended this was a violation of the constitutional separation of church and state. Although O’Hair’s views did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without. I met with Deke Slayton, one of the original “Mercury Seven” astronauts who ran our flight-crew operations, to inform him of my plans and that I intended to tell the world what I was doing. Deke said, “No, that’s not a good idea, Buzz. Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general.” I understood that Deke didn’t want any more trouble. So, during those first hours on the moon, before the planned eating and rest periods, I reached into my personal preference kit and pulled out the communion elements along with a three-by-five card on which I had written the words of Jesus: “I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.” I poured a thimbleful of wine from a sealed plastic container into a small chalice, and waited for the wine to settle down as it swirled in the one-sixth Earth gravity of the moon. My comments to the world were inclusive: “I would like to request a few moments of and to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.” I silently read the Bible passage as I partook of the wafer and the wine, and offered a private prayer for the task at hand and the opportunity I had been given. Neil watched respectfully, but made no comment to me at the time. Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the experience that by giving thanks to God. It was my hope that people would keep the whole event in their minds and see, beyond minor details and technical achievements, a deeper challenge, and the human need to explore whatever is above us, below us, or out there.Some sources asserted that Aldrin’s taking of Communion was kept “secret” from the public by NASA due to an ongoing lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray :However, it’s not completely true that the public was kept in the dark about the event until many years later. Although Aldrin maintained that NASA asked him not to broadcast his observance of Communion, news accounts released while the mission was in progress reported that Aldrin was bringing Communion bread with him to the moon and would be joining Earth-bound parishioners in observing Communion from the lunar surface, as noted in this 1969 Associated Press dispatch:Buzz Aldrin’s observance of Communion was dramatized in an episode of the 1998 HBO mini-series From the Earth to the Moon:The handwritten card containing the Bible verse that Aldrin recited during his lunar Communion service was offered at auction in 2007.",https://www.snopes.com/glurge/communion.asp,

Aldrin said, We wanted to express our feeling that what man was doing in this mission transcended electronics and computers and rockets.The communion bread and wine, symbols of everyday life, seemed to be a fitting way to commemorate the extraordinary moment. Woodruff equipped Aldrin with a piece of communion bread, a sip of wine, and a tiny silver chalice which he brought aboard as part of the few personal items each astronaut is allowed.Aldrin wrote about the experience a year later, for Guideposts magazine:In a little while after our scheduled meal period, Neil would give the signal to step down the ladder onto the powdery surface of the moon. Now was the moment for communion. So I unstowed the elements in their flight packets. I put them and the scripture reading on the little table in front of the abort guidance system computer. “Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking.

It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.Before taking communion, Aldrin silently read a passage from the Bible, which he had hand written on a piece of paper: “I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me” (John 15:5).

She sued them over the public reading of Genesis by the crew of Apollo 8, citing the status of astronauts as government employees and the separation of church and state to support her case.Looking back on that moment, Aldrin reflected in his memoir that perhaps he should have chosen a more universal way of commemorating the achievement, a first for all humankind.“Perhaps if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion,” he wrote. “Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind—be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists.

What most people do not know is the date also marks when Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin celebrated the first and only Lord’s Supper on the moon, a fact the U.S. government refused to make public at the time.Inside the lunar module, just hours before stepping onto the moon for the first time, Aldrin radioed Houston Space Center Mission Control. He asked for a few moments of silence “to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.”In that moment of silence that followed, Aldrin silently read a passage from the book of John that he had written out on a 3×5 card: “I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.” Then he took out the miniature chalice and bread and wine from his personal allowance pouch. “I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me,” he told Guideposts magazine in 1970. “In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.” Neil Armstrong, the other astronaut onboard, did not participate.But that was not Aldrin’s original plan—he had wanted to celebrate communion on the air with the rest of his comments, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was not happy about it. Just months earlier, the Apollo 8 astronauts broadcast parts of the Biblical creation narrative from the book of Genesis while orbiting the moon on Christmas Eve: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” Atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair sued, arguing that the astronauts were government employees and therefore their actions violated the separation of church and state. The Supreme Court dismissed the case—for lack of jurisdiction—but it created enough of a stir that NASA wanted to avoid any such distractions from their missions. When Aldrin, a devout Presbyterian, told NASA flight operations coordinator Deke Slayton of his plan to celebrate communion during the live broadcast, Slayton told him to stand down. “No, that’s not a good idea, Buzz,” Slayton told him, according to Adrin’s memoir Magnificent Desolation. “Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general.”Aldrin later questioned his own decision to celebrate the Christian practice. “Perhaps if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion,” he wrote in his memoir. “Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind—be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God.”Webster Presbyterian Church—Aldrin’s church in Houston that supplied him with the bread and the wine for the unique occasion—still celebrates the lunar communion every year on the Sunday closest to July 20.",http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/20/the-secret-communion-on-the-moon-the-44-year-anniversary/,

But what happened before Buzz Aldrin (pictured in the LM, left) and Neil Armstrong exited the Lunar Module is perhaps even more amazing, if only because so few people know about it.I’m talking about the fact that Buzz Aldrin took communion on the surface of the moon. Some months after his return, he wrote about it in Guideposts magazine. And a few years ago I had the privilege of meeting him myself. (See photo below.) I asked him about it and he confirmed the story to me, and I wrote about in my book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God (But Were Afraid to Ask).The background to the story is that Aldrin was an elder at his Presbyterian Church in Texas during this period in his life, and knowing that he would soon be doing something unprecedented in human history, he felt he should mark the occasion somehow, and he asked his pastor to help him. And so the pastor consecrated a communion wafer and a small vial of communion wine. And Buzz Aldrin took them with him out of the Earth’s orbit and on to the surface of the moon.He and Armstrong had only been on the lunar surface for a few minutes when Aldrin made the following public statement: “This is the LM pilot. I’d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.” He then ended radio communication and there, on the silent surface of the moon, 250,000 miles from home, he read a verse from the Gospel of John, and he took communion. Here is his own account of what happened:“In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit. Apart from me you can do nothing.’ I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare, the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly. …I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements.”And of course, it’s interesting to think that some of the first words spoken on the moon were the words of Jesus Christ, who made the Earth and the moon — and Who, in the immortal words of Dante, is Himself the “Love that moves the Sun and other stars.”Eric Metaxas is the host of Socrates in the City in Manhattan, and is the best-selling author of Amazing Grace:  William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery.  For more information visit www.ericmetaxas.com. © Eric Metaxas.

The First Communion on the Moon is now one of The Episcopal Church's lesser feasts and fasts,he writes. On Sunday July 20, 1969 the first people landed on the moon.

Psalm 91:4Message claims that Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin took communion on the Moon using a special communion kit given to him by his church ().Mostly True(Submitted, October 2009O)This email claims that Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the Moon, performed the ritual of communion in the lunar lander soon after touchdown on July 20, 1969. The message explains how Aldrin opened the small plastic packages containing the communion bread and wine, poured the wine into a chalice supplied by his church and then ate and drank these communion elements while giving thanks for the success and safety of their epic journey. The message also notes that Aldrin had intended to broadcast his communion words back to the people on Earth, but NASA asked him to refrain from this because of ongoing legal issues regarding the reading of scripture during a previous Apollo voyage.The information in the message is mostly true. A July 21 2009 article on the CBN news website notes:Another July 2009 article in the Washington Post confirms the information in the message:While the core information in the message is factual, the claim that NASA deliberately kept Aldrin's communion a secret for two decades appears to be unfounded. Aldrin himself wrote of the communion in a Guideposts Magazine from October 1970, a little over a year after the Moon landing. And as noted in the CBN news quote above, Webster Presbyterian Church of Houston, Texas has openly commemorated Aldrin's moon communion every year since the landing. While it is well documented that NASA opted not to broadcast Aldrin's communion message because of possible legal ramifications, there is no evidence to suggest that it subsequently tried to hide the event for over twenty years. At least, if it was NASA's intention to suppress the information, it was singularly unsuccessful. In fact, Aldrin's communion is even mentioned in NASA's own history of the Apollo missions.The communion was dramatized in an episode of From the Earth to the Moon , a twelve-part HBO television miniseries from 1998.Last updated: 28th October 2009 First published: 28th October 2009 Write-up by Brett M.

Aldrin has said that he planned to broadcast the service, but NASA at the last minute asked him not to because of concerns about a lawsuit filed (later dismissed) by atheist Madelyn Murray O’Hare after Apollo 8 astronauts read from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas.Did NASA do the right thing by making Aldrin keep his religious beliefs to himself?As an elder in the Presbyterian church, Aldrin had the authority to conduct what is called an “extended serving” of the Lord’s Supper. But Aldrin was representing the United States of America that day, and in many ways, all of his fellow earthlings. Should he have even conducted a private religious service?“In the radio blackout,” Aldrin wrote in Guideposts magazine in 1970, “I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit.’“I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements.”One small sip for man, one giant leap of faith for mankind.The small chalice Aldrin used for the wine went back to Webster Church. Each year on the Sunday closest to July 20, the congregation celebrates Lunar Communion. “Communion can be celebrated anywhere,” senior pastor Mark Cooper said Sunday. “Even cramped up in a lunar module on the moon.”Aldrin wasn’t the only person to bring his faith to the moon that day. The astronauts left behind a tiny silicon chip containing a message of peace from four U.S. presidents and 73 other world leaders. Seven of them made references to God — the presidents of Brazil, Ireland, South Vietnam and Malagasy, the king of Belgium, Pope Paul VI — and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, who wrote:“On this occasion when Mr. Neil Armstrong and Colonel Edwin Aldrin set foot for the first time on the surface of the Moon from the Earth, we pray the Almighty God to guide mankind towards ever increasing success in the establishment of peace and the progress of culture, knowledge and human civilisation.”UPDATE: I asked On Faith panelist Richard Mouw about provisions for self-serve communion. Mouw is president of Fuller Theological Seminary. He also is representing the Presbyterian Church-USA as co-chair of the official Reformed-Catholic Dialogue. Mouw’s response:“For our Reformed theology, communion is something that necessarily takes place in a congregational context, with two requirements. It is tied to–accompanied by– the preaching of the Word and it requires at least one elder assisting the minister. Two exceptions: chaplains in military and other settings are given a blanket approval to conduct a communion rite without an elder. And a minister and elder may bring the elements to a sick or shut-in person–with the understanding that this is an extension of the congregational rite that has recently taken place. There is simply no provision for a solitary self-serving of communion. It is difficult to think of a theological rationale even as an unusual event.”",https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/2009/07/20/first-communion-on-the-moon/8125,

It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.",Classics: Buzz Aldrin on Communion in Space,"For several weeks prior to the scheduled lift-off of Apollo 11 back in July, 1969, the pastor of our church, Dean Woodruff, and I had been struggling to find the right symbol for the first lunar landing.We wanted to express our feeling that what man was doing in this mission transcended electronics and computers and rockets.Dean often speaks at our church, Webster Presbyterian, just outside of Houston, about the many meanings of the communion service.One of the principal symbols, Dean says, is that God reveals Himself in the common elements of everyday life. Traditionally, these elements are bread and wine–common foods in Bible days and typical products of man’s labor.One day while I was at Cape Kennedy working with the sophisticated tools of the space effort, it occurred to me that these tools were the typical elements of life today.I wondered if it might be possible to take communion on the moon, symbolizing the thought that God was revealing Himself there too, as man reached out into the universe. For there are many of us in the NASA program who do trust that what we are doing is part of God’s eternal plan for man.I spoke with Dean about the idea as soon as I returned home, and he was enthusiastic.I could carry the bread in a plastic packet, the way regular inflight food is wrapped. And the wine also–there will be just enough gravity on the moon for liquid to pour. I’ll be able to drink normally from a cup.Dean, I wonder if you could look around for a little chalice that I could take with me as coming from the church?The next week Dean showed me a graceful silver cup. I hefted it and was pleased to find that it was light enough to take along. Each astronaut is allowed a few personal items on a flight; the wine chalice would be in my personal-preference kit.Dean made plans for two special communion services at Webster Presbyterian Church. One would be held just prior to my leaving Houston for Cape Kennedy, when I would join the other members in a dedication service.The second would take place two weeks later, Sunday, July 20, when Neil Armstrong and I were scheduled to be on the surface of the moon.On that Sunday the church back home would gather for communion, while I joined them as close as possible to the same hour, taking communion inside the lunar module, all of us meaning to represent in this small way not only our local church but the Church as a whole.Right away questions came up. Was it theologically correct for a layman to serve himself communion under these circumstances? Dean thought so, but to make sure he decided to write the stated clerk of the Presbyterian church’s General Assembly and got back a quick reply that this was permissible.And how much should we talk about our plans? I am naturally rather reticent, but on the other hand I was becoming increasingly convinced that having religious convictions carried with it the responsibility of witnessing to them.Finally we decided we would say nothing about the communion service until after the moonshot.I had a question about which scriptural passage to use. Which reading would best capture what this enterprise meant to us? I thought long about this and came up at last with John 15:5. It seemed to fit perfectly.I wrote the passage on a slip of paper to be carried aboard Eagle along with the communion elements. Dean would read the same passage at the full congregation service held back home that same day.So at last we were set. And then trouble appeared. It was Saturday, just prior to the first of the two communion services. The next day Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins and I were to depart Houston for Cape Kennedy.We were scheduled for a pre-mission press conference when the flight physician arrived and set up elaborate precautions against crew contamination. We had to wear sterile masks and to talk to the reporters from within a special partition.The doctor was taking no chances. A cold germ, a flu virus, and the whole shot might have to be aborted. I felt I had to tell him about the big church service scheduled for the next morning. When I did, he wasn’t at all happy.I called Dean with the news late Saturday night. It doesn’t look real good, Dean.What about a private service? Without the whole congregation?It was a possibility. I called the doctor about the smaller service, and he agreed, provided there were only a handful of people present.So the next day, Sunday, shortly after the end of the 11 o’clock service my wife, Joan, and our oldest boy, Mike (the only one of our three children who is as yet a communicant), went to the church. There we met Dean, his wife, Floy, and our close family friend Tom Manison, elder of the church, and his wife.The seven of us went into the now-empty sanctuary. On the communion table were two loaves of bread, one for now, the other for two weeks from now. Beside the two loaves were two chalices, one of them the small cup the church was giving me for the service on the moon.We took communion. At the end of the service Dean tore off a corner of the second loaf of bread and handed it to me along with the tiny chalice. Within a few hours I was on my way to Cape Kennedy.What happened there, of course, the whole world knows. The Saturn 5 rocket gave us a rough ride at first, but the rest of the trip was smooth. On the day of the moon landing, we awoke at 5:30 a.m., Houston time.Neil and I separated from Mike Collins in the command module. Our powered descent was right on schedule, and perfect except for one unforeseeable difficulty. The automatic guidance system would have taken Eagle to an area with huge boulders. Neil had to steer Eagle to a more suitable terrain.With only seconds worth of fuel left, we touched down at 3:30 p.m.Now Neil and I were sitting inside Eagle, while Mike circled in lunar orbit, unseen in the black sky above us. In a little while after our scheduled meal period, Neil would give the signal to step down the ladder onto the powdery surface of the moon. Now was the moment for communion.So I unstowed the elements in their flight packets. I put them and the scripture reading on the little table in front of the abort guidance-system computer.Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking. I would, like to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his own individual way.For me this meant taking communion. In the radio blackout I opened the little plastic packages which contained bread and wine.I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.And so, just before I partook of the elements, I read the words which I had chosen to indicate our trust that as man probes into space we are in fact acting in Christ.I sensed especially strongly my unity with our church back home, and with the Church everywhere.I read: I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.

Now was the moment for communion. So I unstowed the elements in their flight packets. I put them and the scripture reading on the little table in front of the abort guidance system computer. “Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking.

I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.Theologically, there has been great debate about what Buzz did in space. Some Christians believe that communion is something that only priests can perform, while others believe that it is very important for the act to be done in the presence of others – much like when Jesus broke bread with the disciples in the Gospels.What makes the argument interesting is that Buzz Aldrin happened to be a Presbyterian Elder at Webster Presbyterian Church in Webster, Texas. Therefore, he was allowed (as per Presbyterian policy) to perform the communion. Additionally, since he was technically the only person in the Lunar Module, he could have been considered a “Shut In”, which is the only given example of when it is theologically applicable to perform communion by ones’ self.Regardless of your religious leanings, what Buzz did is an interesting achievement:  bringing religion to space. But it begs some further questions on Christianity in space: Who actually leads Christianity in the heavens?Muslims only answered the question in 2014 by issuing a fatwa concerning prayer towards Mecca. But for Catholics, the answer was already known before any man or even animal entered space. In fact, the Catholic Church already had discussed which Bishop would preside over the moon in the early 1900’s.Currently, the Bishop of Orlando is the reigning “Moon Priest”, or space pope if you will. The decree was established many years prior defining that any vessel traveling from a port of call would be under the authority of the Bishop of the said port of call. In the case of NASA and Cape Canaveral, it would be the aforementioned Bishop of Orlando. One wonders, though, how that will change and evolve as more and more people go into space, and one day, live there as well. Will Christianity or religion survive in space? Its impossible to know, but for Mr. Aldrin, the very foundations of lunar exploration by humanity were rooted in appreciation towards God and religion.",http://knowledgeglue.com/buzz-aldrin-and-the-first-meal-on-the-moon/,

In this new world now inhabited by Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, everything was a first. Neil had his first step, the first photographs were snapped and, eventually, the pair sat down for their first meal. What does one eat to celebrate something as momentous as landing on the Moon?Bacon, apparently. This may not have been a deliberate celebratory decision (although there's still debate about which bits of Moon landing lore were pre-planned and which were not). But there was bacon nonetheless, says Amy Shira Teitel for her blog Vintage Space.[B]acon cubes were among the meals stored in the lunar module. And it worked out that meal A, the first scheduled meal to be eaten on the Moon, consisted of bacon squares, peaches, sugar cookie cubes, pineapple grapefruit drink and coffee. They ate history’s first meal on Moon slightly ahead of schedule after landing at the Sea of Tranquility.According to Teitel, bacon has a long history in the American space program, showing up in meals as far back as the early Gemini missions. And from the beginning, it was a popular menu item. So it's easy to imagine that Armstrong and Aldrin enjoyed the dried, salted treat in their first Moon meal.But in recent years, Teitel says, things have changed at NASA. Though many improvements have been made to spacefarers' food options, there is now one thing that is distinctly missing. Yep, bacon.[B]acon squares lived on after Apollo. In the 1990s, NASA astronauts also had bacon squares as part of their meal options. A meal plan from 2002, however, had a distinct lack of bacon.

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in the lunar lander which touched down at 3:17 Eastern Standard Time.Buzz Aldrin had with him the Reserved Sacrament. He radioed: “Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM pilot speaking. I would like to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each person listening in, whoever or wherever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the last few hours, and to give thanks in his own individual way.”Later he wrote: “In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit.’ I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute Deke Slayton had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare, the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly…Eagle’s metal body creaked. I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements.”NASA kept this secret for two decades. The memoirs of Buzz Aldrin and the Tom Hanks’s Emmy- winning HBO mini-series, From the Earth to the Moon (1998), made people aware of this act of Christian worship 235,000 miles from Earth.The 2003 Episcopal Church General Convention resolved that the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music prepare propers and collects for churchwide observance of the 40th anniversary of the event, July 20, 2009, and to include “The First Communion on the Moon” in The Episcopal Church’s Lesser Feasts and Fasts and on the calendar in the Book of Common Prayer for July 20. (Biretta tip: @rrchapman)I only have the 1991 Lesser Feasts and Fasts on my shelf so cannot quote more than what I have found online. If you have the revised version, please add any omitted material in the comments section. I understand that there is now a “Common” to commemorate “those who have died in the course of space exploration – among them a significant number of Episcopalians. In addition, it provides a way of praying for future space explorers and for the thousands of people whose work make the space program possible.” The collect for this “Common” reads:Creator of the universe, your dominion extends through the immensity of space: guide and guard those who seek to fathom its mysteries [especially N.N.]. Save us from arrogance lest we forget that our achievements are grounded in you, and, by the grace of your Holy Spirit, protect our travels beyond the reaches of earth, that we may glory ever more in the wonder of your creation: through Jesus Christ, your Word, by whom all things came to be, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.Colonel Aldrin holds a doctorate in astro-physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was acknowledged as the most highly educated of the first astronauts. He is a wonderful example of a scientist who is a committed Christian.There appear differing versions of the story whether Buzz Aldrin was a Presbyterian or an Episcopalian/Anglican. I hope this will finally be settled in the comments and then I can amend this post – please add a reference to your comment of the denomination to which Buzz Aldrin belonged at the time of the lunar landing.

The second man on the moon was Colonel Buzz Aldrin.Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent a total of 21 hours and 37 minutes on the moon’s surface before redocking their lunar module Eagle with the command ship Columbia.Buzz Aldrin, who had a Ph.D. from M.I.T., actually helped develop the technology necessary for the mission, especially the complicated lunar-module rendezvous with the command module.Buzz Aldrin shared a little-known story, which was printed in Guideposts Magazine’s article “An Astronaut Tells of a little-known but Significant Event on the Moon” (October 1970), and in his book, “Return to Earth” (Random House, 1973).Before the two astronauts stepped out onto the moon’s surface, there was a planned time of rest. Buzz Aldrin asked for radio silence because NASA was fighting a lawsuit from atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair, who objected to the Apollo 8 crew having read a chapter of the book of Genesis.Buzz Aldrin then privately partook of communion, stating: “For several weeks prior to the scheduled lift-off of Apollo 11 back in July, 1969, the pastor of our church, Dean Woodruff, and I had been struggling to find the right symbol for the first lunar landing. We wanted to express our feeling that what man was doing in this mission transcended electronics and computers and rockets. Dean often speaks at our church, Webster Presbyterian, just outside of Houston, about the many meanings of the communion service. ‘One of the principal symbols,’ Dean says, ‘is that God reveals Himself in the common elements of everyday life.’ Traditionally, these elements are bread and wine – common foods in Bible days and typical products of man’s labor.“One day while I was at Cape Kennedy working with the sophisticated tools of the space effort, it occurred to me that these tools were the typical elements of life today. I wondered if it might be possible to take communion on the moon, symbolizing the thought that God was revealing Himself there too, as man reached out into the universe. For there are many of us in the NASA program who do trust that what we are doing is part of God’s eternal plan for man.”Buzz Aldrin continued: “I spoke with Dean about the idea as soon as I returned home, and he was enthusiastic. ‘I could carry the bread in a plastic packet, the way regular inflight food is wrapped. And the wine also – there will be just enough gravity on the moon for liquid to pour. I’ll be able to drink normally from a cup. Dean, I wonder if you could look around for a little chalice that I could take with me as coming from the church?’“The next week Dean showed me a graceful silver cup. I hefted it and was pleased to find that it was light enough to take along. Each astronaut is allowed a few personal items on a flight; the wine chalice would be in my personal-preference kit.“Dean made special plans for two special communion services at Webster Presbyterian Church. One would be held just prior to my leaving Houston for Cape Kennedy, when I would join the other members in a dedication service. The second would take place two weeks later, Sunday, July 20, when Neil Armstrong and I were scheduled to be on the surface of the moon. On that Sunday the church back home would gather for communion, while I joined them as close as possible to the same hour, taking communion inside the lunar module, all of us meaning to represent in this small way not only our local church but the Church as a whole.”Buzz Aldrin went on: “Right away question came up. Was it theologically correct for a layman to serve himself communion under these circumstances? Dean thought so, but to make sure he decided to write the stated clerk of the Presbyterian church’s General Assembly and got back a quick reply that this was permissible.“And how much should we talk about our plans? I am naturally rather reticent, but on the other hand I was becoming increasingly convinced that having religious convictions carried with it the responsibility of witnessing to them. Finally we decided we would say nothing about the communion service until after the moonshot.“I had a question about which scriptural passage to use. Which reading would best capture what this enterprise meant to us? I thought long about this and came up at last with John 15:5. It seemed to fit perfectly. I wrote the passage on a slip of paper to be carried aboard Eagle along with the communion elements. Dean would read the same passage at the full congregation service held back home that same day.”Discover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore!Buzz Aldrin continued: “So at last we were set. And then trouble appeared. It was Saturday, just prior to the first of the two communion services. The next day, Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins and I were to depart Houston for Cape Kennedy. We were scheduled for a pre-mission press conference when the flight physician arrived and set up elaborate precautions against crew contamination. We had to wear sterile masks and to talk to the reporters from within a special partition. The doctor was taking no chances. A cold germ, a flu virus, and the whole shot might have to be aborted. I felt I had to tell him about the big church service scheduled for the next morning. When I did, he wasn’t at all happy.“I called Dean with the news late Saturday night. ‘It doesn’t look real good, Dean.’ ‘What about a private service? Without the whole congregation?’ It was a possibility. I called the doctor about the smaller service and he agreed, provided there were only a handful of people present.”Buzz Aldrin added: “So the next day, Sunday, shortly after the end of the 11 o’clock service my wife, Joan and our oldest boy Mike (the only one of our three children who is as yet a communicant), went to the church. There we met Dean, his wife, Floy, and our close family friend Tom Manison, elder of the church and his wife. The seven of us went in to the now-empty sanctuary. On the communion table were two loaves of bread, one for now, the other for two weeks from now. Beside the two loaves were two chalices, one of them the small cup the church was giving me for the service on the moon.“We took communion. At the end of the service Dean tore off a corner of the second loaf of bread and handed it to me along with the tiny chalice. Within a few hours I was on my way to Cape Kennedy. What happened there, of course, the whole world knows. The Saturn 5 rocket gave us a rough ride at first, but the rest of the trip was smooth. On the day of the moon landing, we awoke at 5:30 a.m., Houston time. Neil and I separated from Mike Collins in the command module. Our powered descent was right on schedule, and perfect except for one unforeseeable difficulty. The automatic guidance system would have taken Eagle to an area with huge boulders.“Neil had to steer Eagle to a more suitable terrain. With only seconds worth of fuel left, we touched down at 3:30 p.m. Now Neil and I were sitting inside Eagle, while Mike circled in lunar orbit unseen in the black sky above us. In a little while after our scheduled meal period, Neil would give the signal to step down the ladder onto the powdery surface of the moon. Now was the moment for communion.“So I unstowed the elements in their flight packets. I put them and the scripture reading on the little table in front of the abort guidance system computer.“Then I called back to Houston. ‘Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking. I would like to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the past few hours and to invite each person listening, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his own individual way.’“On World Communion Sunday, October 4, 1970, many Christians through the world will unite in spirit as they – each in his own church, according to his own tradition – participate in celebrating the Lord’s Supper. For me this meant taking communion. In the radio blackout I opened the little plastic packages which contained bread and wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup.“It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements. And so, just before I partook of the elements, I read the words, which I had chosen to indicate our trust that as man probes into space we are in fact acting in Christ. I sensed especially strongly my unity with our church back home, and with the Church everywhere.“I read: ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.'”Webster Presbyterian Church on NASA Parkway near Houston, Texas, keeps the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.Buzz Aldrin’s popularity was the inspiration for the character “Buzz Lightyear” in Pixar’s animated movie Toy Story (1995).As they were returning to Earth, July 23, 1969, Buzz Aldrin stated via television: “This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon. … Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. ‘When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?'”Neil Armstrong added: “To all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.”At Mission Control in Houston, Charles Duke had been NASA’s CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator) during the Apollo 11 moon landing. Growing nervous as the lunar module almost ran out of fuel avoiding rocky terrain on its descent, Charles Duke stated upon their successful landing: “Roger, Twank … Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We’re breathing again. Thanks a lot!”Charles Duke later flew to the moon on the Apollo 16 mission. On April 21, 1972, Astronauts Charles Duke and John Young explored the moon’s rugged Descartes region.Years later, Charles Duke spoke at a prayer rally during the Texas State’s Republican Convention in San Antonio’s Lila Cockrell Theatre, June 22, 1996. His remarks were printed in the book, “Charles Duke: Moonwalker” (Rose Petal Press, 2nd edition, 2011, p. 256-261): “I have been before kings and prime ministers, junta leaders and dictators, businessmen and beggars, rich and poor, black and white. … One of the most touching times was in the office of one of the cabinet ministers in Israel. … After the introduction I was asked to share my walk on the moon with the Israeli minister.“‘Mr. Minister,’ I began, ‘I was able to look back at the earth from the moon and hold up my hand and underneath this hand was the earth. The thought occurred to me that underneath my hand were four billion people. I couldn’t see Europe, America, the Middle East. I couldn’t see blacks or whites, Jews or Orientals, just spaceship earth. I realized we needed to learn to love one another, and I believed that with that love and our technical expertise, we could solve all of mankind’s problems. …’“The promises of the Bible are true and, I believe, speak the truth in every area – whether it be in spiritual matters, nutrition, history, or even science. In 1972 aboard Apollo 16, I saw with my own eyes what is written in the Scriptures. In Isaiah 40:22 it says ‘It is He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth.’ And in Job 26:7, it is written ‘He hangeth the earth upon nothing.’“Who told Isaiah that the earth was a circle? … And how did the writer of Job know that the earth hung upon nothing? … This is the Lord I love and serve. This is the Lord who transformed by life. This is the Lord who transformed my marriage. I used to say I could live ten thousand years and never have an experience as thrilling as walking on the moon. But the excitement and satisfaction of that walk doesn’t begin to compare with my walk with Jesus, a walk that lasts forever. I thought Apollo 16 would be my crowning glory, but the crown that Jesus gives will not tarnish or fade away. His crown will last throughout all eternity. …”Charles Duke continued: “Not everyone has the opportunity to walk on the moon, but everybody has the opportunity to walk with the Son. It costs billions of dollars to send someone to the moon, but walking with Jesus is free, the Gift of God. ‘For by Grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.’“You don’t need to go to the moon to find God. I didn’t find God in space – I found him in the front seat of my car on Highway 46 in New Braunfels, Texas, when I opened my heart to Jesus. And my life hasn’t been the same since. Now I can truly look up at the moon and the stars and with the prophets of old exclaim, ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.'”Brought to you by AmericanMinute.com.Discover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore!",http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/1st-food-and-drink-on-moon-holy-communion/,

What more could a fact-checker ask for?So let’s go back a bit, to 1969 and man’s first landing on the moon, a feat that seemed almost magical to anyone watching and listening.Not many people know it but on July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin took communion on the moon. The very first meal ever taken on the moon was the blood and body of Christ! the Facebook post read.We had heard about astronauts partaking of food and dehydrated drinks.And we knew about the Apollo 8 crew on Christmas Eve 1968 reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon, an event heard by millions. But the Holy Communion claim was new to us. We decided to do some exploring of our own.The Facebook post about Aldrin led to a on the JesusLovesYou.org website, a member of the of websites. The sites promote numerous nonprofit organizations for contributions.That post references Aldrin’s comments on the experience: I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this, Aldrin said. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare (sic), the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon Christmas (Eve in 1968). I agreed reluctantly.So, is that why we hadn’t heard about the moon service? Did NASA, under pressure from an atheist activist, try to keep the Christian observance a secret?Our research on this claim led to several sources about the holy meal, but we wanted to hear directly from Aldrin himself. Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 space mission that put the first people on the moon on July 20, 1969. He was the second person to walk on the moon, following fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong.The moonwalker is currently on a tour promoting his newest book, Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration . We tracked down his tour publicist at National Geographic Books, but unfortunately,we were unable to schedule an interview by press time. Aldrin is now consulting for the U.S. government about the future of the country's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday peopleThe Communion event was re-enacted during Episode Six of the HBO-television miniseries  From the Earth to the Moon . The one-season, 12-episode miniseries ran in 1998. It was a dramatized portrayal of the Apollo manned space program’s expeditions to the moon.But in a article after the 1969  mission, Aldrin confirmed that the religious meal took place inside the Eagle spacecraft once it landed on the moon. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me.  In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup, Aldrin said. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements. He then recited a Bible verse, John 15:5.In his , Aldrin notes that Armstrong did not participate in the Communion service. Aldrin also expressed second thoughts about his religious observance.Neil watched respectfully but made no comment to me at the time, Aldrin wrote. Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind -- be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists.Aldrin initially wanted his Communion service broadcast on the air with the rest of his comments and biblical reading. But NASA decided against that idea. It was conducted during radio silence, which means that only he and Armstrong witnessed it. There was no communication between the spacecraft and Mission Control in Houston during radio silence.Atheist activist Madalyn Murray O’Hair had already sued NASA over the 1968 Bible reading in space. O’Hair said the reading violated the legal separation of church and state.Although O’Hair’s ideas did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without, Aldrin wrote. (The was eventually rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.)So during radio silence, Aldrin his Bible verse and took his Communion.Aldrin kept his on-air comments more general. He asked for a few moments of silence to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.To sum up, a Facebook post claimed that NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin took Communion on the moon.  Several sources, including NASA records and Aldrin’s memoirs, include accounts of the Communion service.PolitiFact also discovered that Aldrin’s church, outside of Houston, the lunar Communion service each year on the Sunday closest to the July 20, 1969, moon landing.",http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/sep/16/facebook-posts/facebook-post-recognizes-little-known-space-fact/,

It is, however, unusual to hear about a Christian taking communion nearly 240,000 miles away.July 20 marked the 45th anniversary of the first lunar landing in human history when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon. Armstrong is remembered by his famous that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.Aldrin is not so much recognized for one publicized action, but rather one that the U.S. government and NASA tried to cover up because of a previous lawsuit related to the Apollo 8 reading of Genesis.Before Aldrin and Armstrong took to the moon surface, Buzz decided to take communion; an event that he had wanted to do months before the launch.Excerpt from a Guidepost interview from October 1970 courtesy of Eric Metaxas:One day while I was at Cape Kennedy working with the sophisticated tools of the space effort, it occurred to me that these tools were the typical elements of life today.  I wondered if it might be possible to take communion on the moon, symbolizing the thought that God was revealing Himself there too, as man reached out into the universe.  For there are many of us in the NASA program who do trust that what we are doing is part of God's eternal plan for man.

He said 'stop right there' and I turned. You can see the motion of the strap #Apollo11The three-person Apollo 11 crew landed on the moon on July 20, 1969.Author and radio host Eric Metaxas retweeted an article from his personal blog this week noting that during this time in Aldrin's life he was an elder at his Presbyterian Church in Texas, and knew that he would be doing something unprecedented in human history, and that he felt he should mark the occasion somehow, and solicited help from his pastor.His pastor consecrated a communion wafer and a small vial of communion wine. And Aldrin took them with him to the moon.After he and Armstrong had been on the lunar surface a few minutes, Aldrin said the following to the public, who were watching 250,000 miles away:I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup, he recounted.Then he read John 15:5: I am the vine, you are the branches.

NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O'Hare, the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas, Aldrin said.As he thanked God, he noted that it was interesting for him to realize that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/astronaut-buzz-aldrin-took-communion-read-gospel-of-john-moon-48-years-ago-192848/,

'I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup,' Aldrin described in a 1970 copy of Guideposts magazine, cited in the'It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.'Before that, Aldrin had radioed Houston Space Center Mission Control inviting listeners to 'give thanks' with him and also read a section of the gospel of John he had written on a card: 'I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.'That card was auctioned in Texas in 2007, according toThe surreal story of Aldrian's secret communion service only emerged after the mission.While the devout Presbyterian wanted to share the ceremony with the world over the radio, NASA stymied the plan after atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair tried to sue for a previous religious broadcast.O'Hair wanted a ban on NASA astronauts practicing religion on earth, in space or 'around and about the moon' while on duty after the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2372481/Buzz-Aldrins-secret-communion-moon.html,

What the media didn’t tell us on that historic occasion was that the first food eaten, and the first liquid poured on the moon were the communion elements of bread and wine. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin chose to commemorate the awe and wonder of the moon landing in a way he found personally meaningful—by partaking of Holy Communion.He later wrote about the experience for Guideposts magazine saying:“. . . Neil would give the signal to step down the ladder onto the powdery surface of the moon. Now was the moment for communion.So I unstowed the elements in their flight packets. I put them and the scripture reading on the little table in front of the abort guidance system computer.‘Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking. I would like to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his own individual way.’”As the radio blacked out, Aldrin silently read two Bible passages that he had hand-written on a piece of paper:When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him? (Psalm 8:3,4) And Jesus said, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5)He then took communion. He reflects in his memoir “. . . I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God.”What would it be like to view planet Earth from the vantage point of the moon? How could one not be awestruck by the magnificence of our God?Perhaps it would give us just a glimpse of God’s eternal perspective.The next time you partake of communion—or sit down at a meal to eat and drink—remember with thanks that Jesus Christ paid the price with His life so that we could enjoy relationship with our Creator.In light of eternity, life here on earth . . . time . . . what you are facing today . . . grows small.Draw near to His presence.For the One who is great is in you, and through Him you can do all things.",http://www.cherylelton.com/lunar-communion/,

Last week the Macals (pronounced Motzals) talked about their experiences, she sitting in her Broken Arrow apartment and he on her laptop via Facebook Messenger from the church in Riyadh, with services going on the background. Misty was born and raised in the Tulsa area and met Brandon while they both were students at Mounds. They married in 1995, two years out of high school, and for most of the past 21 years have lived overseas while Brandon served in the U.S. Air Force. Their son, Brandon Jr., was born in Germany and their daughter, Brooklyn, in Japan. Brandon left the military in about 2004, and they returned to the Tulsa area. In 2008, Brandon announced that he had accepted a job in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as a military adviser to the Royal Saudi Air Force. “I was so mad,” Misty said. “I never expected to find myself going to a place where the Bible is banned and open Christian worship is banned. “I thought I was going to a place where I would be miserable.” Brandon moved to Riyadh, and she followed several months later with their two children. Culture shock The culture shock was severe. “As a woman, I had to wear an abaya, a full-length black gown with a head covering, whenever I was out of the house, and my daughter did too, once she was older than about 11. It was very hot. ... And I couldn’t drive.” “I got to wear shorts and flip-flops,” Brandon chimed in from 8,000 miles away. “My third week there, I had a breakdown,” she said. “I was sitting on a curb to eat a powdered doughnut because women weren’t allowed in the doughnut shop. White sugar was dropping on my abaya. I was crying like a baby. I didn’t realize that this would be my life.” “After that, I got through it, believing Jesus that I was there for a mission and a reason.” Misty said she was raised in an Assembly of God church in Sapulpa and felt called to the ministry in a powerful dream when she was a teenager. Brandon, however, had wanted nothing to do with church until he had a conversion experience while he was stationed in Tokyo. After they moved to Saudi Arabia, the couple got involved with a small group of expatriate Christians who met first monthly and then weekly, and later formed a church that met in their spacious Riyadh home. After about a year, when the group grew to 100 and became more visible, they were asked to stop meeting in the house for fear of authorities. They decided to rent a building in Riyadh for their Friday morning meetings. “It’s on our visa that we are non-Muslims,” Brandon said, “so we decided we were going to be who we are. If we get kicked out of the country, we’ll hold our head high.” Christian services in Saudi Arabia are allowed only in foreign embassies and compounds. Brandon served as administrator of the church, called Grace Outreach Riyadh, and later as pastor. Misty was the worship pastor. ‘A great achievement’ The church grew to 1,200 people, all of them expatriates, most from Asia and Africa, with a few Westerners from the United States, Europe and Australia. At one point they had members from 46 nations. Saudis were not allowed to attend, for their own safety. IDs were checked at the door. To their surprise, they have had only minimal difficulty with authorities, in part, Brandon believes, because they are open about what they are doing and cordially invite questioning authorities to visit the services. “We don’t hide what we do. We’re very transparent. Very honest,” he said. The church has a Facebook page with GPS coordinates for the services, which are live-streamed. They have told their story publicly.  “The police come by and tell us, ‘If you have any problems with anyone, call us,’ ” Misty said. She said it was a “great achievement” that they have been able to have weekly Christian music in a nation that forbids music. Brandon distributed a booklet to help Christians in Riyadh understand exactly what their rights are under Shariah law. In 2011, they had an event they think is unprecedented in Saudi Arabia: public revival services attended by about 8,000 to 10,000 people, including many people from the some 200 underground churches they say are in Riyadh. Tulsa evangelist Chresten Tomlin sang, and Greg Webb of Muskogee spoke. God’s love Misty said her attitude has changed greatly since the day she sat on a curb with a doughnut and cried. “Here you see God’s love; you are directed by God. You have fellowship with all these people. It is just an extension of God’s love that brings us together. This is what heaven is going to be like.” This summer, Misty returned to Tulsa to give her daughter the experience of living and going to school in America for her senior year. Brooklyn attends Union High School. Their son is a student at College of the Ozarks in Missouri. Brandon continues to work in Riyadh and remains active in the church, though he has stepped down as lead pastor. What will they do next? They don’t know. Both said they were eager to get back together, either in Tulsa or in Riyadh. Misty said she plans to continue to minister through preaching and singing, wherever she is.

Tawadros is the leader of Egypt’s 1.5 million Coptic Christians.“A reliable source has told Mideast Christian News that Pope Tawadros II, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of Saint Mark’s Episcopate, has reached an agreement with the Saudi ambassador in Cairo, Ahmed Kattan, to establish the first church ever built inside Saudi Arabia,” wrote Irin Moussa of Mideast Christian News.The Coptic pope meets with the Saudi ambassador (MCN Photo)“The source said that Pope Tawadros was extremely happy upon his return to the Cathedral in Al-Abbasiya, where he met with a German parliamentary delegation after the end of his first visit to the Embassy of Saudi Arabia,” wrote Moussa.“MCN was told that the Pope thanked the King of Saudi Arabia and the current government for their approval to build the first church, which will be Coptic, and for the warm welcome from the Saudi ambassador in Cairo. The source added that at the meeting, the two leaders also discussed consolidating relations between the Church and Saudi Arabia, especially after the king of Saudi Arabia pledged to send aid to Egypt after the revolution of June 30. His Holiness also expressed his condolences for the victims of the recent fire in a Medina hotel.“There are many Egyptian Copts in Saudi Arabia, and there are also more than a million Christians from Southeast Asia, particularly from the Philippines.”Indeed, the Catholic community in Saudi Arabia is overseen by the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia and has its own bishop, Camillo Ballin. However, he is not allowed to set foot in Saudi Arabia – instead has his offices at the Holy Family Cathedral in Kuwait.The existence of that church has been an irritation to the Saudis. In 2012, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia declared that all churches in the Arabian Peninsula must be destroyed.“Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah made the controversial statement in a response to a question from a Kuwaiti delegation,” reported the Russian news agency Novosti. “The Grand Mufti, who is the highest official of religious law in Saudi Arabia, as well as the head of the Supreme Council of Islamic Scholars, cited the Prophet Mohammed, who said the Arabian Peninsula is to exist under only one religion.“The Sheikh went on to conclude that it was therefore necessary for Kuwait, being a part of the Arabian Peninsula, to destroy all churches on its territory.”Ironically, the oldest church building in the world, the 4 century Jubail Church is located in Jubail, northern Saudi Arabia. “It wasdiscovered in 1986,” reports the website Above Top Secret. “The government hides it from locals and bans foreigners from visiting it, even archaeologists. It is an ancient Assyrian church possibly of the Nabatean culture.“In 1986, people on a desert picnic discovered the ruins of a church near the city of Jubail, Saudi Arabia, while digging one of their trucks out of the sand. The church is believed to have been built prior to A.D. 400, making it older than most churches in Europe. It was likely associated with one of five bishoprics existing on the shores of the Arabian Sea during the term of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople and founder of the heresy that bears his name.",http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/articles/will-saudi-arabia-finally-allow-a-church-on-its-soil.aspx,
You cant build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/09/sean-hannity/hannity-you-cant-build-christian-church-saudi-arab/,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,can not judge,Christians in Arab Gulf face hurdles to worship,"KUWAIT/DUBAI (Reuters) - Every Friday in the Muslim Gulf Arab state of Kuwait, 2,000 Christians cram into a 600-seat church or listen outside to the mass relayed on loudspeakers, prompting their Catholic bishop to worry about a stampede.“If a panic happens, it will be a catastrophe ... it is a miracle that nothing has happened,” said Bishop Camillo Ballin.These churchgoers represent only the tip of the iceberg. Ballin reckons his flock in Kuwait numbers around 350,000 out of a total of half a million Christians in the country.At least 3.5 million Christians of all denominations live in the Gulf Arab region, the birthplace of Islam and home to some of the most conservative Arab Muslim societies in the world.The freedom to practice Christianity -- or any religion other than Islam -- is not always a given in the Gulf and varies from country to country. Saudi Arabia, which applies an austere form of Sunni Islam, has by far the tightest restrictions.“In the Gulf, excluding Saudi Arabia, government attitudes are more religious tolerance than religious freedom,” said Bill Schwartz, canon of the Church of the Epiphany in Doha, Qatar, an Anglican church serving Protestants of various denominations.Christians in the Gulf are almost all expatriate workers, mostly Catholics from the Philippines and India.Christian leaders fret that their ability to worship is often compromised by lack of access or space, an issue they will raise at the Vatican next week during a synod of bishops called to discuss the fate of Christian minorities in the Middle East.The welfare of Christians in Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter and a close U.S. ally, is a pressing issue for church leaders, but progress is slow as the Saudi monarchy tussles with its powerful religious establishment over reforms.Almost all the kingdom’s clerics follow the strict Wahhabi school of Islam, and some believe non-Muslims should be barred from the Arabian peninsula, a view shared by al Qaeda which has threatened attacks against Christians in the region.In Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, any form of non-Muslim worship takes place in private. Converting Muslims is punishable by death, although such sentences are rare.Services and prayer meetings are often held in diplomats’ homes, but access to these is very limited, so Christians meet to worship in hotel conference rooms -- at great risk.This week, Saudi media said 13 Filipinos had been charged with proselytizing after a raid on a Riyadh hotel where nearly 150 people had been attending a private Roman Catholic mass.Diplomats say priests regularly visit Christians in Saudi Arabia. Even though their visas do not state their purpose, the authorities are aware of their presence.The Catholic Church, which estimates it has 1.5 million adherents in Saudi Arabia, has urged Riyadh to lift curbs on Christian worship and allow churches to be built, just as Muslims can build mosques in Western countries.The pace of change may be glacial, but Christians and rights activists note some improvements as the kingdom slowly opens up to the world and heeds international pressure on human rights.“Ten years ago a Saudi who said he was a Christian would have had his head cut off,” said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteb, head of the Saudi-based, independent First Human Rights Society.“The problem is not the government, but the religious police,” he said, referring to the morals squad that roams the streets implementing the dictates of the clergy.Elsewhere in the Gulf, things are easier, but restrictions still apply. Christian leaders say governments struggle to strike a balance between the needs of their ever-growing foreign communities and the demands of their more conservative citizens.In the United Arab Emirates, Christians may only worship in places with special licences. The authorities are slow to hand these out or to grant permission for new churches to be built.Every Friday in Dubai, the UAE’s business and tourism hub, crowds of worshippers swamp the few churches and licensed compounds.“We have something like 16,000 cars trying to park around here on a Friday,” says the Reverend Canon Stephen Wright of Christ Church Jebel Ali, an Anglican church in a compound on the outskirts of Dubai that accommodates six other denominations.Next door to Christ Church is the Dubai Evangelical Church Center, a complex of evangelical churches with big prayer halls, meeting rooms, library and an outside baptism pool.”“We’d love to have a lot of small churches across Dubai rather than one big one, but unfortunately in Dubai you can’t do that,” said Roy Verrips, the South African administrator of the United Christian Church of Dubai.He says his church has about 500 members, but the complex draws around 3,000 Christians on Fridays for services in at least six languages from Tagalog to Korean, Nepali and Chinese.“If this place wasn’t here, we wouldn’t be able to stay here. For me it’s the most essential, most significant thing that we have as believers,” said a Filipina Christian who works in Dubai as a housemaid and gave her name only as Gerry.Verrips says his members do not try to convert Muslims, something forbidden in the UAE as in most Gulf Arab countries.“We respect and work within the boundaries that they set for us,” he said, adding that his church did nonetheless encourage its members to talk to people about Christianity.Evangelical Christians who do proselytize end up creating difficulties for all the churches, as the angered authorities clamp down on everyone, several Christian leaders said.Most are grateful for the limited freedom on offer. “There’s no financial support, but otherwise I couldn’t criticize the government for not being helpful,” Qatar’s Schwartz said.“We’re just thankful for what we have,” said Verrips.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-christians-gulf-idUSTRE6972O920101008,

We’re not able to build synagogues. It’s forbidden.”On ABC’s This Week, host Christiane Amanpour held a town hall debate on whether Americans should fear Islam. Naturally, the so-called Ground Zero mosque came up. She asked the Rev. Franklin Graham about his comments after 9-11 that Islam is a “very evil and very wicked” religion, and that prompted this response:“I understand what the Muslims want to do in America,” said Graham. The push for mosques is driven by a desire to “convert as many Americans as they can to Islam,” he said. “I just don’t have the freedom to do this in most Muslim countries. We can’t have a church. We’re not able to build synagogues. It’s forbidden.”We spoke to experts on religion and government in Muslim countries. The consensus: There are churches and/or synagogues in almost every Muslim country.Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations, said Graham was incorrect. “There are lots of Christian churches and synagogues in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Qatar, Kuwait. … If you go to any number of so-called Muslim countries you will see thriving Christian and Jewish populations.” One member of the Iranian Parliament is Jewish, Hooper noted. “The only one where you don’t see it, where you can’t have a Christian church or synagogue is Saudi Arabia,” Hooper said.The cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are the two holiest cities in Islam, said Akbar S. Ahmed, chair of Islamic Studies at American University. So no churches or synagogues are allowed there. He compared them to the Vatican.Graham was speaking in the context of Muslims building mosques in order to convert people to Islam, and on that point, he is on firmer ground.A 2007 Council on Foreign Relations “backgrounder” on religious conversion and sharia law said, “Conversion by Muslims to other faiths is forbidden under most interpretations of sharia and converts are considered apostates” sometimes regarded as treason and punishable by death. Experts told us there was an ongoing debate in Islam about this question.In sum, we think Graham erred when he said that in most Muslim countries, “We can’t have a church. We’re not able to build synagogues. It’s forbidden.” That’s demonstrably false. The construction of churches is not forbidden in most Muslim countries, only Saudi Arabia.

Well, maybe not to the whole town but at least to a number of homes.While many of the doors in the Arab nation are firmly closed to him, the jolly fat man is busier than ever as underground Christmas celebrations attract more and more guests.The Kingdom, which only recognizes a strict brand of Islamic faith and practice, prohibits Christianity and its people from celebrating the holiday.However, insiders and experts claim that there are an increasing number of secret Christians – converting is illegal and punishable by death, imprisonment or lashes – and a growing number of Saudi residents celebrate Dec. 25.“The number of Christian converts from Islam and other religions is increasing, along with their boldness in sharing their new faith,” David Curry, president and CEO of Open Doors USA, a non-profit focused on assisting oppressed Christians around the world. “But they have to be careful. A lot of persecution can come from family or society, rather than the government.”The Saudi government doesn’t conduct any census about religious faith, and, officially, the percentage of Christians in the country is zero. But experts and outside groups believe that, out of around 30 million residents, there are around 1.2 million Christians – mostly expatriate migrant workers who don’t have citizenship.Recent studies have estimated that up to 4.4 percent of the population identifies as Christian, a boost from 0.1 percent at the beginning of the 20th century.But there are no churches in Saudi Arabia, and even the wearing of any kind of religious symbols is forbidden – a Christmas tree or lights outside is unthinkable. So what is the holiday season really like in Saudi Arabia?“I fly back to Saudi Arabia almost every Christmas. We pray in little groups,” said 18-year-old Laura, an Orthodox California native who spent much of her youth in Syria and Saudi Arabia and asked to be identified only by her first name.“On Christmas night, we usually celebrate at a private compound or an Embassy where only foreigners are allowed. We drink and party until six in the morning,” said Laura, who is currently studying neuroscience at the University of California, Riverside. “The Saudi Government knows about it, so long as there are no Saudis at our celebrations, we’re safe.”According to Laura, non-Saudi Muslims routinely join the Christmas festivities and take it as an opportunity to learn new things. While residents cannot have seasonal decorations outside, the inside of their homes brims with Christian symbols, Santa stockings, stars and tinsel.“We know God is watching over us, and that is why we have been safe in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia celebrating this occasion so far,” she went on. “It is very important for us to celebrate Christian occasions, because it is one of the ways we can pass on our religion to our children and to people younger than us.”Jeff King, President of the International Christian Concern (ICC), cautioned that Christmas celebrations of any kind still carry a big personal risk as people are still arrested arbitrarily for violating religious laws.“The Christmas season – often a season where Christians around the world are most visible – is a tense time for Christians in Saudi Arabia, who have to celebrate the holiday in secret, risking arrest and deportation,” he said, noting that despite pledges a decade ago to stop interfering with non-Muslim private worship, services at private homes are still targeted by officials.Some celebrators have been bold enough in recent years to post online about their Christmas festivities, much to the anger of religious leaders.In December 2012, it was reported in Arab media that Saudi Arabia’s religious police – the Mutaween – raided a private home, arresting more than 40 guests for “plotting to celebrate” the birth of Jesus.Last winter, rumors of an uptick in clandestine Christmas parties prompted the Saudi state media to reinforce that celebrating the holiday was forbidden, suggesting that for Muslims even to greet non-Muslims with a Christmas-related message was akin to “endorsing their faith.”It wasn’t always like this. Before the 7th century spread of Islam, Christians built churches across the Persian Gulf state, with one of the earliest ever church structures – dating back to the 4th century – having been discovered in Jubail by archeologists.The Apostle Paul spent time in Arabia, as did St. Thomas, and sections of the country like Najrat in the south, remained largely Christian until into the 10th century.The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) noted in its 2016 report that Saudi Arabia has improved a little when it comes to religious freedom, but that overall the situation remains dire. The U.S State Department has designated Saudi Arabia a “country of particular concern” (CPC) since 2004, but in recent years it was awarded an “indefinite waiver.”The report pointed out that “US-Saudi relations remain close” and that, since 2010, the US government has sold more than $100 billion in arms to the Kingdom. Beyond that, American and Saudi interests are deeply intertwined in fighting terrorism.So much so, religious liberty advocates say, that the U.S could afford to enforce a full, non-waiver CPC status and press the Saudi government to improve its record on religious freedom.“Saudi Arabia remains uniquely repressive in the extent to which it restricts the public expression of any religion other than Islam,” USCIRF Chair Rev. Thomas J. Reese told FoxNews.com. “USCIRF has recommended that the [Obama] administration provide a detailed report on progress and lack of progress.”Neither the US State Department nor the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington, D.C., responded to requests for comment.Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

There are no church buildings that are allowed to exist there.,Saudi Arabia Declares Destruction of All Churches in Region,"Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.Earlier this month, news reports surfaced out of Saudi Arabia that raised the red flag for Christians.Todd Nettleton, a spokesman for Voice of the Martyrs USA, says, The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia—the top Islamic official in the country of Saudi Arabia—has declared that it is 'necessary to destroy all the churches of the region.' Nettleton goes on to note that the report hasn't surfaced anywhere except on the Council on Foreign Relations Web site, which was then picked up by The Atlantic.As Saudi Arabia is ranked second on the Open Doors World Watch List (a compilation of the 50 countries where persecution of Christians is most severe), the news is not really a surprise. There is no provision for religious freedom in the constitution of this Islamic kingdom.All citizens must adhere to Islam, and conversion to another religion is punishable by death. Public Christian worship is forbidden; worshippers risk imprisonment, lashing, deportation and torture. Evangelizing Muslims and distributing non-Islamic materials is illegal. Muslims who convert to Christianity risk being subjected to honor killings, and foreign Christian workers have been exposed to abuse from employers.Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, created an implication with his assertion. Nettleton explains, This was in a meeting with Kuwaiti officials who came to Saudi Arabia. They were asking this Islamic official, ‘What should we do about the churches?' His statement was, ‘There should be no Christian churches on the Arabian Peninsula.'According to the report, the delegation wanted to confirm Shariah's position on churches. Essentially, Nettleton says, If you have churches in Kuwait, which they do, they should be destroyed. The interesting thing about this is that there are no churches in Saudi Arabia. There are no church buildings that are allowed to exist there. So he clearly wasn't talking only for his own country. He was trying to export this ideology to the surrounding countries.This proclamation could affect churches in Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Nettleton observes that in most of these countries, we're not talking about a lot of churches; we're talking about a few that are allowed to exist primarily to serve foreigners that are living in that country.However, the U.N. Human Rights Council has yet to take a stand on such blatant violations of freedom of religion. How the governments implement this declaration is yet to be determined.Most of these countries would consider their native population to be 100 percent Muslim, says Nettleton. We could see more persecution. We could see churches closed or destroyed. We just kind of wait to see now.The concern raised by this view has not escaped the notice of the U.S. government, though. The most recent International Religious Freedom report (annually issued by the State Department) remarks, Freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law and is severely restricted in practice. ... The government officially does not permit non-Muslim clergy to enter the country to conduct religious services, although some do so under other auspices and are able to hold services. These entry restrictions make it difficult for non-Muslims to maintain regular contact with clergy. This is particularly problematic for Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians, whose faiths require that they receive sacraments from a priest on a regular basis.For the most part, says Nettleton, the Mufti's statement will be buried in the mainstream media. However, he's encouraging believers to ask God to continue to intervene. There are Christ followers in Saudi Arabia who take great risk to follow Jesus Christ, he says. They take great risk to even talk about their faith with another person. We can pray for God's protection over them. We can pray for encouragement.What's more, ask God to continue His intervention. While the Arabian Peninsula isn't a place for the more traditional approach to sharing Christ's story, there are still many who are encountering the gospel.Pray that Muslims will come to know Christ, Nettleton says. One of the things that's happening, not only in Saudi Arabia but across the Middle East, is Muslims encountering Christ through dreams and visions and other supernatural ways.Charisma Readers save 50% OFF these select Bibles plus FREE SHIPPING plus a Special Bonus for a limited time!

Hence, Christians and even Muslims of other sects, face severe restrictions.Christians make up only about 3% of the population, but they have no churches and never display their faith in public.",Living in Secret As a Catholic in Saudi Arabia,"Interview With Scholar on Churches in the Middle EastSaudi Arabia is considered holy ground by the Muslim majority who live there. Hence, Christians and even Muslims of other sects, face severe restrictions.Christians make up only about 3% of the population, but they have no churches and never display their faith in public.Professor Camille Eid, a journalist, author, professor at the University of Milan and expert on the Churches of the Middle East, spoke about the Saudi Arabia situation with the television program “Where God Weeps” of the Catholic Radio and Television Network (CRTN) in cooperation with Aid to the Church in Need.Q: Saudi Arabia is a hereditary monarchy based on the foundation of Wahhabi Islam. What is this branch of Islam?Eid: Wahhabism is a new doctrine of Islam. Its founder is Abd-al Wahhab, who was a religious scholar of Hanafi Islam, which is the strictest doctrine of Islam. He decided that all innovations — “Bida” is the term in Arabic — in Islam should be eliminated. A visit to a cemetery for instance is considered a bida-innovation and is prohibited. You cannot do anything that the Prophet Mohammed and his companions did not do. So the alliance between the followers of Wahhabi and the prince of Najd in central Arabia created the birth of this Saudi Arabian kingdom. Saudi Arabia takes its name from the Saud family. This house of Saud alliance with the Wahhabi sect is still true today and the successors of the kingdom follow this strict instruction and doctrine of Wahhabism; the laws of the kingdom follow the strict guidelines of Wahhabism.Q: What about the Shia?Eid: The Shia make up almost 10% of the population and they face much discrimination. They are concentrated mainly in the eastern part of the kingdom. There is another sect of the Shia, the Ismaili, and they are very near the Yemeni border. The kingdom and its leadership subscribe to Wahhabism.Q: The Quran is Saudi Arabia’s constitution. What position does the Quran or this constitution take toward non-Muslims?Eid: The Quran distinguishes between Christians and Jews, and other unbelievers. Christians and Jews are called the “People of the Book,” or the books if you want — the Gospel and the Torah. Sometimes in the Quran, Christians are described in a very positive way. The Christian monarch and priests pray. But, during the second period in the Prophet’s revelation, Christians are described as unbelievers and [it’s said they] should pay the “Jizya,” the tax necessary to be protected in an Islamic society. There seems to be a contradiction in the book itself. That is why we have a liberal and a violent Islam. The violent Islam is a result of the second revelation that occurred during the last reign of Mohammed and as a result the current Islamic societies state that the events of the second revelation should be followed and not the previous revelations, which are more tolerant.Q: The government is built on the principles of Sharia. What is Sharia? Eid: Sharia is the summa of the Quran, the Hadith, which are the statements of Mohammed, and other sources such as the Ishma, which is the consensus of all Islamic scholars (Ulema). Sharia Law is taken from all these.Q: All residents who live in Saudi Arabia are subjected to the law of Sharia?Eid: All residents are subjected to this law and you cannot object because it is tantamount to objecting to Islam. Upon arrival at the airport you are informed immediately that you are to abide by the strict Islamic laws. I as a Christian, for instance, had a Pepsi in my hand during Ramadan. I noticed that everybody was looking at me in a certain way and they could have beaten me. You cannot eat outside or in public during the fast. You can only eat in secret. So you have to observe the fast even if you are not Muslim because that is the law.Q: Christians constitute the biggest non-Muslim group in Saudi Arabia. How do Christians live their faith in Saudi Arabia?Eid: In secret. It is forbidden to have Bibles, religious images and rosaries; if they are detected at the airport they are immediately confiscated. There was an instance when I was at the Jeddah Airport with a videocassette and they asked to view this cassette. The video was about Spartacus. I was suddenly fearful that they would see the image of the crucifixion. The guard eventually allowed it because it was a soldier being crucified and not Jesus Christ. … It is hard. They say that Christians can pray privately but what does private mean? Does it mean alone or with your family? When more than two, or a group of families, are praying together in the privacy of their home the religious police can come in and intervene and arrest them.Q: What happens to the Christian that is caught with a rosary in their pocket or wearing a cross?Eid: If it is in a pocket nobody can see it. If, however you are seen wearing a cross, any Muslim — and not just the police — can take it away. You will be arrested and risk expulsion from the kingdom. They will haul you to prison and after a few days you will be issued an exit visa. It will be over for you.Q: What other kind of Christian activities are punishable by law?Eid: All public manifestation of any faith other than Islam is punishable. They do know that the Americans, French and Italians celebrate the Mass for Christmas and Easter inside the embassies but because the embassy is extra-territorial, the law does not apply. The police, however, are around to monitor. There are no churches, synagogues or temples in the kingdom. All manifestations of other faiths are prohibited.Eid: You have 5,000 religious police divided among 100 districts, but any Muslim can enforce the law by denouncing the individual. I spent two and half years in Jeddah; I was afraid to extend the Easter and Christmas greetings even via phone because I was afraid that someone might be listening. The religious police control everything including the bookshops because it is prohibited to sell any card with non-Muslim themes. Some years ago in the American school, a Santa Claus was almost arrested but he managed to escape through a window. It is prohibited.Q: Are Christians a particular target of persecution or discrimination?Eid: Not just Christians but the non-Wahhabi versions of Islam such as the Shia or Ismaili. Not all Christian communities suffer equally. American, Italian, French and British — in fact most Europeans and other First World countries — suffer less because they know that these countries are powerful and will intervene immediately to protect their citizens. So they target the Christians of the Third World like Eritrea, India and the Philippines. These countries fear the loss of revenue from their citizens living in the kingdom. So they target the Christians of these weaker Third World countries.Q: It has been said that Filipino maids have been accused of communicating the faith to the children of the wealthy Saudis that employ them. Do you know anything about this?Eid: The Islamic catechism talks about the risk of communicating faith. The Saudi version states: “When you go abroad you should not develop a relationship or friendship with your professors because you should remember that they are infidels.” This criterion also applies to the Filipino women in Saudi Arabia. Any communication can only occur by testimony not by words.Eid: Only through witness and that is why they have suggested substituting Filipinos, or Christian women in general, with Egyptian, Moroccan or Algerian women so that they cannot communicate the faith to the children.Q: We have talked about discrimination. We have talked about persecution. How far can this persecution go?Eid: To death. We have a case of the martyrdom of a Saudi girl who converted to Christianity. Her brother discovered her. She wrote a poem to Christ and she had her tongue cut, she disappeared and was later found dead. Her name was Fatima Al-Mutairi and this happened in August of 2008. In 2008 two cases of raids by the religious police saw men, women and children less than 3 years old arrested. We have many reports of torture; before they are deported to their country these Filipinos, Indians and Eritreans are tortured by the police in the prisons.Q: You mentioned the case of Fatima who converted to Christianity. What is the number of Muslims converting? Do you have any information or is it impossible to know?Eid: It is not possible. Saudi society is difficult to penetrate because the regime monitors every activity. Sometimes you notice this from the women’s perspective. When these Saudi women go abroad, even upon entry in the airplane, they remove the hijab. In Lebanon and other countries they drink alcohol. When they return to their country they know that that have to abide by the laws.Eid: Christian converts do exist. I follow the Arabic media channels, which broadcast to Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab world, and during the transmission many calls originate from Saudi Arabia. Those converts who travel to Morocco and Egypt talk about their experience but do not mention their names and request only that the Christian community pray for them because they desire to see the day when they will be allowed to go to a church, to be able to have access to the Gospels and to be able to share their new faith with their own family. If a convert informs his/her brother or father of his/her new faith, he or she faces the danger of being charged with treason by the family; a treason not only of one’s family but also to the nation and society in general. Apostasy is a question of honor and as such it is considered treason.Q: Professor Samir Khalil Samir, an Egyptian Quran scholar, stated that within the Quran, there is no obligation to kill an apostate. Where does this expression of violence come from?Eid: Exactly. In the 14th [book] of the Quran there is talk about apostasy but there is no talk of a penalty in this life but rather in the second life. This change comes from the Hadith of Mohammed in which he said that whomever changes religion should be killed. But a problem again arises from this, because with the thousands of Hadith, there is no proof that Mohammed actually said this. Many Islamic countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran and Yemen, and so on, apply the death penalty based on a Hadith that can’t be a hundred percent proven that it is from Mohammed.Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the lay Catholics living in Saudi Arabia?Eid: It is hard to be a lay Catholic in Saudi Arabia because you have to have a very deep background in your faith. You cannot have copies of the Gospel in your home. You cannot have a rosary. You cannot have contact with your Christian friends as a community; you can have Christian friends, you can frequent the foreign communities but you are prohibited from talking about your faith. So the only possibility is to have a strong awareness and knowledge of your faith that you can bank on in this environment. In other Islamic countries Friday is a holiday so Mass as a community [is allowed], but not on Sunday because Sunday is considered a working day; but even this is not the case in Saudi Arabia. So you are a community by yourself. Usually you do not even have your own family because Saudi Arabia has restrictions on family reunification. If you have a daughter who is more than 18 years of age, she cannot stay in Saudi Arabia if she is not married. So most have their families somewhere else. So you are alone and with no contact to other Catholics, which is very hard, and so you have to have the strength of faith in your heart; to be able to pray with out the prayer books, to just know and pray the prayers you have learned by heart from your childhood.This interview was conducted by Mark Riedemann for “Where God Weeps,” a weekly TV & radio show produced by Catholic Radio & Television Network in conjunction with the international Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need.",https://timothyandtitus.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/living-in-secret-as-a-catholic-in-saudia-arabia/,

Hence, Christians and even Muslims of other sects, face severe restrictions.Christians make up only about 3% of the population, but they have no churches and never display their faith in public.",Living in Secret in Saudi Arabia – ZENIT – English,"ROME, APRIL 4, 2011 (Zenit.org).- Saudi Arabia is considered holy ground by the Muslim majority who live there. Hence, Christians and even Muslims of other sects, face severe restrictions.Christians make up only about 3% of the population, but they have no churches and never display their faith in public.Professor Camille Eid, a journalist, author, professor at the University of Milan and expert on the Churches of the Middle East, spoke about the Saudi Arabia situation with the television program “Where God Weeps” of the Catholic Radio and Television Network (CRTN) in cooperation with Aid to the Church in Need.Q: Saudi Arabia is a hereditary monarchy based on the foundation of Wahhabi Islam. What is this branch of Islam?Eid: Wahhabism is a new doctrine of Islam. Its founder is Abd-al Wahhab, who was a religious scholar of Hanafi Islam, which is the strictest doctrine of Islam. He decided that all innovations — “Bida” is the term in Arabic — in Islam should be eliminated. A visit to a cemetery for instance is considered a bida-innovation and is prohibited. You cannot do anything that the Prophet Mohammed and his companions did not do. So the alliance between the followers of Wahhabi and the prince of Najd in central Arabia created the birth of this Saudi Arabian kingdom. Saudi Arabia takes its name from the Saud family. This house of Saud alliance with the Wahhabi sect is still true today and the successors of the kingdom follow this strict instruction and doctrine of Wahhabism; the laws of the kingdom follow the strict guidelines of Wahhabism.Q: What about the Shia?Eid: The Shia make up almost 10% of the population and they face much discrimination. They are concentrated mainly in the eastern part of the kingdom. There is another sect of the Shia, the Ismaili, and they are very near the Yemeni border. The kingdom and its leadership subscribe to Wahhabism.Q: The Quran is Saudi Arabia’s constitution. What position does the Quran or this constitution take toward non-Muslims?Eid: The Quran distinguishes between Christians and Jews, and other unbelievers. Christians and Jews are called the “People of the Book,” or the books if you want — the Gospel and the Torah. Sometimes in the Quran, Christians are described in a very positive way. The Christian monarch and priests pray. But, during the second period in the Prophet’s revelation, Christians are described as unbelievers and [it’s said they] should pay the “Jizya,” the tax necessary to be protected in an Islamic society. There seems to be a contradiction in the book itself. That is why we have a liberal and a violent Islam. The violent Islam is a result of the second revelation that occurred during the last reign of Mohammed and as a result the current Islamic societies state that the events of the second revelation should be followed and not the previous revelations, which are more tolerant.Q: The government is built on the principles of Sharia. What is Sharia?Eid: Sharia is the summa of the Quran, the Hadith, which are the statements of Mohammed, and other sources such as the Ishma, which is the consensus of all Islamic scholars (Ulema). Sharia Law is taken from all these.Q: All residents who live in Saudi Arabia are subjected to the law of Sharia?Eid: All residents are subjected to this law and you cannot object because it is tantamount to objecting to Islam. Upon arrival at the airport you are informed immediately that you are to abide by the strict Islamic laws. I as a Christian, for instance, had a Pepsi in my hand during Ramadan. I noticed that everybody was looking at me in a certain way and they could have beaten me. You cannot eat outside or in public during the fast. You can only eat in secret. So you have to observe the fast even if you are not Muslim because that is the law.Q: Christians constitute the biggest non-Muslim group in Saudi Arabia. How do Christians live their faith in Saudi Arabia?Eid: In secret. It is forbidden to have Bibles, religious images and rosaries; if they are detected at the airport they are immediately confiscated. There was an instance when I was at the Jeddah Airport with a videocassette and they asked to view this cassette. The video was about Spartacus. I was suddenly fearful that they would see the image of the crucifixion. The guard eventually allowed it because it was a soldier being crucified and not Jesus Christ. … It is hard. They say that Christians can pray privately but what does private mean? Does it mean alone or with your family? When more than two, or a group of families, are praying together in the privacy of their home the religious police can come in and intervene and arrest them.Q: What happens to the Christian that is caught with a rosary in their pocket or wearing a cross?Eid: If it is in a pocket nobody can see it. If, however you are seen wearing a cross, any Muslim — and not just the police — can take it away. You will be arrested and risk expulsion from the kingdom. They will haul you to prison and after a few days you will be issued an exit visa. It will be over for you.Q: What other kind of Christian activities are punishable by law?Eid: All public manifestation of any faith other than Islam is punishable. They do know that the Americans, French and Italians celebrate the Mass for Christmas and Easter inside the embassies but because the embassy is extra-territorial, the law does not apply. The police, however, are around to monitor. There are no churches, synagogues or temples in the kingdom. All manifestations of other faiths are prohibited.Eid: You have 5,000 religious police divided among 100 districts, but any Muslim can enforce the law by denouncing the individual. I spent two and half years in Jeddah; I was afraid to extend the Easter and Christmas greetings even via phone because I was afraid that someone might be listening. The religious police control everything including the bookshops because it is prohibited to sell any card with non-Muslim themes. Some years ago in the American school, a Santa Claus was almost arrested but he managed to escape through a window. It is prohibited.Q: Are Christians a particular target of persecution or discrimination?Eid: Not just Christians but the non-Wahhabi versions of Islam such as the Shia or Ismaili. Not all Christian communities suffer equally. American, Italian, French and British — in fact most Europeans and other First World countries — suffer less because they know that these countries are powerful and will intervene immediately to protect their citizens. So they target the Christians of the Third World like Eritrea, India and the Philippines. These countries fear the loss of revenue from their citizens living in the kingdom. So they target the Christians of these weaker Third World countries.Q: It has been said that Filipino maids have been accused of communicating the faith to the children of the wealthy Saudis that employ them. Do you know anything about this?Eid: The Islamic catechism talks about the risk of communicating faith. The Saudi version states: “When you go abroad you should not develop a relationship or friendship with your professors because you should remember that they are infidels.” This criterion also applies to the Filipino women in Saudi Arabia. Any communication can only occur by testimony not by words.Eid: Only through witness and that is why they have suggested substituting Filipinos, or Christian women in general, with Egyptian, Moroccan or Algerian women so that they cannot communicate the faith to the children.Q: We have talked about discrimination. We have talked about persecution. How far can this persecution go?Eid: To death. We have a case of the martyrdom of a Saudi girl who converted to Christianity. Her brother discovered her. She wrote a poem to Christ and she had her tongue cut, she disappeared and was later found dead. Her name was Fatima Al-Mutairi and this happened in August of 2008. In 2008 two cases of raids by the religious police saw men, women and children less than 3 years old arrested. We have many reports of torture; before they are deported to their country these Filipinos, Indians and Eritreans are tortured by the police in the prisons.Q: You mentioned the case of Fatima who converted to Christianity. What is the number of Muslims converting? Do you have any information or is it impossible to know?Eid: It is not possible. Saudi society is difficult to penetrate because the regime monitors every activity. Sometimes you notice this from the women’s perspective. When these Saudi women go abroad, even upon entry in the airplane, they remove the hijab. In Lebanon and other countries they drink alcohol. When they return to their country they know that that have to abide by the laws.Eid: Christian converts do exist. I follow the Arabic media channels, which broadcast to Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab world, and during the transmission many calls originate from Saudi Arabia. Those converts who travel to Morocco and Egypt talk about their experience but do not mention their names and request only that the Christian community pray for them because they desire to see the day when they will be allowed to go to a church, to be able to have access to the Gospels and to be able to share their new faith with their own family. If a convert informs his/her brother or father of his/her new faith, he or she faces the danger of being charged with treason by the family; a treason not only of one’s family but also to the nation and society in general. Apostasy is a question of honor and as such it is considered treason.Q: Professor Samir Khalil Samir, an Egyptian Quran scholar, stated that within the Quran, there is no obligation to kill an apostate. Where does this expression of violence come from?Eid: Exactly. In the 14th [book] of the Quran there is talk about apostasy but there is no talk of a penalty in this life but rather in the second life. This change comes from the Hadith of Mohammed in which he said that whomever changes religion should be killed. But a problem again arises from this, because with the thousands of Hadith, there is no proof that Mohammed actually said this. Many Islamic countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran and Yemen, and so on, apply the death penalty based on a Hadith that can’t be a hundred percent proven that it is from Mohammed.Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the lay Catholics living in Saudi Arabia?Eid: It is hard to be a lay Catholic in Saudi Arabia because you have to have a very deep background in your faith. You cannot have copies of the Gospel in your home. You cannot have a rosary. You cannot have contact with your Christian friends as a community; you can have Christian friends, you can frequent the foreign communities but you are prohibited from talking about your faith. So the only possibility is to have a strong awareness and knowledge of your faith that you can bank on in this environment.In other Islamic countries Friday is a holiday so Mass as a community [is allowed], but not on Sunday because Sunday is considered a working day; but even this is not the case in Saudi Arabia. So you are a community by yourself. Usually you do not even have your own family because Saudi Arabia has restrictions on family reunification. If you have a daughter who is more than 18 years of age, she cannot stay in Saudi Arabia if she is not married. So most have their families somewhere else. So you are alone and with no contact to other Catholics, which is very hard, and so you have to have the strength of faith in your heart; to be able to pray with out the prayer books, to just know and pray the prayers you have learned by heart from your childhood.This interview was conducted by Mark Riedemann for “Where God Weeps,” a weekly TV & radio show produced by Catholic Radio & Television Network in conjunction with the international Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need.Aid to the Church in Need: www.acn-intl.org",https://zenit.org/articles/living-in-secret-in-saudi-arabia/,

Public non-Muslim worship is absolutely forbidden, and conversion to Christianity – perceived apostasy – is punishable by death.",Top 10 Most Dangerous Countries for Christians,"Some think Christianity’s flawed past and modern emphasis on grace and forgiveness make it an easy (perhaps deserving) target for criticism, and even reverse discrimination. Scathing rhetoric is part of any healthy debate, but should it go so far as to turn a blind eye? Christianity may have become one of the world’s predominant religions, but there are still many places where Christians are persecuted, dispossessed, tortured and even killed for their faith. Often this occurs as part of governmental or religious policy. Western media frequently under-report these incidents, fearing to offend cultural sensibilities. As a result, much of this news must be culled from secular human rights publications and religious watchdog groups. Submitted for your approval are the Top 10 Most Dangerous Countries for Christians, as ranked by the Open Doors World Watch List. 10 Laos Population: 6.4 million; 200,000 Christians Main Religion: Buddhism Government: Communist StateThe Laotian government’s attitude towards Christians is openly hostile. Lao authorities, along with many in Lao society, view Protestant Christianity (and Hmong Christians in particular) as an American threat to Communist rule. Christian churches cannot operate freely, and Christians are restricted in their family and community roles. Many Laotian believers endure extreme physical and emotional pressure to abandon their faith. Case in point: in 2010, 29 Christians were killed, and at least 20 were arrested and held without trial, while several churches were destroyed. In January of that same year, 11 Christian families in Laos’ Saravan province were driven out of their villages and into the forest, after refusing to deny their faith. 9 Uzbekistan Uzbek Women Allege Forced Sterilization-460X307Population: 27.5 million; 208,600 Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: RepublicPressure on Uzbek Christians increased last year. The number of raids on churches spiked, and fines for illegal religious activities now exceed 100 times the minimum monthly wage. Short-term prison sentences (3-15 days) are frequently meted out as a punishment for Christian religious activities, and 27 year-old Baptist missionary Tohar Haydarov has been sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment on (likely trumped up) drugs charges. An appeal is being prepared for his release.Many churches have also lost their registration and some of their buildings in 2010 as well. Recent Christian converts also experience job loss, beatings, social rejection and often expulsion from the family home. 8 Iraq Population: 30.7 million; 334,000 Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: Parliamentary democracyDon’t be fooled by all those American soldiers: violence against Christians in Iraq is on the rise, with large numbers of believers killed and injured. ‘Targeted killings’ of Christians in Mosul during the run-up to the March 2010 election, led many Christians to flee their villages and settle in the Nineveh plains. Fears of a ‘Christian ghetto’ in Baghdad were born that day. Pope Benedict XVI even made an appeal for the safety of Iraqi Christians during this time.Attacks on church buildings and Christian institutions also increased in the latter half of 2010, and at least 58 Christians were killed in a bomb attack on a Baghdad church during an evening Mass, in October of that year. 7 Yemen Population: 23.6 million; very few Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: RepublicYemen’s state religion is Islam, and sharia law is the source of all legal matters. Foreigners do have limited religious freedom, but evangelism of any kind is strictly prohibited. Case in point: several expatriate workers were deported, in 2010, for discussing Christianity with (well-meaning) Muslims who asked about it.Moreover, Yemenis are not allowed to leave Islam; those who convert to Christianity face persecution from family, authorities and extremist groups. Worse, terrorist movements and separatists made Yemen very unstable recently. Christian aid worker Johannes Hentschel, his wife Sabine and their young children Lydia, Anna and Simon, along with married British engineer Anthony Saunders were among nine foreigners abducted in in the north-western Yemeni province of Saada. Last year Anna and Lydia (3 and 5 years old respectively) were rescued by security forces from neighboring Saudi Arabia. But the Saudis also found the bodies of three other abducted Christians, German Bible students Rita Stumpp, Anita Gruenwald, and South Korean teacher, Eom Young Sun. German and British investigators have since ended their active search for the other hostages.6 Maldives Population: 311,000; very few Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: RepublicAll citizens must be Muslims in Maldives, as sharia law forbids practicing of any religion except Islam. Christian churches are forbidden, and importing Christian literature into the country is strictly prohibited. New regulations governing religious practice were unveiled by the government in 2010, and stricter policies have been imposed on tourists after some were discovered with Bibles. The few indigenous believers in Maldives are isolated from one other and are closely monitored by the law enforcement , religious authorities, and locals. 5 Somalia Somali Woman Walks Past A Church Destroyed By Fighting In Mogadishu January 6, 2008Population: 9.1 million; very few Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: Charitably described as ‘Transitional’Somalia as a “country” has been without an effective central government since 1991. It’s dangerous for anyone to live there, but doubly dangerous to be a Christian. At least fifteen Christians were killed by Islamist insurgents Al-Shabaab, in 2009, and they killed at least another eight Christians, in 2010. So it’s no wonder a quarter of all Christians have already fled the country. The few believers remaining are heavily persecuted and must practice their faith in secret, lest they be murdered in front of their children, like Christian convert Osman Abdullah Fataho.Al-Shabaab has taken control of most of southern Somalia, and they have a stated goal to wipe out Christianity from all of Somalia. However, recent indications hint they may be losing popularity. 4 Saudi Arabia Population: 25.7 million; 565,400 Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: MonarchyThere is no religious freedom in the Islamic kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Public non-Muslim worship is absolutely forbidden, and conversion to Christianity – perceived apostasy – is punishable by death. Most Christians there are monitored foreign workers who are allowed to worship privately within isolated ‘foreigner’ compounds, and even then they sometimes face difficulty. For example, twelve Filipino Christians and a priest were arrested while attending a service in a private home, in October 2010. They were verbally charged with ‘blaspheming against Islam” and cordially banned for life from Saudi Arabia (quiet deportations are a new tactic of the religious police – it avoids the media scrutiny that heavy-handed arrests generate).Saudi believers fear being open about their faith, even with their family. There have also been reports of several Christians being physically harmed for their faith, in 2010. 3 Afghanistan Population: 28.15 million; few Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: Islamic RepublicOpen Christians in Afghanistan face constant pressure from family, society and government agents. Believers usually keep a very low profile, and never meet together publicly. In June 2010, the deputy secretary of Parliament called for the execution of Christian converts, after seeing baptisms of Afghan Christians on an Afghan television (correction—THE Afghan television). As a result, many Christians have gone into hiding, and, in August 2010, the Taliban shot and killed ten members of a Christian medical team that had been providing eye treatment and other health care in remote villages of northern Afghanistan.2 Iran Iranelecprot-DsPopulation: 74.2 million; 450,000 Christians Main Religion: Islam Government: Islamic RepublicThere was a sharp increase in the number of Christians arrested in Iran during 2010. Although some were later released, pressure on the Christian church remains very high. Many of the approximately 450,000 believers from Muslim backgrounds live in fear of harassment by the government. Even worse, the regime has lost a great deal of credibility following the social upheaval of the 2009 elections, and subsequent demonstrations. In a transparent effort to distract attention from continuing protests, the Iranian government has been lashing out against Christians with even greater fervor.1 North Korea Population: 20 million; 400,000 Christians Main Religion: Atheism Government: Dynastic Communist DictatorshipNorth Korea’s persecution of Christians knows no equal, and being a Christian there is considered one of the worst crimes possible. North Korean communist dogma considers religion an ‘opiate’ of the people, unless of course that religion is the personality cult of ‘Great Leader’ Kim Il Sung or his son, ‘Dear Leader’ Kim Jong Il. North Korean Christians must hide their faith at all times, and Christian parents can’t teach their faith to their children until the kids are old enough to understand the dangers (and for parents to be sure their kids won’t turn them in). Just owning a Bible in North Korea is grounds for execution or deportment to a harsh labor camp (essentially a gulag). In 2010, hundreds of Christians were arrested: some were publicly executed, while others were sentenced to labor camps. Despite the risks, the Christian church is growing: an estimated 400,000 believers now sing silent hymns in cramped basements of crumbling buildings.",https://listverse.com/2011/11/24/top-10-most-dangerous-countries-for-christians/,

Should Christians consider Muhammad a prophet? Some Saudi experts seem to think so and want to build dialogue on blackmail (a church in Saudi Arabia in exchange of a profession of faith about the prophet Muhammad). Christianity and Islam are however different and sometimes opposed to one another. Instead of syncretism or blackmail, the only path is that of mutual respect. Beirut (AsiaNews) – Last 20 March various news agencies reported the following news from Riyadh: “No churches should be permitted in Saudi Arabia, unless Pope Benedict XVI recognised the prophet Mohammed.” This is the proposal put forward by some mediators in Riyadh who are negotiating with Vatican authorities the possibility of building a Catholic place of worship in the kingdom.Anwar Ashiqi, president of the Saudi Centre for Middle East Strategic Studies, expressed this view in an interview on the site of Arab satellite TV network, al-Arabiya.“I haven taken part in several meetings related to Islamic-Christian dialogue and there have been negotiations on this issue,” he said. “It would be possible to launch official negotiations to construct a church in Saudi Arabia only after the Pope and all the Christian Churches recognise the prophet Mohammed.”** * *There is some misunderstanding that must be cleared up. Sheikh Anwar Ashiqi said: “Since our religion recognises the Christian religion and the figures of Jesus, Moses and other prophets . . .”Does Islam recognise the Christian religion and the figure of Jesus? What does “recognises the Christian religion” mean? If it means that it “recognises the truth of the Christian religion as it defines itself,” then Islam is no longer Islam. How can Anwar Ashiqi recognise the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Redemption and every Christian dogma when the Qur’an clearly denies them?It denies the Trinity (“O followers of the Book! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against Allah, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Jesus son of Meriem is only an apostle of Allah and His Word which He communicated to Meriem and a spirit from Him; believe therefore in Allah and His apostles, and say not, Three. Desist, it is better for you; Allah is only one God; far be It from His glory that He should have a son,” Qur‘an, 4:171). It denies Christ’s divinity (“O Jesus son of Meriem! Did you say to men, Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah”? Qur‘an, 5:116). It denies Christ’s death on the cross (“they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so,” Qur‘an, 4:157). In short the Qur‘an and Muslims deny the essential dogmas of Christianity. And this is Muslims’ most absolute right!What does it mean that Islam “recognises the figures of Jesus, Moses and other prophets”? The Qur‘an presents a Jesus all of its own, which coincides with the Gospels in some respects, but not in others. Some might even find the Qur‘anic version of Jesus more beautiful than that of the Gospels. What matters though, is the fact that it does not coincide with the one found in the Gospels. And this Muslims’ most absolute right provided that it is clear that we are talking about the Qur‘anic version of Jesus!And the same can be said about those whom Muslims call “prophets”, i.e. Biblical figures who are not necessarily prophets. As for the great prophets of the Bible (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, etc.) they are not even mentioned in either the Qur‘an or the Sunnah.Can the Pope and Christians recognise Muhammad as prophet?What does it mean “the Pope and all the Christian Churches” must recognise the “Prophet Muhammad?” What has the Pope got to do with “all the Christian Churches?” since the issue is only about the eventual building of a church for Catholics, which was the request made last 6 December during the meeting between the Pope and King Abdallah. What authority does the Pope have anyway over other Churches . . . or vice versa!But the strangest thing of all is the request that the Pope recognise Muhammad’s prophetic character. How do you do that? How do you recognise that he is the “seal of the prophets” to quote the Qur‘anic expression that runs through the Muslim tradition? How can Christians believe at the same time that Christ is the Word of God, God’s final message to humanity, the Divine Word incarnate, and that after him God, his Father, sent another prophet to seal the Revelation, i.e. complete, correct, contradict what is said about him in the Gospels?In addition to questions about dogmas, there is a principle of coherence and non self-contradiction that prevents the Pope as a simple believer to assert that Muhammad was sent by God to the whole world (rather than just the Arabs) to proclaim the divine Message put in Abraham’s heart (a Muslim according to the Qur‘an) and fully revealed in him.I can understand that Muslims might feel bad about the fact that no Christian in his or her right mind can proclaim that God has sent messengers after Christ, unless only to follow Christ, imitate him and proclaim his message. Indeed for Muslims this might be seen as a kind of injustice. After all, “we recognise Jesus as prophet of God, why can’t you recognise Muhammad as a prophet of God?”The answer is that it is not a matter of mutual favours: “I give you this and you give me that!” We are not in a market. It is about our own sincerely and honestly held faith, which is not meant to attack or humiliate anyone, but only to avoid falling into hypocrisy or doubletalk.As a Christian I cannot ask Muslims to believe in Christ’s divinity in exchange for recognising Muhammad’s prophetic nature. If a Muslim was willing to do that, he should then get baptised and become a Christian. By the same token, if a Christian recognised Muhammad as a prophet he should be recognised as a Muslim.Why? Because one is a Muslim if one makes the dual profession of faith: “""I testify that there is no god worthy of worship but God (Allah), and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God.”Now, we bear witness to the first every day; if I add the second I irremediably become Muslim.Can one be Muslim and Christian?I would like very much to be both Muslim and Christian, but it cannot be done, because on some points the two religions are not just different but they are opposed. And this is not something bad. As Muhammad said to the disbelievers in the Qur’an: “You shall have your religion and I shall have my religion.” The important thing is the respect we have for one another. More than respect, it is affection and love.Dear Muslim brother, God loves you as he loves all other human creatures. Be faithful to your faith, and push me to be faithful to mine. I too have a duty to be faithful to my faith and to push you to be faithful to yours. But you cannot blackmail anyone by saying: “No churches should be permitted in Saudi Arabia, unless Pope Benedict XVI recognised the prophet Mohammed!” By the same token no one ought to be blackmailed, saying: ‘If Muslims do not recognise the figure of Christ, Son of God, there shall be no mosque in the West.”True tolerance means recognising the other as he or she is, not as one would like them to be! You cannot recognise the divinity of Christ (even though is an essential dogma for Christians) and I cannot recognise Muhammad’s prophetic nature (even though it is an essential dogma for Muslims).I can however try to understand why it is fundamental for you that Muhammad be God’s prophet, indeed the “seal of prophets”, and for this reason respect the figure of Muhammad. And you could try to understand why it is fundamental for me that Christ be the “Son of God” and for this reason respect the figure of Jesus. Should this be the case we can live together as good friends or even as brothers, having recognised that we are different and yet happy about that difference.",http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Christian-and-Muslims-or-how-to-live-together-with-different-dogmas-11898.html,
If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/01/3-8-percent-sales-tax-real-estate-health-care/,False,False,False,True,False,False,"When we first reported on this e-mail last year, we rated the chain e-mail's claim Pants on Fire, because it was written to deceive people into thinking that all home sales would be taxed. That wasn't the case then, and it's still not the case. Only high-earners will have to pay the tax, and then only if profits from the housing sale exceed the legal exemptions from taxes.",A 3.8 percent 'sales tax' on real estate transactions for health care?,"It's an e-mail that's been popping up in our inbox again and again lately, with readers all asking the same question: Can this possibly be true?  The chain e-mail claims that real estate transactions will be taxed to pay for the new health care law supported by President Barack Obama and other Democrats.  Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home etc. When did this happen? It's in the health care bill. Just thought you should know. ...  The bulk of these new taxes don't kick in until 2013. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes.  The e-mail then urges you to click over to a blog entry from the Republicans in Congress from back in April that makes a similar argument.  We've seen and ruled on this e-mail before, but because it continues to bubble up, we thought it would be useful to reiterate our earlier ruling.Both the chain e-mail and the blog post are deceptive, and here's why:  Instead of being a sales tax on all real estate transactions, the 3.8 percent tax is actually a tax on investment income for the wealthy. It applies only to the investment income of single taxpayers who make more than $200,000 or couples who make more than $250,000. (We looked it up in Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled Unearned income Medicare contribution.)  Still, maybe empty-nesters are scared they'll be hit with this tax if they sell their homes for more than $250,000. But that's not a likely scenario for most tax payers, because there's a long-standing tax exemption on the profits from home sales.  To be hit with the new tax, you would have to clear more than $250,000 in profit off your home, which means at least $250,000 more than you paid for it. And the ceiling is even higher for a married couple. Married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit from home sales. Again, that's profit, not the sales price.  When we first reported on this e-mail last year, we rated the chain e-mail's claim Pants on Fire, because it was written to deceive people into thinking that all home sales would be taxed. That wasn't the case then, and it's still not the case. Only high-earners will have to pay the tax, and then only if profits from the housing sale exceed the legal exemptions from taxes.  We're not the only ones to have debunked the chain e-mail's claims. Factcheck.org concluded in April that the tax falls on relatively few — those with high incomes from other sources.  The urban legends site Snopes.com also debunked the claim that it was a tax on all real estate sales.  To be sure, the health care law does include new taxes. But the taxes won't hit most retirees looking to downsize their homes, except those who are also among the nation's highest earners. Because it seems aimed at scaring older Americans, we rated the e-mail's claim Pants on Fire.

Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? the e-mails says. That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc. the e-mail says, adding that under the new health care bill, all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax.  The e-mail, circulating now in Rhode Island, directs recipients to GOP.gov, the Website of the Republican majority in Congress. It also encourages recipients to forward the message to everyone in their address books.  It turns out that versions of this e-mail have been around for a few years, sparked by a provision in the new health care law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare, that is designed to cover some costs of the program.  In April 2010, Snopes.com declared it False and FactCheck.org determined that it was bogus, a massive misstatement of a tax that would fall on relatively few people.  And one year ago, national PolitiFact gave it a Pants on Fire because it was so deceptive.  Because the e-mail has gotten new life in Rhode Island, we thought we’d remind people about the facts behind this claim.  First of all, the 3.8-percent tax the e-mail cites, due to take effect next year, doesn't apply to taxpayers making less than $200,000 in the year of the sale. (The limit for couples is $250,000 in adjusted gross income.) Any profit from the house sale is not included in the income calculation.  This limitation alone excludes the vast majority of homeowners. The nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation estimated in 2010 that this provision alone would make the new tax irrelevant to about 98 percent of families. It would only apply to those with the highest incomes.  Next, it isn’t a sales tax at all, because it applies only to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself.  Third, if the property you're selling is your primary residence -- and not a second home, vacation home or rental property -- you can turn a profit of $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) before the tax kicks in.  In addition, the tax is assessed only on the amount of profit that exceeds that limit. (The median sale price for a home in the U.S. was $164,500 in December, 2011, one big reason why the vast majority of Americans won't be affected by the tax.)  (Other property, such as that second home, would incur the tax, but, again, your basic income has to be high enough for you to be hit.)  The 3.8-percent tax is in addition to the existing capital gains tax that must be paid now. That rate is generally 15 percent.  So consider a couple who sells their home for $1 million after buying it many years ago for $100,000.  If they earn $249,000 that year, they will pay no new tax.  If they earn $251,000, they will be taxed. Although the profit on the home sale will be $900,000, the first $500,000 is not taxed. They will have to pay 3.8 percent on the remaining $400,000, in addition to the usual capital gains tax.  The National Association of Realtors (Realtor.org) has an 11-page booklet, The 3.8% Tax; Real Estate Scenarios & Examples, that outlines various scenarios and shows who will need to worry about the tax.  Our ruling  The chain e-mail claim that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax  is untrue on so many levels as to be ridiculous.  It's not a sales tax because it doesn't apply to the full sale price of the home, only the profit made in the sale.  It's not going to apply to the vast majority of Americans, only those whose income is more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples).  It's not going to apply to most people selling their home because they won't be getting $250,000 more than they paid for it ($500,000 for couples).  Because the e-mail wildly misrepresents one aspect of the new health care law, we rate it Pants on Fire.  (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

The tax falls on relatively few — those with high incomes from other sources.This should help stimulate the Real Estate market! UNDER THE NEW HEALTH CARE BILL – DID YOU KNOW THAT ALL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A 3.8% “SALES TAX”? YOU CAN THANK NANCY, HARRY & BARACK (AND YOUR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN) FOR THIS ONE. IF YOU SELL YOUR $400,000 HOME, THIS WILL BE A $15,200 TAX. Higher taxes on real estate investments. The 3.8% Medicare surtax would hit average, middle-class investors in real estate. A middle-class taxpayer who happens to sell real estate for a gain in a particular year would be liable for this new tax, regardless of how low her income might be in other, more typical years.We’ve been flooded with queries about this one ever since the health care bill became law. At the last minute, Democratic lawmakers decided on a new 3.8 percent tax on the net investment income of high-income persons. But the claim that this would amount to a $15,200 tax on the sale of a typical $400,000 home is utterly false.The truth is that only a tiny percentage of home sellers will pay the tax. First of all, only those with incomes over $200,000 a year ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) will be subject to it. And even for those who have such high incomes, the tax still won’t apply to the first $250,000 on profits from the sale of a personal residence — or to the first $500,000 in the case of a married couple selling their home.We can understand how this misconception got started. The law itself is couched in highly technical language that only a qualified tax expert can fully grasp. (This provision begins on page 33 of the reconciliation bill that was passed and signed into law.) And it does say the tax falls on net gain … attributable to the disposition of property. That would include the sale of a home. But the bill also says the tax falls only on that portion of any gain that is taken into account in computing taxable income under the existing tax code. And the fact is, the first $250,000 in profit on the sale of a primary residence (or $500,000 in the case of a married couple) is excluded from taxable income already. (That exclusion doesn’t apply to vacation homes or rental properties.)The Joint Committee on Taxation, the group of nonpartisan tax experts that Congress relies on to analyze tax proposals, underscores this in a footnote on page 135 of its report on the bill. The note states: Gross income does not include … excluded gain from the sale of a principal residence.And just to be sure, we checked with William Ahern, director of policy and communications for the nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation. Some home sales would see a tax increase under this bill, Ahern told us, but it would have to be a second home or a principal residence generating [a gain of] more than $250,000 ($500,000 for a couple).So there you have it. The sort of people who would have to pay the tax might include, for example:However, a typical home sale would not incur any tax. In March, for example, half of all existing homes sold for $170,700 or less, according to the National Association of Realtors. Obviously, none of those sales could possibly generate a $250,000 profit, and so none would be subject to the tax.Thus, for the vast majority, the 3.8 percent tax won’t apply. The Tax Foundation, in a report released April 15, said the new tax on investment income (including real estate) will hit approximately the top-earning two percent of families when it takes effect in 2013.Footnote: Some of the chain e-mails that claim ordinary home sales will be taxed include a copy of an article written by Paul Guppy, a policy analyst with the conservative Washington Policy Institute (that’s Washington state, not Washington, D.C.). The article appeared March 28 as an op-ed in the Spokane, Wash., Spokesman-Review, and Guppy claimed that [m]iddle-income people must pay the full tax even if they are ‘rich’ for only one day. That brought a quick rebuttal from Sara Orrange, the government affairs director of the local Realtors association. She wrote a letter to the newspaper calling Guppy’s article inaccurate and saying, Most people who sell their homes will not be impacted by these new regulations. This is not a new tax on every seller, and that correction needs to be made. In a news article the next day, business reporter Bert Caldwell confirmed that only a very few home sellers would pay the 3.8 percent tax.The Internal Revenue Service says that to qualify for the $250,000/$500,000 exclusion, a seller must have owned the home and lived there as the seller’s main home for at least two years out of the five years prior to the sale.Correction, Sept. 2: We originally said that the footnote of the JCT report appeared on page 139.

Among a number of major changes to the tax code in 2013, America’s top capital gains tax rate increased from 15 percent to 20 percent. On top of this, the healthcare law introduced a 3.8 percent net investment tax. Combined with state and local taxes on capital gains, the average top marginal tax rate in the United States increased to 27.9 percent from 19.1 percent.While this tax does hit the sale of your home a little harder, there are broader implications of this tax for the economy.It creates a bias against saving, reduces investment in the economy and thus results in slower economic growth and lower wages.Read more about capital gains taxes and their effects on the economy:The High Burden of State and Federal Capital Gains Taxes",https://taxfoundation.org/obamacare-s-tax-home-sales-nothing-new/,

It is wrong. It is urban myth. It is the revenue equivalent of death panels or the Halliburton conspiracy to start the Iraq war.This is one of those seemingly immortal Internet stories. You know the ones: They usually start with the assertion that, “They don’t want to know this but….” In the words of one blogger, “Obamacare will impose a 3.8 percent tax on all home sales and real estate transactions.”Umm, no it won’t. Yes, the health law will impose a 3.8 percent tax on investment profits and other non-wage income starting in 2013. But that tax applies only to couples with adjusted gross income of $250,000 (or individuals with AGI of $200,000). About 95 percent of households make less than that, and will be exempt from the law no matter what.In addition, couples who sell a personal residence can exclude the first $500,000 in profit from tax ($250,000 for singles). That would be profit from a home sale, not proceeds. So a couple that bought a house for $100,000 and sold it for $599,000 would owe no tax, even under the health law.If that couple had AGI in excess of $250,000 and made a profit of $500,010, it would owe the new tax. On ten bucks. That would be an extra 38 cents.The Tax Policy Center figures that in 2013 about 0.2 percent of households with cash income of $100,000-$200,000 would pay any additional tax under this provision. And they’d pay, on average, an extra $235. Keep in mind that is added tax on all sources of non-wage income, not just home sales.Still, like Dracula, this rumor can’t be killed. Politfact tried to knock it down in 2010. A couple of months ago, my Tax Policy Center colleague Donald Marron did the same in a Tax Notes article called “Health Reform’s Tax on Investment Income: Facts and Myths.”People who send Internet chain letters probably don’t read Tax Notes. Still, imagine Donald’s surprise when just last week he met a guy in Kansas City who insisted that the tax not only exists, but the rate is 7 percent (some sort of weird bracket-creep, I guess).Now imagine my surprise when, after I wrote a TaxVox article the other day about the (real) tax provisions of the health law, I got an email from a frustrated housing industry tax specialist. “There is usually some confusion/disinformation associated with new tax rules,” he wrote, “but I’ve never seen an issue that has as much as this one.”So the bottom line is this: If you are a married couple whose AGI exceeds $250,000, and if you make more than a $500,000 profit from the sale of your house, yes, you may owe this tax. But if you are anybody else, spend your time worrying about how you’re going to win the next $600 million lottery—or whether you are going to get bopped in the head by a stray asteroid on your way to work.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2012/04/02/there-is-no-obamacare-tax-on-most-home-sales-really/,

The first is any Property Tax that may be due. In many states, Property Tax is collected the year after it was due. Because of this, when you sell your home in one of these states, (Colorado for example) you have to pay the property tax that has been accrued up to and including the date of sale. Your closing company will calculate the pro-ration prior to close and inform you of the amount. In California, I believe you pay 1/2 of your taxes in advance, and 1/2 in arrears. So if your closing is in the first half of the year, you will see a credit for this amount, and if it is in the second half, you will owe the pro-rated amount.  I assume, however, that you were referring to Income Tax. Current (2012) Federal tax laws allow for a tax free gain on the Capital Gains of your home sale up to a certain amount. If you are married and have lived in your home for 2 of the last 5 years, you are able to sell your home with NO TAX on the first $500,000 in capital gain. If you are single, the amount is $250,000.  This DOES NOT mean that selling a $750,000 home means you pay tax on 250,000.   Capital gain means the sales price of your home, minus the purchase price, minus any expenses for home improvement over the time you owned it, minus the costs involved in selling the home. So in the case of our $750,000 home, if it was purchased for $250,000, there would still be no federal tax due. In the VAST majority of cases, this means that you will owe no tax on the sale of your home. Although admittedly, Beverly Hills may be different in this regard!  After the deduction, you would pay capital gains tax on the remaining profit at your own tax rate. That calculation is best left to an accountant.  In 2013, there is a new provision that if you incur the tax because your profit is over $500,000 AND your income is more than $200,000, you may be subject to capital gains PLUS an additional tax of 3.8%. It bears repeating that this only applies if your profit from the sale is more than $500,000 which will affect well under 1% of all home sales.

Middle-income people must pay the full tax even if they are “rich” for only one day — the day they sell their house and buy a new one. One of the provisions in the reconciliation bill ( passed in conjunction with the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA) health care legislation calls for high-income households to be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013:  The PPACA creates a new Code Section 1411, which will generally impose a tax on the lesser of “net investment income” or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over a “threshold amount” (generally, $250,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return, $125,000 for married taxpayers filing a separate return and $200,000 in all other cases). Net investment income generally means the excess of (i) interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rents, income from passive activities, income from trading financial instruments and commodities, and gain from the disposition of certain non-business property, over (ii) allowable deductions properly allocable to such income. In determining the amount of net investment income, special rules apply with respect to dispositions of equity interests in certain partnerships and and to distributions from certain qualified plans. This additional tax applies to taxable years beginning after 2012. This is a complicated section of a complicated piece of legislation, and the 3.8% Medicare tax has been frequently misreported as amounting to a 3.8% “sales tax” on all real estate transactions. This is incorrect: the Medicare tax is not a sales tax, nor does it apply to all real estate transactions; it is a tax on (income which may or not derive from the sale of property) only for persons who earn more than the amounts specified in the bill.First of all, the Medicare tax will be imposed on individuals with an income above $200,000 and couples with a joint income more than $250,000, a figure which currently excludes about 97% of all U.S. households. Second, the tax will not be assessed on every house sale, but only on real estate transactions that produce profits over a specified dollar amount. As Sara Orrange, Government affairs director of the Spokane Association of Realtors noted in response to a repetition of the “sales tax” rumor in the Spokane Spokesman-Review:  In his recent guest column regarding the impact of the health care bill, Paul Guppy of the Washington Policy Center claimed that a tax on all home sales was a part of the recently passed legislation. This is inaccurate and needs to be corrected. The truth about the bill is that if you sell your home for a profit above the capital gains threshold of $250,000 per individual or $500,000 per couple then you would be required to pay the additional tax on any gain realized over this threshold. In his recent guest column regarding the impact of the health care bill, Paul Guppy of the Washington Policy Center claimed that atax on all home sales was a part of the recently passed legislation. This is inaccurate and needs to be corrected. The truth about the bill is that if you sell your home for a profit above the capital gains threshold of $250,000 per individual or $500,000 per couple then you would be required to pay the additionaltax on any gain realized over this threshold. Most people who sell their homes will not be impacted by these new regulations. This is not a new tax on every seller, and that correction needs to be made. This tax is aimed at so-called “high you do not fall into that category you will not pay any extra taxes upon the sale of your home. For example, let’s assume that a couple with an income of $325,000 bought a house in 2004 for $300,000 and resold it in 2013 for $850,000, thus producing a $550,000 profit. Since U.S. law allows a couple to exclude from their gross income profits of up to $500,000 from the sale of their principal residence, the taxable gain from this sale would be $50,000 (i.e., a $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion), and the couple’s taxable income would now be $375,000 (i.e., the original $325,000 plus the $50,000 of taxable profit from their home sale). The 3.8% Medicare tax would now apply to whichever of the following dollar figures is the lesser:In case (a), the dollar figure would be the couple’s taxable income ($375,000) minus the income threshold level ($250,000), or $125,000.In case (b), the dollar figure would be amount of taxable income gained from the sale of their home, which, as detailed above, was $50,000 (i.e., $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion).The second dollar amount is the lesser of the two, and therefore the couple would have to pay an additional tax of of $50,000, which would amount to $1,900. (If the hypothetical couple had realized less than a $500,000 profit on the sale of their residence, none of that gain would be subject to the 3.8% tax.)The referenced tax is therefore not a tax on all real estate sales; it is an investment income tax which result in a very small percentage of home sellers paying additional taxes on home sales profits over a designated threshold amount. In short, if you’re a “high earner” and you sell your home at a substantial profit, you might be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax. However, given that only about 3% of U.S. households have incomes that exceed the specified income threshold amount, the existing home sale capital gains exclusion on a principal residence ($250,000 for individuals, $500,000 for couples) still stands, and the national median existing-home price in January 2012 was only $154,700 , the Medicare tax will likely affect only a very small percentage of home sellers when it is implemented in 2013.",https://www.snopes.com/politics/taxes/realestate.asp,

In fact, if you had simply lived in the home for two of the last five years, or through 2009 if you sold it in 2012, you still wouldn't owe any tax as long as your profit was less than $250,000 (if you're single) or $500,000 if you're married.Q: I recently sold a townhouse and was concerned about how much tax I would be responsible for paying. I sold it for $375,000. There was no mortgage on the property, and I hadn't lived in it since 2007. I had done a lot of improvements on it to increase its value for sale and had hopes of claiming it on my taxes for 2013. Is there some sort of estimated formula I could use to estimate how much I could expect to pay in taxes?However, that doesn't seem to be the case here. You didn't supply all of the information we need to assess your situation, but we can make some educated guesses about what has happened and point you in the right direction.Let's start with how profit and the cost basis are calculated. When you sell a home, the IRS wants to know not only how much you paid for the property, but what capital improvements you made to the property (adding a room or replacing the roof, as opposed to painting a bathroom), and how much it cost to sell. If you add up the costs of purchase, sale (including the commission) and capital improvements, you will get your cost basis. The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost basis from the total sales price.So if you sold your home for $375,000 and you paid $275,000 to purchase it plus another $25,000 to sell it (commission and other costs of sale), and $75,000 in capital improvements (let's say that included a new kitchen, new bathrooms, roof replacement and new mechanicals), you would have zero profit, because the costs of purchase, sale and capital improvements equal $375,000, which is the price you paid.Even though you didn't live in the home, you wouldn't owe any tax. Now, if the numbers don't line up that neatly, and you have $100,000 in profit, you would pay long-term capital gains tax at your current rate, which is probably 20 percent. So you would owe $20,000 in federal capital gains taxes and whatever extra in state tax.If you sold in 2013, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) topped $200,000 (if single) or $250,000 if married), you might owe an extra 3.8 percent on the $100,000, or $3,800, for the Medicare tax. (For FAQs on the extra Medicare tax, go to http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=258201,00.html.)If the house was a rental property (which you didn't indicate, although you said you hadn't lived there as a primary residence for five years), you may have taken depreciation. When you sell the property, unless you are doing a tax-free exchange for another investment property, you will owe recapture on the depreciation you have taken at a rate of 25 percent. So if you took $100,000 in depreciation, you might owe $25,000 in taxes on top of any profit.Whether you have a mortgage doesn't much matter when it comes to calculating your cost basis and any profit. What matters is whether you have, on a net basis, made money or lost money.For more details, you'll want to visit the IRS website and download these free publications: IRS Publication 523 Selling Your Home, Tax Topic 409 Capital Gains and Losses, and, if applicable, IRS Publication 527 Residential Rental Property.",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-19/classified/sns-201208101600--tms--realestmctnig-a20120819-20120819_1_long-term-capital-gains-tax-investment-property-capital-improvements,

Property and taxes go together like blood and leeches.Yet there's no reason to pay more than the minimum, and the Internal Revenue Code actually gives property owners lots of tax breaks.""For many homeowners, real estate taxes and mortgage interest are by far some of their biggest tax deductions,"" says Art Ford, a certified public accountant in Boston. ""If I pay $1,500 a month in mortgage interest, that's an $18,000-a-year deduction.""30 Yr.

Knowing these answers will help keep your tax bill as low as possible.No. 1: How much of my mortgage payment is tax deductible?On a Schedule A, you can generally deduct the following:Interest on debt used to buy, build or improve your primary or second home (called acquisition debt), as long as mortgages totaled $1 million or less ($500,000 if single or married filing separately)Mortgage insurance (or funding fees for government loans) for loans taken after 2006 as long as your adjusted gross income does not exceed $100,000 for a married couple (half that for singles and those married filing separately)Property taxes on first and second homes (if you itemize your deductions)No. 2: I sold my home this year. Will I owe capital gains tax?As long as the property was your principal residence for at least two of the last five years, you can exclude $250,000 of your profit ($500,000 for married couples) from your federal taxable income. If you profited less than the $250,000/$500,000 threshold, no extra form is required. You can do this as often as every two years.If you made a higher profit or otherwise don't qualify for the exclusion (say, you sold after just one year), Ford says you'll generally owe up to 23.8 percent in federal taxes on your gains over and above the ""excluded"" amount. (Your actual rate will vary depending on your income.)But when calculating your taxable gains, Ford suggests looking beyond what you originally paid for your home. You should also factor in anything that you spent on home improvements while you owned the property.Say you and your spouse bought a place for $100,000 two decades ago, lived there as your primary residence and sold the home for $800,000. You'd ordinarily have to pay capital-gains taxes on $200,000 -- your $800,000 sale price minus your $100,000 purchase price minus the $500,000 exclusion for married couples.However, if you spent $150,000 on upgrades, you can deduct that from your capital gain. In the example above, that would reduce your taxable profit from $200,000 to just $50,000.That said, IRS Publication 523 notes that you generally can't deduct repairs or maintenance, only ""improvements"" that are designed to increase your home's value. Unfortunately, the rules for what's a ""repair"" versus an ""improvement"" are pretty vague.For instance, the IRS says fixing a broken windowpane is a repair, but replacing it as part of a project to swap out all of your home's windows is an improvement. So, consult with a tax professional or read IRS Publication 523 for further guidance.If you still have taxable profits on your home after factoring in all of the above, you'll report your gains on a Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses. There are special rules for vacation homes. You may be able to exclude some or all of your gain.Remember, different states have different rules. Always consult with a tax professional if you need personal advice.No. 3: I lost money on the sale of my home. Do I get to deduct the loss?Loss on the sale of a personal residence is treated like a loss on the sale of any personal property. It is not deductible. Losses on investment properties are deductible.No. 4: Are my closing costs tax deductible?You can claim a deduction for real estate taxes you paid as part of your mortgage closing costs. The same goes for prepaid interest. It will be included on the 1098 form your lender sends you.What about points?The IRS has a flowchart that you can use to see if points are fully deductible. In general, you must have paid points to build, buy or improve your primary residence in order to deduct the entire amount in the year they were paid. Otherwise, they may still be deducted but on a prorated basis.No. 5: What happens with points on a refinance?This deduction is often overlooked, and it could be worth a lot. When you pay points on a refinance, they have to be prorated.For example, if you paid $3,000 in points on a 30-year mortgage, you can deduct $100 a year for 30 years. But if you refinanced again this year and have prorated points that have not yet been deducted -- for example, you are 10 years into a 30-year loan and have only deducted $1,000 of $3,000 in points paid -- you can deduct the remaining $2,000 in the year you refinance.No. 6: Does a mortgage modification affect my taxes?If you modify your mortgage, one consequence might be that you pay so much less interest that you will save more by choosing the standard deduction rather than itemizing. Don't just assume that itemizing is always best because you did it in the past.No. 7: Does a foreclosure, short sale or principal reduction affect my taxes?Homeowners who lost their homes to either a foreclosure, short sale or had a bank ""forgive"" part of their mortgage principal (this could have occurred during a loan modification) used to have to pay income taxes on any money that their lender agreed to write off.But the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 and subsequent extensions changed that for loans restructured between 2007 and 2016 for primary residences. For those tax years, you don't have to consider the discharge of mortgage debt as taxable income.However, the 2007 law doesn't cover investment properties and vacation homes, nor does it apply to forgiven home equity loans.Lastly, some jurisdictions require filers to pay state income taxes on forgiven mortgage debt, so check with a tax professional about your personal situation.No. 8: Can I deduct prepayment penalties?Prepayment penalties paid on a mortgage are tax deductible in the year that they are paid.No. 9: What expenses am I NOT allowed to deduct from my income?Unless your property is a rental or investment, you don't get tax breaks for the following:Hazard insuranceHomeowners association duesPrincipal paymentsGeneral closing costs like appraisal fees or title insuranceLocal assessments to improve your neighborhoodNo. 10: Does the so-called ""Obamacare"" tax affect gains from property sales?The 2010 ""Obamacare"" Affordable Care Act added an extra 3.8 percent tax on capital gains incurred by certain high-income taxpayers.If you fall under the law's requirements, you'll have to pay 23.8 percent in federal income taxes on your home-sale profits over and above the $250,000/$500,000 exclusion rather than the 20 percent rate that you'd otherwise face.However, this extra tax only applies to single or head-of-household filers who have a $200,000 adjusted gross income or married joint filers with a $250,000 adjusted gross income. And remember, the first $250,000 of a single taxpayer's profits ($500,000 for joint filers) is federally tax free.No. 11: How does the U.S. Supreme Court's gay-marriage ruling affect same-sex couples?The Supreme Court's June 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage in all 50 states doesn't affect same-sex couples' federal income taxes because the IRS has recognized legal gay marriages for tax purposes since 2013.An earlier Supreme Court ruling that partly invalidated 1996's Defense of Marriage Act prompted the tax agency to decide that same-sex couples married in any U.S. or foreign jurisdiction that recognized gay marriage could file tax returns jointly. The rule applied even if gay couples later moved to states that didn't allow gay marriage.However, last summer's landmark high-court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide means gay couples in states that previously banned the practice should have the right to file state or local income-tax returns jointly for 2015 for the first time.No. 12: Does my income affect my tax deductions?The IRS has increased the maximum adjusted gross income that filers can have for 2015 and still fully itemize deductions -- good news for wealthy homeowners who want to claim things like the mortgage-interest tax break.Married joint filers can have $309,900 AGIs and still itemize all deductions, up from $305,050 in 2014. Singles can make an adjusted $258,250 versus $254,200 previously, while married couples filing separately can have $154,950 AGIs, up from $152,525 in 2014. Above those limits, IRS rules begin to phase out what percentage of expenses you can deduct.Conversely, the IRS has also boosted standard deductions for 2015. Married joint filers who don't itemize can claim a standard $12,600 versus $12,400 in 2014, while singles and married people filing separately can $6,300 instead of $6,200 a year earlier. (Heads of household can receive $9,250, up from $9,100 in 2014.)Smart homeowners will do the math to see which works out better for them -- itemizing or taking the standard deduction.Lisa Greene-Lewis, an accountant with TurboTax, says many homeowners will do better by itemizing instead of simply claiming the standard deduction. ""The mortgage-interest deduction is one of the biggest itemized deductions for many people for sure,"" she says. ""That's usually the one that puts homeowners over the threshold to where itemizing makes sense.""Knowing what tax deductions are available to you can help minimize the tax man's bite come April 18.

However, while this Medicare tax will be applied to households with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 or more for individuals, or $250,000 or more for married couples, it typically won’t include capital gains resulting from the sale of a home, providing that home is a primary residence and not a vacation or rental home.",Is There Really A New Tax On Home Sales? | .com,"Dear Real Estate Adviser, When selling my house, I understand there is now a 3 percent federal tax imposed on the sale to help pay for the Obama medical plan. Is this applicable to all sales?— R. FedorDear R. Fedor, You’ve glommed onto some wrong information, I’m afraid. While the volume of erroneous emails, op-ed pieces and other communications penned following the March 2010 passage of the controversial Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has waned somewhat, the misinformation apparently lingers on. The National Association of Realtors received so many inquiries on the topic that it posted a myth-buster document on Realtors.org to refute it.Now, there is one provision of the act that has been a source of confusion. Starting in 2013, the health care bill does impose a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers who exceed a total household net-investment income — a total which could conceivably include some of the proceeds from a home sale. However, while this Medicare tax will be applied to households with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 or more for individuals, or $250,000 or more for married couples, it typically won’t include capital gains resulting from the sale of a home, providing that home is a primary residence and not a vacation or rental home.Why? Because the capital gains tax exclusion rule for sales of a primary home — $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples — will remain. In other words, if the profit realized from the sale of the home falls below those capital gains exclusion totals, then it can’t be tacked on to that household’s net-investment income tally. Hence, that 3.8 percent Medicare tax would not apply.If the gains from the sale of the house do exceed the $250,000 or $500,000 thresholds, they will be added to the household’s net-income total, which is subject to that 3.8 percent Medicare tax. All told, however, that tax will fall on a relative few — typically, households with large incomes from other sources. Any revenue collected through the Medicare tax, by the way, goes to the Medicare hospital insurance program.If you do happen to be in that high-income bracket and own one of those scant few homes in which your sale profits are likely to greatly exceed the capital gains limits, you won’t have to worry about that Medicare tax anyway unless you wait until next year or later to sell. Even if you should decide to sell in 2013 or after, the issue may be moot by then if the Supreme Court shoots down parts or all of the legislation this year.Most likely though, that Medicare tax will not affect you in any way.

If next year it is more than $200,000 and you’re a single taxpayer or more than $250,000 if you’re married and file a joint return, then the 3.8 percent tax might apply. But if it is less than the threshold for your filing status, then that’s that. The new investment tax will not affect you.",Home-sale tax rumor persists,"Despite being declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, the health care reform law continues to come under attack.The latest assault on Obamacare, as it’s popularly known, came Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention. Newly minted vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan took the opportunity in his nationally televised speech to excoriate the president’s signature piece of legislation.But perhaps more damaging to the public perception of health care reform than any political rhetoric is an online tax rumor that just won’t die. Maybe you’ve gotten the email that warns:This message isn’t trying to scam you out of any money, just your vote (which could cost you money, but that’s for another blog post). The email does, however, use the age-old con artist trick of taking a fact and then distorting it to the sender’s advantage.In this case, the kernel of truth is that there is indeed a 3.8 percent tax that will take effect in 2013. It’s an added Medicare levy that will be assessed on the investment income, which could include some real estate sales, of higher-income taxpayers.And it was created as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (that’s the official name of Obamacare).But the tax doesn’t apply automatically to everyone’s investment earnings and certainly not to all homeowners who make a profit on the sale of their homes.There are two things to consider in determining whether you might owe this new tax next year.First, look at your adjusted gross income. If next year it is more than $200,000 and you’re a single taxpayer or more than $250,000 if you’re married and file a joint return, then the 3.8 percent tax might apply. But if it is less than the threshold for your filing status, then that’s that. The new investment tax will not affect you.But let’s say you are a high-earner under this tax’s guidelines. In that case you must calculate your profit from the sale of your home.If you’re a single filer, you can net up to $250,000 on the sale of your principal residence and not owe any capital gains taxes on the income. The amount of profit excluded from tax for a married, jointly filing couple is double that.  If your home-sale profit falls within the exclusion limits for your filing status, the 3.8 percent tax won’t apply because you won’t have any investment income from your home sale to report.However, if you are subject to the tax and your net home sale profit is larger than the exclusion amount, then you might owe the 3.8 percent Medicare tax. But only on the part of the home-sale gain over the applicable exclusion limit, not the entire sale proceeds.That means that most people will not face the health care tax.Remember, too, that you reduce any capital gains by selling assets that have lost value and using those losses to offset your taxable investment earnings.Second-home owners, however, watch out. If you sell your vacation home, that profit could be subject to the Medicare tax.Want the latest tax news, tax alerts and tax-saving tips?

If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/01/3-8-percent-sales-tax-real-estate-health-care/,False,False,False,True,False,False,Individuals will owe the tax if they have Net Investment Income and also have modified adjusted gross income over the following thresholds.,Net Investment Income Tax FAQs | Internal Revenue Service,"Basics of the Net Investment Income Tax 1. What is the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)?The Net Investment Income Tax is imposed by section 1411 of the Internal Revenue Code. The NIIT applies at a rate of 3.8% to certain net investment income of individuals, estates and trusts that have income above the statutory threshold amounts.2. When did the Net Investment Income Tax take effect?The Net Investment Income Tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 2013. The NIIT affects income tax returns of individuals, estates and trusts, beginning with their first tax year beginning on (or after) Jan. 1, 2013. It does not affect income tax returns for the 2012 taxable year filed in 2013.Who Owes the Net Investment Income Tax 3. What individuals are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?Individuals will owe the tax if they have Net Investment Income and also have modified adjusted gross income over the following thresholds:Filing StatusThreshold AmountMarried filing jointly $250,000Married filing separately $125,000Single $200,000Head of household (with qualifying person) $200,000Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child $250,000Taxpayers should be aware that these threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation.If you are an individual who is exempt from Medicare taxes, you still may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax if you have Net Investment Income and also have modified adjusted gross income over the applicable thresholds.4. What is modified adjusted gross income for purposes of the Net Investment Income Tax?For the Net Investment Income Tax, modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income (Form 1040, Line 37) increased by the difference between amounts excluded from gross income under section 911(a)(1) and the amount of any deductions (taken into account in computing adjusted gross income) or exclusions disallowed under section 911(d)(6) for amounts described in section 911(a)(1). In the case of taxpayers with income from controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and passive foreign investment companies (PFICs), they may have additional adjustments to their AGI. See section 1.1411-10(e) of the final regulations. 5. What individuals are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?Nonresident Aliens (NRAs) are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax. If an NRA is married to a U.S. citizen or resident and has made, or is planning to make, an election under section 6013(g) or 6013(h) to be treated as a resident alien for purposes of filing as Married Filing Jointly, the final regulations provide these couples special rules and a corresponding section 6013(g)/(h) election for the NIIT. A dual-resident individual, within the meaning of regulation §301.7701(b)-7(a)(1), who determines that he or she is a resident of a foreign country for tax purposes pursuant to an income tax treaty between the United States and that foreign country and claims benefits of the treaty as a nonresident of the United States is considered a NRA for purposes of the NIIT.A dual-status individual, who is a resident of the United States for part of the year and a NRA for the other part of the year, is subject to the NIIT only with respect to the portion of the year during which the individual is a United States resident. The threshold amount (described in # 3 above) is not reduced or prorated for a dual-status resident. 6. What estates and trusts are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?Estates and trusts are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax if they have undistributed Net Investment Income and also have adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket for an estate or trust begins for such taxable year under section 1(e) (for tax year 2013, this threshold amount is $11,950). Generally, the threshold amount for the upcoming year is updated by IRS each fall in a revenue procedure. For 2014, the threshold amount is $12,150 (See Rev. Proc. 2013-35). There are special computational rules for certain unique types of trusts, such as Qualified Funeral Trusts, Charitable Remainder Trusts and Electing Small Business Trusts, which can be found in the final regulations (see # 20 below).7. What estates and trusts are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?The following trusts are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax:Trusts that are exempt from income taxes imposed by Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., charitable trusts and qualified retirement plan trusts exempt from tax under section 501, and Charitable Remainder Trusts exempt from tax under section 664).A trust or decedent’s estate in which all of the unexpired interests are devoted to one or more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B).Trusts that are classified as “grantor trusts” under sections 671-679.Trusts that are not classified as “trusts” for federal income tax purposes (e.g., Real Estate Investment Trusts and Common Trust Funds).Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts.Perpetual Care (Cemetery) Trusts. What is Included in Net Investment Income 8. What is included in Net Investment Income?In general, investment income includes, but is not limited to: interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income, non-qualified annuities, income from businesses involved in trading of financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are passive activities to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 469). To calculate your Net Investment Income, your investment income is reduced by certain expenses properly allocable to the income (see #13 below).9. What are some common types of income that are not Net Investment Income?Wages, unemployment compensation; operating income from a nonpassive business, Social Security Benefits, alimony, tax-exempt interest, self-employment income, Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends (see Rev. Rul. 90-56, 1990-2 CB 102) and distributions from certain Qualified Plans (those described in sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A or 457(b)).10. What kinds of gains are included in Net Investment Income?To the extent that gains are not otherwise offset by capital losses, the following gains are common examples of items taken into account in computing Net Investment Income:Gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.Capital gain distributions from mutual funds.Gain from the sale of investment real estate (including gain from the sale of a second home that is not a primary residence).Gains from the sale of interests in partnerships and S corporations (to the extent the partner or shareholder was a passive owner). See section 1.1411-7 of the 2013 proposed regulations.11. Does this tax apply to gain on the sale of a personal residence?The Net Investment Income Tax does not apply to any amount of gain that is excluded from gross income for regular income tax purposes. The pre-existing statutory exclusion in section 121 exempts the first $250,000 ($500,000 in the case of a married couple) of gain recognized on the sale of a principal residence from gross income for regular income tax purposes and, thus, from the NIIT.Example 1: A, a single filer, earns $210,000 in wages and sells his principal residence that he has owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $420,000. A’s cost basis in the home is $200,000. A’s realized gain on the sale is $220,000. Under section 121, A may exclude up to $250,000 of gain on the sale. Because this gain is excluded for regular income tax purposes, it is also excluded for purposes of determining Net Investment Income. In this example, the Net Investment Income Tax does not apply to the gain from the sale of A’s home.Example 2: B and C, a married couple filing jointly, sell their principal residence that they have owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $1.3 million. B and C’s cost basis in the home is $700,000. B and C’s realized gain on the sale is $600,000. The recognized gain subject to regular income taxes is $100,000 ($600,000 realized gain less the $500,000 section 121 exclusion). B and C have $125,000 of other Net Investment Income, which brings B and C’s total Net Investment Income to $225,000. B and C’s modified adjusted gross income is $300,000 and exceeds the threshold amount of $250,000 by $50,000. B and C are subject to NIIT on the lesser of $225,000 (B’s Net Investment Income) or $50,000 (the amount B and C’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the $250,000 married filing jointly threshold). B and C owe Net Investment Income Tax of $1,900 ($50,000 X 3.8%).Example 3: D, a single filer, earns $45,000 in wages and sells her principal residence that she has owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $1 million. D’s cost basis in the home is $600,000. D’s realized gain on the sale is $400,000. The recognized gain subject to regular income taxes is $150,000 ($400,000 realized gain less the $250,000 section 121 exclusion), which is also Net Investment Income. D’s modified adjusted gross income is $195,000. Since D’s modified adjusted gross income is below the threshold amount of $200,000, D does not owe any Net Investment Income Tax.12. Does Net Investment Income include interest, dividends and capital gains of my children that I report on my Form 1040 using Form 8814?The amounts of Net Investment Income that are included on your Form 1040 by reason of Form 8814 are included in calculating your Net Investment Income. However, the calculation of your Net Investment Income does not include (a) amounts excluded from your Form 1040 due to the threshold amounts on Form 8814 and (b) amounts attributable to Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends.13. What investment expenses are deductible in computing NII?In order to arrive at Net Investment Income, Gross Investment Income (items described in items 7-11 above) is reduced by deductions that are properly allocable to items of Gross Investment Income. Examples of deductions, a portion of which may be properly allocable to Gross Investment Income, include investment interest expense, investment advisory and brokerage fees, expenses related to rental and royalty income, tax preparation fees, fiduciary expenses (in the case of an estate or trust) and state and local income taxes.14. Will I have to pay both the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax and the additional .9% Medicare tax?You may be subject to both taxes, but not on the same type of income.The 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax applies to individuals’ wages, compensation and self-employment income over certain thresholds, but it does not apply to income items included in Net Investment Income. See more information on the Additional Medicare Tax.How the Net Investment Income Tax is Reported and Paid 15. If I am subject to the Net Investment Income Tax, how will I report and pay the tax?Individuals, estates, and trusts will use Form 8960 and instructions to compute their Net Investment Income Tax. For individuals, the tax will be reported on, and paid with, the Form 1040. For estates and trusts, the tax will be reported on, and paid with, the Form 1041.16. Is the Net Investment Income Tax subject to the estimated tax provisions?The Net Investment Income Tax is subject to the estimated tax provisions. Individuals, estates and trusts that expect to be subject to the tax in 2013 or thereafter should adjust their income tax withholding or estimated payments to account for the tax increase in order to avoid underpayment penalties. For more information on tax withholding and estimated tax, see Publication 505, Tax withholding and Estimated Tax.17. Can tax credits reduce my NIIT liability?Any federal income tax credit that may be used to offset a tax liability imposed by subtitle A of the Code may be used to offset the NII. However, if the tax credit is allowed only against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (regular income tax), those credits may not reduce the NIIT. For example, foreign income tax credits (sections 27(a) and 901(a)) and the general business credit (section 38) are allowed as credits only against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, and therefore may not be used to reduce your NIIT liability. If you take foreign income taxes as an income tax deduction (versus a tax credit), some (or all) of the deduction amount may deducted against NII.  18. Does the tax have to be withheld from wages?No, but you may request that additional income tax be withheld from your wages.Examples of the Calculation of the Net Investment Income Tax 19. Single taxpayer with income less than the statutory threshold.Taxpayer, a single filer, has wages of $180,000 and $15,000 of dividends and capital gains. Taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income is $195,000, which is less than the $200,000 statutory threshold. Taxpayer is not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax.20. Single taxpayer with income greater than the statutory threshold.Taxpayer, a single filer, has $180,000 of wages. Taxpayer also received $90,000 from a passive partnership interest, which is considered Net Investment Income. Taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income is $270,000.Taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold of $200,000 for single taxpayers by $70,000. Taxpayer’s Net Investment Income is $90,000.The Net Investment Income Tax is based on the lesser of $70,000 (the amount that Taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000 threshold) or $90,000 (Taxpayer’s Net Investment Income). Taxpayer owes NIIT of $2,660 ($70,000 x 3.8%).Additional Information 21. Other than these FAQs, is there additional information available about the Net Investment Income Tax?Yes. You can find additional information about the NIIT in the 2013 final regulations and in a new 2013 proposed regulation published on Dec. 2, 2013.22. The proposed regulations that were published on Dec. 5, 2012, are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, but the Net Investment Income Tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 2013. May I rely on those proposed regulations, the proposed regulations published on Dec. 2, 2013, and/or the final regulations, also published on Dec. 2, 2013, for guidance on the Net Investment Income Tax during 2013?Yes. For taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 (e.g., calendar year 2013), taxpayers may rely on the 2012 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 5, 2012), the 2013 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013), or the 2013 final regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013) for purposes of completing Form 8960. However, to the extent that taxpayers take a position in a taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 that is inconsistent with the final regulations, and such position affects the treatment of one or more items in a taxable year beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, then such taxpayer must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that their Net Investment Income Tax liability in the taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013 is not inappropriately distorted. For example, reasonable adjustments may be required to ensure that no item of income or deduction is taken into account in computing net investment income more than once, and that carryforwards, basis adjustments and other similar items are adjusted appropriately.",https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/net-investment-income-tax-faqs,
If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/01/3-8-percent-sales-tax-real-estate-health-care/,False,False,False,True,False,False,"On January 1 of 2013, the new tax requirements of the PPACA go into effect. If your modified adjusted gross income is over $200,000 if you are single or $250,000 if you are married and file jointly, you will need to pay an additional Medicare transaction tax of 3.8 percent on any investment income that brings you over the threshold.",What Will Happen to My Taxes If I Sell a Rental House?,"Rental houses can be excellent sources of ongoing tax-advantaged profits. However, they also have a key drawback: If you sell them for more than their depreciated value, you could have to pay significant taxes. The IRS levies tax on capital gains, which are profits above the selling price and on recaptured depreciation: any sales proceeds between the original purchase price and the depreciated value. For large profits, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, may also add additional tax liability.As long as you have held your rental property for at least one year, any gain that you make on its sale will be taxed as long-term capital gains at a rate of 15 percent. To calculate your capital gains tax, subtract your basis, which is your purchase price plus any closing fees plus any capital improvements, from your net selling price, which is the sales price less any commissions or closing charges. That amount of money is subject to the capital gains tax.The IRS also makes you pay back your depreciation in the form of Section 1250 depreciation recapture taxes. If you sold your property for more than the depreciated value, simply add up all of the depreciation you claimed over the period of your ownership, and pay 25 percent of it as tax. Even if you did not claim depreciation, you will still need to pay recapture tax as if you did. The IRS charges recapture tax whether or not you actually claimed the depreciation to which you were entitled.If you live in a state like California that has an income tax, you may also owe state income tax on your capital gain and depreciation recapture. California, for example, taxes both capital gains and recapture as regular income. In the 2012 tax year, a married couple's taxable income over $97,884 gets taxed at a 9.3 percent rate, with incomes over $1,000,000 being subject to an additional 1 percent tax for a total rate of 10.3 percent.On January 1 of 2013, the new tax requirements of the PPACA go into effect. If your modified adjusted gross income is over $200,000 if you are single or $250,000 if you are married and file jointly, you will need to pay an additional Medicare transaction tax of 3.8 percent on any investment income that brings you over the threshold. For example, if you are married and earn $110,000 from your jobs and make $260,000 in capital gains and recaptured depreciation on the sale of your house, you would need to pay the 3.8 percent tax on the $120,000 of investment income over the $250,000 threshold.You can defer paying all of these taxes. If you plan to use the proceeds of from the sale of your rental house to buy more investment real estate property, you can structure the transaction as a 1031 exchange. In these transactions, you have to follow a stringent set of IRS regulations, but end up carrying your basis forward into your new property and don't end up realizing any gain. Since you do not realize a gain, you do not have to pay any of the above taxes.",http://homeguides.sfgate.com/happen-taxes-sell-rental-house-45336.html,
If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/01/3-8-percent-sales-tax-real-estate-health-care/,False,False,False,Can not judge,False,False,"If you sell in 2013, your tax bill will rise. If capital gains taxes go up to 20 percent, you would pay about $60,000 in capital gains tax. But you would also be subject to the new Medicare tax of 3.8 percent on any income above $200,000 as a single person. That would add another $3,800 of tax (for the first $100,000), and you’d pay that extra 3.8 percent on any amount of income over the limit.",Lowering Your Capital Gains Tax: Home Improvements,"Making home improvements can lower your capital gains tax, but that may change in 2013.Q: In 1975, my parents built a four bedroom house on Cape Cod and they put my name on the deed with theirs. My parents died quite some time ago, so I have had the house since then.For most of those years, I lived in Syracuse and would stay at the house each summer for a short visit. I’ve lived in Sarasota, Florida now for almost 20 years. My husband passed away about a year ago, and I’m wondering what I should do about the house.The home is in a real estate trust and our surviving five children will inherit it. But, I’m considering selling it. I am afraid my capital gains tax will be astronomical because the home cost around $50,000 when they bought it and now it’s worth about $500,000! We have made many improvements to the home over the years including a new roof, back, furnace, gutters, just to name a few.My children are not well off and none could afford to buy out the others. Any ideas on what I should do?A: We’re sorry for your loss last year. It’s clear that over the years, you have quite a bit of money invested into the Cape Cod home. While you might think that you’d have to pay taxes on the difference between the purchase price of the home and what the home is now worth, that’s not exactly how it works.If you sold your home today, you would have costs related to selling the home. You also have considerable capital improvements that you’ve made to the home over the years. These would all push up the cost basis of the home and ultimately reduce your taxes.Here’s how it might work. Let’s assume that you put about $100,000 in capital improvements over the years and you have about $50,000 in expenses when you sell the home. If you sold today, you’d have to pay tax on the difference between the sales price of the home, less the costs of sale and capital improvements, then subtracting what you paid for the home and any costs associated with the purchase (if you can remember them).In this example, we’d say that your profit on the sale would be about $300,000 rather than $450,000. That’s quite a nice sum of money, particularly if you don’t have to pay off a lender when you sell the home.If you were to sell before the end of 2012 and used today’s maximum capital gains rate of 15 percent, you’d end up paying about $45,000 in federal income taxes.If you sell in 2013, your tax bill will rise. If capital gains taxes go up to 20 percent, you would pay about $60,000 in capital gains tax. But you would also be subject to the new Medicare tax of 3.8 percent on any income above $200,000 as a single person. That would add another $3,800 of tax (for the first $100,000), and you’d pay that extra 3.8 percent on any amount of income over the limit. So if your income for the year was $400,000, you’d pay an extra 3.8 percent Medicare tax on $200,000, or $7,600.But even with that extra tax, you’d only pay a total of $63,800 in tax on roughly $475,000 in cash (after paying a 5 percent commission). You’d walk away with $411,200. That’s a nice chunk of change and you could then make cash gifts to your children of $13,000 each tax free to give them a helping hand now, rather than letting them inherit all of it. Then you get to enjoy helping make their lives easier.There’s a secondary benefit to cashing out now and giving away the money and that is we don’t know what is going to happen to the inheritance tax. If it falls to $1 million, your estate might wind up giving up a chunk to federal estate tax, which would be unfortunate.Let’s think about what happens if you don’t sell. You and your family could continue to use it and at some point, when they become owners of the home, they could sell the home. If this is your only asset or your whole estate is not that large and less than $1 million at the time of your death, you won’t have to worry about you, your estate or your kids having to pay any estate taxes. If the estate tax laws roll back in time, you’ll still have the ability to exclude from federal estate taxes up to one million dollars. If the estate laws change and they come up with a higher number for you, it may not impact you anyway if your estate will be less than $1 million when you die.One aspect of estate law that’s yet to be determined is whether the “stepped-up” basis rule stays or goes. If the stepped-up basis rules exists in the year you die, your kids will inherit the property based on the value of the Cape Cod home at the time of your death. If this rule exists at that time, your estate wouldn’t have any federal estate taxes to pay and your kids could sell the home and they wouldn’t have any federal income taxes to pay. They wouldn’t even have any capital gains taxes to pay.But if the stepped-up basis rule goes away, when your kids sell the home after your death, they would pay taxes when they sold the home.With so much up in the air, and so much cash at stake, you should hire an estate planner or accountant to review your whole estate and see if you are better off doing something now or later and minimizing the impact that estate taxes, capital gains taxes and other taxes may have on you and your family in the years to come.",http://www.thinkglink.com/2012/12/28/lowering-capital-gains-tax-home-improvements/,
If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/01/3-8-percent-sales-tax-real-estate-health-care/,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Starting in 2013, the health-care-reform law adds a 3.8% Medicare surtax to unearned income -- including interest, dividends, capital gains (potentially including profits from the sale of a home), rents and royalties. This tax applies only to people with modified adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000 if they’re single, or $250,000 if married filing jointly.",New Tax on Windfall Home-Sale Profits,"A surtax created by the health-reform law will apply only to high-income individuals who sell their homes after 2012 for a large profit.I’ve heard that everyone who sells their house will now have to pay a 3.8% tax on the proceeds from the sale because of the new health-care law. Is this true?No, although it’s possible that an extra tax will fall on a limited amount of home-sale profit realized by some high-income individuals. Here’s the deal:Starting in 2013, the health-care-reform law adds a 3.8% Medicare surtax to unearned income -- including interest, dividends, capital gains (potentially including profits from the sale of a home), rents and royalties. This tax applies only to people with modified adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000 if they’re single, or $250,000 if married filing jointly. The surtax applies to investment income or the amount of modified adjusted gross income above $250,000, whichever is less.Another rule will further protect home-sale profits from the tax. When you sell your home, up to $250,000 of the profit is tax-free if you’re single and have owned and lived in the home for at least two of the five years leading up to the sale. The tax-free amount is a cool half-million dollars if you’re married and file a joint return. Any profit that dodges an income-tax bill thanks to this rule avoids the new 3.8% tax, too. So a married couple who bought a home more than two years ago for $300,000 can sell it for up to $800,000 without having to pay taxes on the sale -- no matter how high their income is. (The exclusion does not apply to vacation homes.)If they were to sell the home for $900,000 in 2013, however, the $100,000 profit above the tax-free amount would be hit by the 15% capital-gains tax and might be subject to the Medicare surtax, too. It would kick in if the couple’s income (including that $100,000 of taxable profit) exceeded $250,000. If the couple had a modified AGI of $260,000, for example, they’d have to pay the 3.8% tax on $10,000. With an income of $500,000, they’d owe the 3.8% tax on the full $100,000.If your income puts you in the crosshairs for this upcoming tax hike -- and you anticipate a home-sale profit that exceeds the tax-free amount -- selling before 2013 would let you avoid the tax, notes William Massey, senior tax analyst with Thomson Reuters.For more information, see Your Tax Bill for the Health Bill.

This is from FactCheck.org:At the last minute, Democratic lawmakers decided on a new 3.8 percent tax on the net investment income of high-income persons. But the claim that this would amount to a $15,200 tax on the sale of a typical $400,000 home is utterly false.The truth is that only a tiny percentage of home sellers will pay the tax. First of all, only those with incomes over $200,000 a year ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) will be subject to it. And even for those who have such high incomes, the tax still won’t apply to the first $250,000 on profits from the sale of a personal residence — or to the first $500,000 in the case of a married couple selling their home.We can understand how this misconception got started. The law itself is couched in highly technical language that only a qualified tax expert can fully grasp. (This provision begins on page 33 of the reconciliation bill that was passed and signed into law.) And it does say the tax falls on “net gain … attributable to the disposition of property.” That would include the sale of a home. But the bill also says the tax falls only on that portion of any gain that is “taken into account in computing taxable income” under the existing tax code. And the fact is, the first $250,000 in profit on the sale of a primary residence (or $500,000 in the case of a married couple) is excluded from taxable income already. (That exclusion doesn’t apply to vacation homes or rental properties.)The Joint Committee on Taxation, the group of nonpartisan tax experts that Congress relies on to analyze tax proposals, underscores this in a footnote on page 135 of its report on the bill. The note states: “Gross income does not include … excluded gain from the sale of a principal residence.”And just to be sure, we checked with William Ahern, director of policy and communications for the nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation. “Some home sales would see a tax increase under this bill,” Ahern told us, “but it would have to be a second home or a principal residence generating [a gain of] more than $250,000 ($500,000 for a couple).”So there you have it. The sort of people who would have to pay the tax might include, for example:However, a typical home sale would not incur any tax. In March, for example, half of all existing homes sold for $170,700 or less, according to the National Association of Realtors. Obviously, none of those sales could possibly generate a $250,000 profit, and so none would be subject to the tax.Thus, for the vast majority, the 3.8 percent tax won’t apply. The Tax Foundation, in a report released April 15, said the new tax on investment income (including real estate) “will hit approximately the top-earning 2% of families” when it takes effect in 2013.",https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2010/09/22/obamacares-3-8-real-estate-sales-tax/,

One need not agree with everything in it to conclude that someone did die, an eye was lost, detainees were made to stand on broken limbs and deprived of sleep for 180 hours. It’s as if King didn’t read the report before he went on the radio.","Peter King says Senate CIA report found detainees were not killed, did not suffer 'lasting injuries'","Rep. Peter King brushed off a new Senate report on the CIA interrogation program as a partisan, one-sided account.Nothing to see here, people. Move along.During a Dec. 9 appearance on , King, a New York Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism, said that the CIA tactics were rough, they were tough, but they were not torture. He went on to downplay the report’s findings.This is not a case where people were killed, he said.We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that, he added. We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. But again, nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this.The Senate Intelligence Committee began investigating the scope of the CIA Enhanced Interrogation Program in 2009. On Dec. 9, committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., released the executive summary of the committee’s review of the program, which began in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. It alleges the program was not effective in gathering intelligence, CIA officials lied to Congress and the president about its effectiveness, the program was poorly managed, and the tactics were more brutal than people were told.Those conclusions are contested by many CIA officials and some , who wrote a . However, many details uncovered by the report, on which King was commenting, don’t appear to be disputed and are based on 6.3 million pages of documents and CIA cables reviewed by Senate staff.Even an ancillary reading of the Senate report’s executive summary — a 600-page document that is only one-tenth of the still-classified full study — finds King’s comments to be dubious.King’s staff did not respond to requests for comment.Not a case where people were killedLet’s put to bed one false claim King made off the bat: that no one was killed.In fact, someone did die as a result of the interrogation program.In 2002, the CIA interrogated Gul Rahman at Cobalt, an overseas detention center with an undisclosed location described as a dungeon. Many of the controversial interrogations outlined in the report took place at Cobalt.Rahman, described in the report as a suspected Islamic extremist, underwent 48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower, and rough treatment, according to communications with CIA headquarters. Later, Rahman was shackled to the wall and made to lie on a cold concrete floor. He was stripped of all of his clothes except a sweatshirt. In the morning, guards discovered Rahman was dead, likely from hypothermia.Not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like thatThe report describes how detainees at Cobalt were subject to something called rough takedowns that included physical abuse. Approximately five CIA officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched.These takedowns were thoroughly planned and rehearsed and did cause physical harm to detainees. Rahman, for example, had abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, medical examiners found.One of the most discussed elements of the CIA report is the use of rectal feeding or rectal rehydration. In at least five cases, detainees were force fed through their anus. In one instance, a lunch of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused into a  detainee named Majid Khan, the report said.While current and former CIA officials have defended the practice as medically necessary, Physicians for Human Rights said in a statement that rectal feedings are, a form of sexual assault masquerading as medical treatment. The CIA’s chief of interrogations characterized rectal feeding as a demonstration of total control, the report said. Additionally, an unidentified individual in the report said the procedure was used to make people talk and helped to clear a person’s head.One detainee, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, as a result of rectal feeding was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse, the report said.We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positionsFor starters, they were not just made to stand in awkward positions. That tactic was used in addition to sleep deprivation methods that required detainees remain awake for up to 180 hours.Additionally, two detainees broke bones in their feet while trying to escape capture. Despite a CIA physician recommending they stay off their feet for several weeks, the two detainees were placed in standing sleep deprivation. One of the detainees was kept awake on his feet for 52 hours, the other for an undisclosed amount of time.Similar tactics were used on a detainee with a sprained ankle and on a detainee with a prosthetic leg.Detainees were often naked and shackled with their hands above their head in complete darkness and loud music blasting.In April 2006, President George W. Bush expressed discomfort when shown images of a detainee chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself, according to the reports’ account of CIA documents.Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from thisYou could probably successfully argue that death is a pretty lasting injury. As were the chronic hemorrhoids and anal fissure suffered by the detainee who faced rectal feeding.But there were additional injuries as well.Abu Zubaydah, a high-level target, was captured in a raid during which he sustained a gunshot wound. Despite the obvious need for medical attention, care was instead withheld to convey that it  was contingent on Zubaydah’s cooperation. The wound eventually deteriorated due to a combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the wound secondary to some of the stress techniques utilized at that stage, and the removal of formal obvious medical care, the report said.Zubaydah also lost an eye in custody and was subjected to waterboarding, a procedure that simulates drowning. In one session, he became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth. He was revived and vomited large amounts of water.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often described as the architect of the 9-11 plots, was waterboarded 183 times over 15 sessions.While King alleged no lasting injuries from this technique, the report indicates otherwise, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University.Methods were approved that if used only very sporadically might not have caused permanent damage, but they were used in combination and repeatedly over a course of sometimes weeks or months, Schanzer said. I think to write off those kinds of compounded injuries as being insignificant is totally inconsistent with the facts.King said, Nobody suffered any lasting injuries as a result of the CIA enhanced interrogation program. He also said downplayed the methods, claiming it was not a case where people were killed, and that the techniques amounted to people being made to stand in awkward in positions.This is the opposite of what the report showed. One need not agree with everything in it to conclude that someone did die, an eye was lost, detainees were made to stand on broken limbs and deprived of sleep for 180 hours.

Saddam Hussein had previously had twice nuclear programs going. He produced and used weapons of mass destruction. And he had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida.The latter claim is .Two major investigations disprove his point. The , the independent, bipartisan body created by Congress and President George W. Bush, examined links between al-Qaida and Hussein as part of its investigation into Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The commission’s report, released in 2004, found no evidence that isolated contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida operatives ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship or coordinated attacks against the United States.A 2007 assessment from the , the nonprofit research branch of the Pentagon’s Joint Forces Command, churned up a similar finding. The review, based on more than a half-million captured Iraqi documents, found no ‘smoking gun’  between al-Qaida and Hussein’s Iraq. They had little in common beyond supporting the same third-party militant groups in different countries, the report said.Cheney has made the claim for years but failed to present any evidence to support it, said Peter Neumann, a professor of war studies at King’s College in London.Fox News’ Bret Baier asked Cheney in a Dec. 10 interview if there was anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this?Cheney responded, Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those.The Geneva Conventions refer to four international treaties covering how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers should be treated when they can no longer fight, down to food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. There is a distinction, protection-wise, between captives who are prisoners of war and unlawful combatants, but it is misleading for Cheney to say those combatants are not covered by the Geneva Conventions.Really, these detainees would have had lower-level protections spelled out in the Geneva Conventions from the procedures detailed in the Senate report. Passages in the four conventions known as Common Article 3 say violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, as well as outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment are prohibited at all times.Experts pointed to the 2006 Supreme Court case Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, in which the court ruled against the Bush administration and found that Common Article 3 offers some basic, but not full, protection for detainees, and the ruling is binding in the United States.Detainees were not killed, suffered no lasting injuries?U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., tried to downplay the findings released in the 600-page executive summary of the Senate report, saying, This is not a case where people were killed.We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that, he added. We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. But again, nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this.But King’s statements don’t hold up from reading just one-tenth of the mostly classified study. His ludicrous claim is !To start, the report details how one man, suspected Islamic extremist Gul Rahman, died after being interrogated in Cobalt, an undisclosed, overseas detention center. Rahman experienced two days of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, darkness, isolation, a cold shower and rough treatment, according to a CIA cable to headquarters. The morning after being shackled to a wall, forced to lie on a cold concrete floor, and stripped of most of his clothes, Rahman was discovered dead, likely from hypothermia.In addition, CIA operatives performed takedowns of detainees that resulted in physical harm, and they also practiced rectal feeding or rectal rehydration, in which detainees were force-fed through their anus, at least five times. Detainee Mustafa al-Hawsawi was diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anual fissure and symptomatic rectal prolapse as a result of rectal feeding.Read more examples in theOne of the senators to decry the Senate committee’s report was U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who called the release of the executive summary reckless and irresponsible.The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. taxpayers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official, Rubio wrote in a with Sen. Jim. Risch, R-Idaho, on Dec. 8.His claim misses some context but is not too off-base, so it rates .The committee did not meet with CIA employees and contractors for face-to-face interviews, as they were under potential legal jeopardy, the report says.But then-CIA director Michael Hayden, who took helm of the agency years after the questioned techniques began, testified in a closed-door session.Plus, the committee drew from interviews of CIA officials by the agency’s inspector general, as well as the CIA’s oral history program and more than 6 million pages of CIA materials that included cables, reports, internal memos and emails.Finally, an old claim from then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting new attention on cable news as Democrats try to distance themselves from the CIA’s practices. In April 2009, as Democrats in Congress explored legal action against lawyers who approved CIA torture practices like waterboarding, reporters asked Pelosi if she and other key members of a House intelligence committee were brief about the practices in the fall of 2002.She said she received a CIA briefing about that only once, but we were not, I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used.What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel -- the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would.Further, she said, the point was that if and when they would be used, they could brief Congress at that time. ... My experience was they did not tell us they were using that, flat out. And any contention to the contrary is simply not true.A timeline prepared by the director of national intelligence put her claim in dispute, showing she and Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, were briefed on theenhanced interrogation techniques. Goss, who resigned from Congress in 2004 to lead the CIA until 2006, backed up this account.Pelosi insisted her briefing was about interrogation techniques considered for future use, which is not supported by Goss or the CIA timeline based on briefing notes. On the point about waterboarding, though, there is no definitive public document showing it was specifically discussed in her briefing, though it was mentioned in briefings for other members of the intelligence committee (who would be covered by her reference to we).",http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2014/dec/18/lots-fiction-few-facts-discussion-torture-report/,

While the program officially ended in 2009, the cover-up of these crimes appears to be ongoing. Many detainees were held by the CIA in pitch-dark windowless cells, chained to walls, naked or diapered, for weeks or months at a time. The CIA forced them into painful stress positions that made it impossible for them to lie down or sleep for days, to the point where many hallucinated or begged to be killed to end their misery. It used “waterboarding” and similar techniques to cause near suffocation or drowning, crammed detainees naked into tiny boxes, and prevented them from bathing, using toilets, or cutting their hair or nails for months. “We looked like monsters,” one detainee said of his appearance while in CIA custody. Much new information about detention and interrogation in the CIA program became public with the release in redacted form of the 499-page summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report in December 2014 (“Senate Summary”). The Senate Summary reported that the CIA subjected at least five detainees to “rectal feeding,” described in one case as infusing the pureed contents of a lunch tray into the detainee’s rectum via a medical tube, done “without evidence of medical necessity.” The Senate Summary also found that during a waterboarding session, one detainee became “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.” The CIA forced some detainees to stand for days on end without sleep while they had broken bones in their legs and feet, even though CIA personnel knew this would cause them long-term physical injury. A CIA cable described one detainee as clearly a broken man and on the verge of complete breakdown. Obama administration claims that legal obstacles prevent criminal investigations into torture by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are unpersuasive, and risk leaving a legacy of torture as a policy option. The US government has not adequately accounted for these abuses. It has an obligation under international law to prosecute torture where warranted and provide redress to victims, but it has done neither. No one with real responsibility for these crimes has been held accountable and the government has actively thwarted attempts on the part of victims to obtain redress and compensation in US courts. The Obama administration asserted that it conducted a criminal investigation of the CIA program through a Department of Justice inquiry led by a career prosecutor, Assistant US Attorney John Durham. The Durham investigation closed on August 30, 2012 without bringing any criminal charges. The apparent failure of the investigation to question current or former detainees undercuts any claims that it was thorough or credible. As set out in this report, Human Rights Watch concludes there is substantial evidence to support the opening of new investigations into allegations of criminal offenses by numerous US officials and agents in connection with the CIA program. These include torture, assault, sexual abuse, war crimes, and conspiracy to commit such crimes. In reaching this conclusion, we have drawn on our own investigations, media and other public reports, and the declassified information in the Senate Summary. But more evidence exists that has yet to be made public. We believe that an independent and impartial investigation that has access to the full Senate report, other information that the government continues to keep classified, and interviews with current and former detainees, would yield further evidence of crimes and identify more suspects than we do here. US officials who played a role in the process of creating, authorizing, and implementing the CIA program should be among those investigated for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes. They include: Acting CIA General Counsel John Rizzo, Assistant Attorney General for Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) Jay Bybee, OLC Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, an individual identified as “CTC Legal” in the Senate Summary, CIA Director George Tenet, National Security Legal Advisor John Bellinger, Attorney General John Ashcroft, White House Counsel Legal Advisor Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the Vice President David Addington, Deputy White House Counsel Timothy Flanigan, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Defense Department General Counsel William Haynes II, Vice President Dick Cheney, and President George W. Bush. In addition, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, CIA psychologist contractors who devised the program, proposed it to the CIA, and helped carry it out, should also be investigated for their role in the initial conspiracy. We believe there is also sufficient evidence to investigate others who were not necessarily part of the initial conspiracy but who later joined it. Individuals can join an already existing conspiracy if they are aware of the conspiracy’s unlawful aims, in this case torture, and take steps intended to help the conspiracy succeed. These would include those who reauthorized the program after the legal memos endorsing it—the “Torture Memos”— were withdrawn, those who supplied false information to the Justice Department upon which the Justice Department relied in providing reauthorization, and those who later oversaw operation of the CIA program. Others should not only be investigated for torture but also for offenses such as war crimes, assault, and sexual abuse. Even if individuals who carried out the torture can be said to have reasonably relied in good faith upon OLC memos or CIA guidance to justify their conduct—which, as detailed below, there is serious reason to doubt—considerable evidence exists that CIA officers and interrogators tortured detainees in ways that went beyond what was authorized. This report also considers and rebuts arguments that barriers to prosecution under US law—such as statutes of limitation, certain defenses, or a “specific intent” requirement—might make it impossible to pursue criminal cases. The failure to credibly investigate and prosecute torture committed in any territory under US jurisdiction violates US obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and other treaties to which the US is a party. Other countries and entities should open their own investigations into CIA torture and should exercise universal jurisdiction, where applicable, over US nationals and others implicated in torture or other abuses. Additionally, countries that were complicit or otherwise unlawfully assisted the CIA program should also conduct investigations into the alleged illegal conduct of their own nationals. Besides violating international law, the US government’s inaction in the face of clear evidence of torture sends a message to future US policymakers and officials that they too can commit torture and other ill-treatment and not fear being held accountable. Several presidential candidates for the 2016 elections have already indicated they would consider using so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” if they were to be elected. Holding government officials accountable for serious abuses is never easy; when high-level officials are involved, it can be politically divisive. But Human Rights Watch research over the past 25 years in dozens of countries has shown that forgoing criminal accountability carries a high price. (See particularly Human Rights Watch, Selling Justice Short (2009)). Lack of accountability may fuel future abuses and weaken the rule of law. Globally, the US unwillingness to prosecute CIA torture weakens US authority to oppose torture and other abuses abroad, provides a ready excuse for countries unwilling to prevent or prosecute torture in their own countries, and undermines global respect for the rule of law. The egregious abuse of prisoners in CIA custody and failure to hold anyone accountable has undermined global efforts to fight terrorism. Detainee abuse, including abuse of prisoners by the US military, has been used by terrorist groups to obtain new recruits and contributed to anti-US sentiment in many countries. Ultimately, the guilt or innocence of any of the US officials involved in organizing or carrying out the CIA program will rest with the criminal justice system. Suspects should be tried in criminal proceedings that comport with international due process and fair trial standards, including allowing them to challenge evidence, present defenses, and raise mitigating circumstances. But before these fundamental institutions of democratic rule can even be set in motion, US criminal justice officials need to first conduct credible investigations and bring charges where appropriate, requirements that have gone unmet for well over a decade since the first revelations of CIA torture after 9/11. This report is organized into three parts—credible investigations and prosecutions, redress, and international justice—reflecting different steps the US and other countries should take to pursue accountability for CIA program abuses. Credible Investigations and Prosecutions: The first part of this report examines some of the specific federal criminal charges that could be brought against US officials involved the CIA program. The most senior responsible officials should not be able to avoid culpability on the grounds that they relied on advice from White House lawyers stating that the interrogation techniques used on detainees did not amount to torture. This defense is weak not only because the legal reasoning was so poor that it was soon repudiated by other Bush administration lawyers and virtually all other legal professionals, but also because, in this case, those involved in the CIA program themselves helped create the legal advice being used as a shield to protect them from accountability for their alleged crimes. Officials in the CIA and at the White House should have known, from the moment the techniques in question were proposed, that they were violating the federal Torture Statute: the techniques were reverse-engineered from a program designed to train US special forces to endure torture, some were explicitly designated as torture by US courts, and many were banned in the US Army Field Manual for Intelligence Interrogations in effect at the time the abuse was approved. And there is evidence in the Senate Summary that officials actually knew that the techniques violated the Torture Statute. According to a Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility investigation (OPR investigation), the CIA, through its acting General Counsel John Rizzo, expressed concern about “criminal liability” under the Torture Statute and sought, but failed to obtain, a guarantee from the Justice Department’s Criminal Division that employees would not be prosecuted for use of the techniques. The Senate Summary also contains a reference to a draft letter to the attorney general from “CTC Legal” —a likely reference to someone in the legal department of the CIA’s counterterrorism center—acknowledging that the “aggressive methods” of interrogation the CIA was planning would violate the Torture Statute. While there are no records showing that the letter was sent, its existence shows that at least some CIA advisers believed from the beginning that the techniques being proposed were illegal. Finally, the OPR investigation also noted that in mid-2002 senior White House and CIA officials appear to have been involved in shaping the contents of the soon-to-be issued legal memos authorizing abusive interrogation techniques, with sections likely added at their request after the Justice Department refusal to give a non-prosecution guarantee. Viewed in this context, there is strong reason to conclude that the infamous and since discredited “Torture Memos” issued by the OLC in August 2002 authorizing techniques that many others had previously determined to be torture, should be viewed as little more than a legal fig leaf. “The position taken by the government lawyers in these legal memoranda amount to counseling a client as to how to get away with violating the law,” said John Gibbons, former chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, after the memos had been released. Other White House and CIA officials and OLC lawyers later joined the conspiracy by knowingly keeping in the dark government officials they knew would oppose the CIA program, allowing the conduct to continue despite knowledge detainees were being mistreated, and reauthorizing the program once original authorizations were revoked after news of torture by the US military at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq became public. CIA personnel also engaged in practices that went well beyond the illegal techniques “authorized” by the Torture Memos. Practices such as “rectal feedings,” use of water to induce near suffocation, and certain painful stress positions, were either not authorized or administered in ways that were not authorized. As such, the memos should not even be contemplated as a defense for such actions. Lastly, while the five-year federal statute of limitations for most federal crimes might be thought to present an insurmountable bar to prosecution, it should not apply to many of the crimes committed as part of the CIA program. It is not a bar to prosecutions for torture or conspiracy to torture when there is a “foreseeable risk that death or serious bodily injury” may result, or to prosecutions for the types of sexual abuse allegedly committed by CIA program personnel. For all federal conspiracy charges, moreover, the statute of limitations can be extended if perpetrators conceal a central component of the conspiracy, as seems to have been the case here. Redress: The second part of this report looks at the US government’s obligation to provide redress to victims of abuse, including compensation and rehabilitation services, guarantees of non-repetition (including through legislation and public statements), and public disclosure of relevant information. The Convention against Torture and other treaties require the US to provide redress for torture and other serious abuses, including arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance. Not only has the US failed to provide compensation or any other form of redress to detainees in CIA custody, the Obama administration has blocked every attempt by former detainees to bring civil suits in US courts by invoking doctrines of state secrecy, state immunity, and national security. International Justice: The third part of this report looks at the efforts of other governments to investigate CIA torture and related abuses that occurred in their countries. Investigations in other countries have targeted US officials as well as national officials alleged to have participated in or been complicit in CIA abuses. The duty to prosecute serious violations of international law lies primarily with domestic judicial authorities in the country with principal jurisdiction over the crime. This normally requires having a territorial link to the crime or the persons involved. However, third countries can also investigate and prosecute on the basis of universal jurisdiction—laws embodying the idea that certain crimes, including torture and war crimes, are so egregious that every state has an interest in bringing perpetrators to justice. The Convention against Torture contains a universal jurisdiction clause that places an affirmative duty on governments to prosecute suspects who come on their territory regardless of where the torture took place. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 relating to war crimes contains similar provisions. The US government’s failure to conduct its own thorough and credible investigations into allegations of torture increases the importance of states exercising universal jurisdiction for crimes alleged to have been carried out as part of the CIA program. Although the United States is not a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICC may also be an avenue to accountability for alleged abuses by US nationals in Afghanistan. The ICC is conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in Afghanistan, which includes alleged torture of detainees by US armed forces there. Whether the preliminary examination will lead to a formal investigation was not known as this writing.The September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States took the lives of nearly 3,000 people and had an impact that reverberated, and still reverberates, around the globe. Following those attacks, President George W. Bush publicly sought and soon obtained from Congress the authority to use force against those responsible for the attacks and those assisting them. Six days after the attacks, on September 17, Bush secretly issued what is known as a Memorandum of Notification (MON)—a covert action directive that granted the CIA unprecedented counterterrorism authority, including to capture and detain individuals posing a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities. The MON made no reference to interrogations or coercive interrogation techniques. The CIA immediately began developing a plan to detain individuals under the MON. Senior agency leadership acknowledged that the CIA had limited experience running detention facilities and considered acquiring expertise from the Defense Department and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In late March 2002 the CIA captured Abu Zubaydah, who became its first detainee. Plans then intensified to establish the use of certain aggressive interrogation techniques. Arguments ensued between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the CIA over the types of interrogation techniques that should be used. The FBI wanted to use methods that they had developed for years that did not involve violence or force. FBI agents and officers involved in these discussions said the aggressive techniques the CIA sought to use were not only ineffectual, but would taint any evidence they acquired for use in criminal trials. The CIA proposed the use of 12 interrogation techniques. The techniques, proposed by two CIA contractors, had previously been used by the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) to train US Special Forces to better endure interrogation methods used by enemies who did not abide by the Geneva Conventions. The 12 “enhanced interrogation techniques” proposed were: (1) the attention grasp; (2) “walling”; (3) facial hold; (4) facial slap; (5) cramped confinement; (6) wall standing; (7) stress positions; (8) sleep deprivation; (9) waterboarding; (10) use of diapers; (11) use of insects; and (12) mock burial. When it was clear that the CIA was going to use such methods, the FBI refused to participate in any further interrogations using “enhanced interrogation techniques” or participate in any further discussions about the matter. As detailed below, the decision to use these techniques was discussed extensively among senior US officials, including but not limited to: CIA General Counsel John Rizzo, Assistant Attorney General and OLC head Jay Bybee, OLC Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, an unnamed individual identified as “CTC Legal” in the Senate Summary, CIA Director George Tenet, National Security Legal Advisor John Bellinger, Attorney General John Ashcroft, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the Vice President David Addington, Deputy White House Counsel Timothy Flanigan, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. Before the CIA used the full panoply of these techniques on Abu Zubaydah, the agency sought a guarantee that the Justice Department Criminal Division would not prosecute any US personnel involved. The Criminal Division refused. Following this, the CIA began working intensely with the attorneys in the OLC to obtain memos that would authorize the techniques proposed. (Meetings and deliberations about the content of the memos are discussed in detail below.) Two memos were eventually issued on August 1, 2002. The principal author of the memos was Yoo and they were signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee. The first memo was addressed to Gonzales and became known as the “Bybee I Memo.” It was unclassified and analyzed the domestic and international legal prohibitions on torture and, among other things, articulated an exceedingly high threshold, later repudiated by the Bush administration, for what constitutes torture: physical pain equivalent in intensity to that accompanying “organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.” It did not discuss the legality of any particular technique nor the legality of applying any type of technique on a specific detainee. It was not made public until it was leaked to the media in June 2004. The second memo, which was classified, was addressed to John Rizzo but also signed by Bybee, became known as the “Bybee II Memo.” It was not released publicly until 2009 and discussed the legality of each of the techniques individually, approving 10 specific interrogation tactics proposed for use on detainee Abu Zubaydah.[15] (“Diapering” and the “mock burial,” though initially proposed, were not discussed in the memo). These two memos collectively have publicly become known as the “Bybee Memos,” the “August 1, 2002 OLC Memos,” or the “Torture Memos.” After these memos were issued, the CIA began using what they called “enhanced interrogation techniques” with little guidance. The CIA now admits that its guidance was poor during this period. At some point after “enhanced interrogation techniques” and detentions were contemplated, the CIA began opening and operating a number of secret detention centers around the world. The US government has still not disclosed exactly where and how many sites it operated. Though a number of CIA sites are identified in the Senate Summary, they are designated using pseudonyms for their locations. But the media and others have long reported that the CIA operated detention centers in at least Afghanistan, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. Additionally, the CIA worked in conjunction with a number of other countries to operate, run or use detention sites in locations that included but were not limited to Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, and Egypt. During the course of the CIA program, the agency held at least 119 individuals in CIA-run detention centers, according to the Senate Summary. This is a conservative estimate and does not include a number of detainees who were unlawfully rendered as part of the CIA program. The full name for the CIA Program was the “Rendition, Detention and Interrogation” (RDI) program. Unlawful renditions were a part of the program but the Senate Summary did not address this aspect of it.[25] The summary lists only the names of 119 individuals it considers to be “detainees” in that there was “clear evidence of detention in CIA custody.”[26] Left off the list are an unknown number of individuals whom the CIA unlawfully rendered to countries where it was known or recognized as likely that they would be tortured, whether as part of their interrogation or as punishment.[27] Many of those rendered described being held by the CIA or by another government with the CIA’s cooperation, either before or after their transfer.[28] Of the 119 individuals the CIA considers to have been CIA “detainees,” according to the Senate Summary, at least 26 were “wrongfully held,” and did not meet the CIA’s own standards for detention. “CIA records provide insufficient information to justify the detention of many other detainees.” In November 2002, detainee Gul Rahman died from hypothermia after being shackled half-naked to a concrete floor overnight in CIA custody at a detention site in Afghanistan. His death spurred an investigation by the CIA Office of the Inspector General (OIG), including into the broader CIA program. The findings, issued in classified form in a May 2004 report (“CIA OIG Report”), were sharply critical of the both the CIA’s use of techniques in an authorized manner, and the use of techniques not authorized. While the OIG investigation was ongoing, media outlets began reporting that the US was using abusive interrogation methods on detainees in secret detention centers. To counter these reports, the Bush administration began putting out a number of statements aimed at alleviating concerns that the US might be abusing or torturing prisoners. These statements attempted to discount any possibility that the US was using torture and to emphasize that all detainees were being treated humanely even if they were not, in the administration’s view, protected by international law. These statements caused concern among the CIA leadership that other parts of the executive branch were not backing the CIA’s program. The CIA began to seek assurances from Secretary of State Rice, the OLC, and other executive branch departments that they continued to support the CIA program. This generated another series of high-level meetings during which the CIA secured reassurance that the White House and the Justice Department backed the program. After the CIA OIG Report was issued, CIA Director Tenet suspended both the use of what were called “standard” interrogation techniques, as well as “enhanced interrogation techniques,” pending a legal and policy review. The CIA OIG Report also called for the CIA to justify the usefulness and necessity of the “enhanced interrogation” program. Even before the OLC and the CIA approved the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” the US military had already begun using some of the tactics later authorized in the August 1, 2002 OLC Memos and had trained military interrogators in their use. Formal OLC and CIA approval set the stage for more widespread use of abusive techniques by the military. In March 2004, reports and photographs emerged about detainee abuse by US military personnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq causing a national scandal. And in June 2004, the Bybee I Memo was leaked to the media. By this time Yoo had left OLC, and Jack Goldsmith was named to replace him. Goldsmith reexamined the August 1, 2002 memos and concluded that the Bybee I Memo was “riddled with error” and a “one-sided effort to eliminate any hurdles posed by the torture law.” On May 3, 2004, in an attempt to get reassurance from OLC that they still endorsed the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” Muller wrote Goldsmith asking that he reaffirm OLC approval of the techniques as well as approve new ones. On May 27, Goldsmith wrote back to Muller saying that he strongly recommended” that the CIA suspend use of waterboarding and review steps taken to ensure that in actual practice any use of CIA techniques “adheres closely to the assumptions and limitations in the August 2002 opinion [the Bybee memos].” On June 15, 2004, Goldsmith withdrew the Bybee I Memo and submitted his letter of resignation the following day. Goldsmith kept in place OLC approval for all of the enhanced interrogation techniques other than waterboarding but subject to the assumptions, limitations, and safeguards laid out in the Bybee II Memo, which had not been withdrawn. Daniel Levin, who took over as acting head of the OLC after Goldsmith’s departure, inherited the task of issuing replacement memos for the Bybee I and Bybee II memos. On August 6, 2004, he issued a memo authorizing waterboarding and on December 30, 2004, issued a new legal opinion to replace the unclassified Bybee I Memo. Levin’s replacement memo, like the Bybee I memo, analyzed the legal limits of the prohibitions on torture but it acknowledged that the prior legal reasoning was wrong. Levin planned to draft a new memo to replace the classified Bybee II Memo as well but he left the office in February 2005 before he had finished those memos. The OLC deputy head, Stephen Bradbury, temporarily took over Levin’s vacant position. He issued two new memos, both on May 10, 2005, intended to replace the Bybee II classified memo. One discussed the legality of individual interrogation techniques and authorized all of the same techniques approved in the Bybee II memo, but with new legal reasoning (“Bradbury Individual Techniques Memo”). The memo also authorized several techniques that had not been the subject of OLC opinions but had already been used by the CIA, such as “water dousing” and “nudity.” The second May 10, 2005 memo addressed the techniques covered in the Bradbury Individual Techniques Memo but clarified that their use in combination with one another would not violate the Torture Statute (“Bradbury Combined Techniques Memo”). Though previously not approved by official OLC memo on any detainee other than Abu Zubaydah, and even then only in cursory fashion, the CIA had since the start of the program frequently used multiple “enhanced interrogation techniques” in combination. A third memo, issued on March 30, 2005, analyzed whether the techniques would violate the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment prohibited under the Convention against Torture, and found that they would not (“Bradbury CIDT Memo”). In December 2005, the US Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which barred the use of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment against any detainee in US custody and required the Defense Department to follow the US Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogations when conducting interrogations. In a speech on September 6, 2006, President Bush formally disclosed the existence of the CIA interrogation program to the public. He announced that a “small number” of detainees had been held by the CIA in locations that he could not disclose and praised the program for having “saved innocent lives.” He also announced that the remaining 14 detainees in CIA custody at the time would be sent to the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. But he did not end the CIA program at this time. He said it needed to continue because it was “crucial to getting lifesaving information.” As late as July 20, 2007, the OLC issued yet another memo authorizing the CIA to use techniques that were abusive, asserting that they would not violate US laws against torture and other ill-treatment or the newly enacted Detainee Treatment Act. President Barack Obama, on his second full day in office on January 22, 2009, signed an executive order closing the CIA’s secret detention facilities and ending the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques.” The CIA Program: What Was Known before the Senate Summary Before release of the Senate Summary, substantial information had already been published about the CIA program. As early as December 2002, accounts began to emerge of the CIA subjecting detainees to stress positions, unlawful renditions, and other forms of abuse. Following these initial reports, various media outlets and human rights organizations sought to document CIA activities more extensively. As early as 2003, Human Rights Watch had already interviewed persons in Afghanistan with information about CIA detention and, in a series of reports on “Ghost Detainees,” we had published initial information on dozens of detainees who had disappeared into US custody. Especially after news broke of torture and other abuse of detainees by the US military at Abu Ghraib, media outlets and rights organizations frequently reported on CIA abuse of detainees, US efforts to circumvent laws prohibiting torture and other ill-treatment, and the existence of secret CIA detention sites. The US Military’s Approval and Use of Torture and Other Ill-Treatment The harm of CIA torture was compounded by the US military’s adoption of many of the CIA-approved interrogation techniques. The military’s use of the techniques dates to December 2001, when the Office of the Secretary of Defense inquired into the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) program. SERE methods were being used by the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) to train US Special Forces to endure interrogation methods used by enemy forces that did not abide by the laws of armed conflict. These techniques, many drawn from the experiences of US service members captured by North Korea during the Korean War, included stripping detainees naked for degradation purposes, exploiting cultural or religious taboos, use of forced standing, exposure to cold, and prolonged sleep deprivation. The CIA later drew on these same SERE techniques to create its “enhanced interrogation” program. In February 2002, JPRA personnel began providing training and written materials to personnel in or headed to Guantanamo and Afghanistan. In July the CIA proposed the use of SERE-derived interrogation techniques with the first detainee held by the CIA, Abu Zubaydah. In mid-September 2002, just after the OLC issued its first memo authorizing CIA torture, JPRA staff began training Guantanamo personnel in the use of abusive SERE school techniques. In late September 2002, a delegation of senior officials, including Defense General Counsel William Haynes, White House General Counsel Alberto Gonzales, CIA General Counsel John Rizzo, and Chief of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department Michael Chertoff, visited the military detention facility at Guantanamo to discuss how interrogations were being managed there. The evidence available suggests that the group encouraged the practices. By October 2002 Guantanamo commander Maj. Gen. Michael Dunlavey was requesting authority to use more aggressive interrogation techniques including stress positions; isolation for up to 30 days; deprivation of light and sound; exploiting individual phobias such as fear of dogs; forced grooming; use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences were imminent for him or his family; and waterboarding. In 2003, several media outlets began to report on CIA interrogation techniques.[88] In March 2004 details of an army investigation into prisoner abuse in Iraq began to surface.[89] In April CBS published photos of the abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. And in May The New Yorker published an extensive expose about the abuse.[90] Then in June, one of the Bybee memos purportedly authorizing the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” was leaked to the media.[91] Haynes submitted a memo to Rumsfeld asking that he approve most of the methods Dunlavey requested, with the exception of waterboarding. On December 2, 2002, Rumsfeld approved most of the recommended techniques and appended a handwritten note to his authorization of these techniques: “I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to 4 hours?” Roughly two weeks later after concerns about Rumsfeld’s order were raised with Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora, Mora in turn, raised his concerns with Haynes among others. After asserting pressure but still not receiving assurances that the orders would be rescinded, Mora met with Haynes warning him that the “interrogation policies could threaten Secretary Rumsfeld's tenure and could even damage the presidency.”[75] On January 15 2003, uncertain whether there would be any change to the interrogation policy, Mora delivered a draft memorandum to Haynes stating that the majority of the proposed techniques violated domestic and international laws, at minimum constituting “cruel and unusual treatment and, at worst, torture.” Mora told Haynes that he would not sign the memorandum unless Rumsfeld rescinded his order. Rumsfeld did so on January 15, 2003 but at the same time said that commanders could get approval for the techniques if they asked for it and provided justification. On April 16, 2003, Rumsfeld issued a new memorandum that, while more restrictive than the December 2002 rules, still allowed techniques that went beyond what the laws of war permitted, including isolation, dietary manipulation, and sleep adjustment. Because of President Bush’s February 7, 2002 decision to reject the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to Al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, there was no overarching prescribed interrogation regime for prisoners held there. In late 2002, Special Mission Unit Task Force (SMU TF) officials from Afghanistan visited Guantanamo, compared notes on techniques from JPRA, and started drawing up a more formal list of techniques to be specifically authorized. A large portion of the SMU TF policies were based on Rumsfeld’s December 2, 2002 authorization and the legal reasoning behind the denial of wartime protections to Al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. In January 2003, in response to a Joint Staff inquiry from US Central Command, the US military command in Afghanistan submitted a list of interrogation techniques then in use in Afghanistan. The list included techniques “similar” to those Rumsfeld had approved for Guantanamo even though that memo had been technically rescinded. When the command in Afghanistan received no complaints, it interpreted the silence to mean the techniques were unobjectionable. Many US military and intelligence personnel sent to Iraq then based their interrogation policies on those formulated by the SMU TF in Afghanistan. For example, Capt. Carolyn Wood, who had helped develop interrogation policies for regular US forces in Afghanistan in late 2002—and who was implicated in the beating deaths of two detainees there in December 2002—was stationed in Iraq and put in command of Abu Ghraib interrogation operations in mid-2003. In July 2003, Captain Wood drafted a proposed interrogation policy based on the Afghanistan and Iraq SMU TF guidelines. This included the presence of military working dogs, stress positions, sleep management, loud music, and light control. Around the same time, in August 2003, Gen. Geoffrey Miller, who oversaw Guantanamo interrogation efforts, went to Iraq to conduct a counterterrorism assessment. He brought with him interrogation policy guidelines for Guantanamo that he gave to Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the overall US military commander for Iraq, and proposed them as a model. Sanchez used both Wood’s proposed policy and the Guantanamo guidelines to come up with interrogation guidelines for Iraq that he issued on September 14, 2003. The abusive techniques approved, along with other techniques used by the SMU TF units, were among those being used at Abu Ghraib prison when the scandal connected to abuse there became public in 2004. The US military record on criminal accountability for abuse of detainees post-9/11 has been abysmal. In 2007, Human Rights Watch collected information on some 350 cases of alleged abuse involving more than 600 military personnel. Few had been punished. The highest-ranking officer prosecuted for the abuse of prisoners was a lieutenant colonel, Steven Jordan, court-martialed in 2006 for his role in the Abu Ghraib scandal. He was acquitted in 2007. In subsequent years, media outlets and human rights groups documented or obtained information relating to the abusive interrogations of roughly 25 CIA detainees,[92] but information on the treatment of scores of other detainees remains unavailable. Freedom of Information Act requests and lawsuits brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others compelled the government to disclose a number of documents related to the CIA program.[93] But many other documents remain classified, including the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification purportedly granting the CIA authority to covertly capture and detain individuals posing “a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities, and 11 CIA Office of Inspector General reports related to the CIA program.[95] In 2007 reports emerged that the CIA had destroyed 92 videotapes depicting two CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, being interrogated and subjected to the use of CIA torture techniques—including waterboarding. In 2008, the US Department of Justice appointed Special Prosecutor John Durham to look into the tape destruction.[97] After Barack Obama took office, his attorney general, Eric Holder, expanded the Durham investigation to include a preliminary investigation into whether federal laws were violated as part of the CIA interrogation program. Holder said his decision to expand the investigation was based in part on a report produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) finding that two OLC attorneys, John Yoo and Jay Bybee (see below), had engaged in professional misconduct in authorizing the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” and recommending that prior determinations by the Justice Department not to prosecute CIA abuses be reexamined. (The OPR Report had not been made public at the time of Holder’s announcement and was not disclosed until February 2010). It was also based on a then still-classified 2004 CIA Inspector General report. Holder, however, also set strict limits to the Durham inquiry, making clear that “the Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees.” That preliminary investigation looked into 101 cases of alleged CIA abuse. On November 9, 2010, Holder announced that the Justice Department would not press charges against anyone for destruction of the CIA videotapes depicting the interrogation of two detainees. On June 30, 2011, he announced the closure, with no charges filed, in 99 of the 101 cases. Holder provided little explanation for the decision not to press charges other than to say that Durham had concluded that many of the 101 detainees were never in CIA custody. If that is the case it raises questions about who had custody of the detainees, where they were, and why this meant CIA personnel were not responsible for any wrongdoing. Holder also said that he would open full investigations into the cases of the two remaining detainees, both of whom had died in US custody.[109] A year later, on August 30, 2012, Holder announced the closure of these cases without bringing any charges.[110] In closing the investigation, Holder said he made his decision because “the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.”[111] The Durham investigation was primarily focused only on CIA abuse that went beyond what was authorized. This limitation was always too narrow in scope because the authorizations not only permitted interrogation methods in violation of US and international law, but also because they appear to have been designed specifically to create a legal escape hatch for what would otherwise be the illegal use of torture. Even within the administration-imposed restraints, the investigation appears wholly inadequate. There is no evidence that Durham investigators interviewed any of the detainees in the CIA program, whether still detained or since released.[113] In November 2014 five former CIA detainees who alleged that they had been badly tortured by the CIA asserted in a public letter that Durham never spoke to them during his investigation. They urged the UN Committee against Torture to question the US delegation about this during the impending review of US compliance with the Convention against Torture. Other organizations working with former detainees held by the CIA and detainee defense counsel also report that the Durham team never spoke to their clients. When the Committee against Torture, charged with reviewing state compliance with the Convention against Torture, asked the US delegation whether any former detainees had been interviewed, the delegation was unwilling to provide an answer. Instead, David Bitkower, deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, newly disclosed that the Durham investigation had interviewed approximately 96 witnesses, but he would not say whether any of them were former CIA detainees.[117] The US response provoked the following statement from the committee: The Committee regrets … that the delegation was not in a position to describe the investigative methods employed by Mr. Durham or the identities of any witnesses his team may have interviewed. Thus, the Committee remains concerned about information before it that some former CIA detainees, who had been held in U.S. custody abroad, were never interviewed during the investigations, casting doubts as to whether this high-profile inquiry was properly conducted.

These included operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda, and emails, briefing materials, interview transcripts, contracts, and other records. Notably, the staff members did not have access to more than 9,400 documents that the CIA withheld, reportedly asserting the executive privilege on behalf of the White House. The full 6,700-page report was completed in December 2012.[121] However, it took nearly two years for the Senate Intelligence Committee to decide to release the Summary and for the US government to conduct declassification review. The Summary, still partially redacted, was released on December 9, 2014. It is 499 pages long; the remainder of the full report remains classified. The Summary—and likely the full report—focuses exclusively on the CIA; it does not cover abuses by other US government agencies, including the military. It also does not address the issue of CIA renditions abroad. The Summary’s main findings are that the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” was not an effective means of gathering useful intelligence; that the CIA inflated claims that the techniques were necessary to thwart terrorist attacks; and that the techniques used were far more brutal than previously thought. The Summary covers many facts that were already well-known, but also includes many new details, including: A list of all detainees that the US government says it detained in the CIA detention and interrogation program. However, the US has still not released the names and identities of detainees the CIA did not itself hold for a significant time period but instead rendered to other countries. New details about the methods used in the CIA program. For example, the Summary discloses that the CIA subjected detainees to “rectal feedings,” in which CIA personnel forcibly inserted tubes into the rectums of detainees and infused pureed food into their bodies, which the Summary and medical experts conclude was not medically necessary. Evidence of interrogators’ intent to cause severe pain and suffering. This includes, for example, details on how interrogators used excessively large tubes to conduct rectal feedings, or forced detainees into positions that required them to stand for days in order to deprive them of sleep when they already had broken bones in their legs, knowing it would cause permanent and lasting physical injury. The disclosure that the CIA paid the company that Mitchell and Jessen formed and was put in charge of implementing, carrying out and evaluating the effectiveness of the CIA program, $81 million dollars. The disclosure that Federal Bureau of Prisons officials visited one of several CIA detention facilities in November 2002 in Afghanistan and were “wow’ed” by the degree of sensory deprivation there. Accounts of multiple detainees being subjected to water torture in ways that, according to an interrogator, were virtually “indistinguishable” from waterboarding and were unauthorized. Such accounts and prior reporting contradict Senate testimony by then-CIA Director Michael Hayden that only three detainees had ever been waterboarded. Evidence that the CIA recognized that the “enhanced interrogation techniques” were unlawful. This can be inferred from, among other things, the CIA’s request for Justice Department guarantees not to prosecute such practices under federal laws prohibiting torture and CIA lawyers’ acknowledgment in a draft letter to the US attorney general that use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” would be barred by anti-torture laws. Details about the various steps the CIA took to cover up possible criminal activity and obstruct the democratic process, including by making false claims to the Justice Department, the White House, and Congress about the scope, nature, successes, and necessity of the interrogation program. Efforts the administration took to keep senior members of its National Security Council and Defense Department team in the dark about the program. The Senate Summary also places these and other facts in the context of US decision-making and explains how the Bush administration came to adopt, authorize, and approve a government-sanctioned program of torture and enforced disappearance around the globe. It should be recognized, however, that although the Senate Summary provides important new details about the interrogation program, it remains an account told largely from the government’s perspective. The voices of the detainees who were subjected to torture are not included. US Response to the Senate Summary Evidence has long been available that US officials and agents violated US federal law, as well as international law, in connection with the CIA’s rendition, detention, and interrogation program.[124] Failure to prosecute torture is itself a violation of the Convention against Torture. The release of the Senate Summary puts forward further evidence of wrongdoing that the US government is obligated under international law to investigate and appropriately prosecute, as well as provide redress to victims. However, the US has largely failed to act. The Obama administration and others have put forward three broad reasons why the US need not and should not conduct criminal investigations into alleged abuses by US officials connected to the CIA interrogation program: “An investigation was already conducted”: The Obama administration’s main argument to justify no action is that it already conducted an investigation into these events, pointing to the Durham inquiry. “Prosecutions would be politically harmful”: President Obama famously said after his election but before taking office that he “had a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards.” Commentators supporting this approach contend that prosecutions, brought largely against Bush-era officials, would invariably be divisive for the nation. “Prosecutions of those involved in the CIA program are not viable under US law”: Some observers have concluded that it may not be possible to charge those responsible for CIA abuses due to difficulties in proving intent, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the applicability of other defenses. As mentioned above, international human rights law, notably the Convention against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), obligates states to conduct impartial investigations and appropriately prosecute government officials responsible for torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The UN Committee against Torture has stated that a government’s obligation “to investigate, punish, and prevent further torture or ill-treatment in the future” should give “particular attention to the legal responsibility of both the direct perpetrators and officials in the chain of command, whether by acts of instigation, consent or acquiescence.” The Committee considers it “essential” that the “responsibility of any superior officials, whether for direct instigation or encouragement of torture or ill-treatment or for consent or acquiescence therein, be fully investigated through competent, independent and impartial prosecutorial and judicial authorities.” The UN Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitors state compliance with the ICCPR, has stated that where investigations uncover human rights violations, governments “must ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. As with failure to investigate, failure to bring to justice perpetrators of such violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant.” The Committee noted that impunity for arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances, among other abuses, “may well be an important contributing element in the recurrence of the violations.” Neither the Durham inquiry with its narrow mandate and inadequate investigation, nor Obama’s decision to give priority to political considerations, overcome US obligations under international law to prosecute serious human rights violations. In the following section we will discuss in detail the third reason proffered not to prosecute, that prosecutions of US officials for torture may not or may no longer be legally viable.II. Bringing Criminal Prosecutions in the US There are several federal offenses that senior US officials, as well as other US personnel, can be charged with concerning the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation techniques.” The following sections discuss the main charges that should be considered. Not discussed here are possible charges against those alleged to have made false claims to federal officials or government bodies, or to have obstructed justice. The key charges are torture, conspiracy to torture, and conspiracy as a stand-alone crime. Assault, sexual abuse, war crimes and murder, as well as conspiracy to commit some of these crimes, are separate offenses that prosecutors can also pursue.[133] The level of culpability of those charged will vary widely depending on such factors as their involvement in authorizing and implementing or carrying out the program, whether their acts were authorized by the Justice Department, and whether mitigating circumstances apply. Charges could be brought for the actual completed offense or for attempting, or aiding and abetting, the offense. The US enacted what is referred to here as the Torture Statute to comply with its obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Convention against Torture).[134] President Ronald Reagan had signed the Convention in 1988 and Congress enacted the Torture Statute in 1994 to comply with the Convention. Reagan said at the time the treaty was ratified that the US “will demonstrate unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent practice of torture.” The Torture Statute provides criminal penalties for torture, conspiracy to commit torture, and attempts to commit torture occurring outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, regardless of the citizenship of the perpetrator or victim.[136] The Torture Statute defines torture as “an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering … upon another person within his custody or physical control.”[137] To prosecute the crime of conspiracy to torture, prosecutors would have to prove the elements of conspiracy, as well as conspiracy to commit the offense of torture under the Torture Statute. The definition of torture under the Convention against Torture requires that it be “intentionally inflicted.”[138] When ratifying the treaty, the US included an understanding containing similar wording—that in order for an act to constitute torture, it must be “specifically intended” to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.[139] The US later included this “specifically intended” language in the Torture Statute.[140] The Senate Summary provides evidence of numerous instances in which US officials demonstrably sought to inflict severe pain or suffering. Even absent such specific intent, there are other serious crimes with which officials might be charged. Federal courts have not interpreted the term “specifically intended” in reviewing a criminal case. However, several US courts have interpreted the language in the immigration context in deciding whether individuals have valid challenges to removal because they face torture in the country to which they would be transferred.[142] In most of these cases courts have followed the lead of Auguste v. Ridge, a 2005 appellate court decision upholding an order of removal, which found that the “specifically intended” language in the Senate’s reservation requires a showing of the “specific intent” standard used in US criminal prosecutions.[143] The court noted that the specific intent standard is a “term of art” that is “well-known in American jurisprudence” meaning that “in order for an individual to have acted with specific intent, he must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act.”[144] But in the criminal context, the meaning of “specific intent” is anything but clear.[145] As a respected treatise on criminal law notes, courts apply the meaning of “specific intent” in a variety of ways.[146] Some courts suggest that specific intent requires a conscious desire, or “purpose” to produce the proscribed result—in this case severe pain and suffering—“whatever the likelihood of that result happening from the conduct.”[147] Other cases suggest that only knowledge or notice that an act will likely result in the proscribed outcome is necessary for “specific intent” and that the notice element will be satisfied by the reasonable foreseeability of the natural and probable consequences of one’s act.[148] Some academics have challenged the notion that the Senate even intended to create a “specific intent” crime with its reservation to the treaty.[149] And, while the infamous Bybee Torture Memos of August 1, 2002 interpreted the Torture Act’s language as including a heightened specific intent requirement, less than two years later, the OLC would repudiate that interpretation (see below). Regardless, even using the heightened standard articulated in Auguste, the available evidence indicates that the architects of the CIA Program specifically intended torture. Proof of that intent may be inferred from the total facts and circumstances of the case and does not require direct evidence of the accused's mental state. In fact, the process that led to the creation of the Torture Memos, and the memos themselves, are evidence of intent to torture. Senior US officials who devised and authorized the CIA program did not actually carry out torture themselves, but there is a strong case that they engaged in a conspiracy to torture. In order to prove conspiracy under US law, there must be: (1) an agreement, (2) among two or more persons, (3) for an unlawful purpose, and (4) at least one overt act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.[153] The overt act need not be illegal. It is also necessary to demonstrate that conspirators intended to agree to commit elements of the underlying offense, in this case torture. For conspiracy, the agreement can be inferred from direct or circumstantial evidence.[155] No proof of an express agreement is required. As one court noted, “criminal conspiracies are by their very nature clandestine, and a tacit agreement inferred from the surrounding circumstances can—and often does—suffice to ground a finding of willing participation.” The crime is frequently established as a result of inferences drawn from the acts of persons accused.[157] Relevant circumstantial evidence can include: “the joint appearance of defendants at transactions and negotiations in furtherance of the conspiracy; the relationship among codefendants; mutual representation of defendants to third parties; and other evidence suggesting unity of purpose or common design and understanding among conspirators to accomplish the objects of the conspiracy.”[158] Individuals can also join a conspiracy if there is sufficient evidence they did so with some knowledge of the conspiracy's “unlawful aims”—in this case torture—and with the intent of helping the conspiracy succeed.[159] In addition, under the doctrine of “conscious avoidance,” knowledge can be found where a defendant consciously avoided learning the fact while aware of the high probability of its existence, even if there is no evidence that the defendant possessed actual knowledge.[160] There is substantial evidence supporting charges of conspiracy to torture against senior US officials and CIA contractors, including evidence that some individuals joined the conspiracy after it was first established. After the US apprehension of Abu Zubaydah on March 28, 2002, someone identified as “CTC Legal” in the Senate Summary recommended that a psychologist working on contract in the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS)—identified in the Senate Summary as Dr. Grayson Swigert—be used by the CIA to “provide real-time recommendations to overcome Abu Zubaydah’s resistance to interrogation.” Not long thereafter Swigert, since identified as James Mitchell, and another psychologist identified in the Senate Summary as Dr. Harold Dunbar, since identified as Bruce Jessen, proposed that the CIA use 12 interrogation techniques on detainees.[162] These techniques included waterboarding, painful stress positions, walling, prolonged sleep deprivation, and cramped confinement among others— most of which were eventually approved for use by the OLC.[163] Mitchell and Jessen were ultimately hired as contractors by the CIA to develop the “enhanced interrogation technique” program, carry it out, and assess its effectiveness.[164] Officials in the CIA and at the White House knew or should have known, from the moment these techniques were proposed, that they violated the Torture Statute. First, the techniques were derived from those used in the Defense Department’s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program—a program designed to train US Special Forces to endure interrogation methods used by enemies who do not abide by the Geneva Conventions and the laws of war, which prohibit torture.[165] Second, the US Army’s field manual for intelligence investigations at the time prohibited many of the techniques the CIA was considering and ultimately approved using, such as “abnormal sleep deprivation” and “forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time,” and “food deprivation,” explicitly defining them as forms of torture.[166] Indeed, the Senate Summary includes strong evidence that CIA and senior White House officials did know, practically from the moment that they were first being considered, that these techniques violated the Torture Statute. According to a Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility investigation (OPR investigation), the CIA, through its acting General Counsel John Rizzo, expressed concern about “criminal liability” under the Torture Statute and sought a guarantee from the Justice Department that employees would not be prosecuted for use of these techniques. The Senate Summary also contains reference to a draft letter to the attorney general from “CTC Legal” —a likely reference to someone in the legal department of the CIA’s counterterrorism center, headed by Jonathan Fredman at the time[168] —asking for an advance guarantee not to prosecute any US employees or agents using “aggressive methods” of interrogation and acknowledging that these methods would otherwise be prohibited by the Torture Statute. The letter was drafted in July 2002 and circulated internally at the CIA, as well as to Mitchell, though the Senate Summary says there are no records showing that it was ever sent. The existence of the letter indicates that CIA legal advisers believed from the beginning that the techniques being proposed were likely illegal. At a July 13, 2002 meeting where the guarantee not to prosecute was discussed, Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division, refused to provide such a guarantee.[171] At that same meeting, Daniel Levin, chief of staff to the FBI director at the time, also reportedly said that the FBI would not participate in any interrogations employing “enhanced interrogation techniques,” whether they were found legal or not and that the FBI would not f",https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/01/no-more-excuses/roadmap-justice-cia-torture,

It says those claims are unsubstantiated by the CIA's own records. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)This post has been updated.Over the objections of the CIA, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released the findings of a long-awaited report on the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program, in which it subjected detainees to practices widely criticized as torture — what it called “enhanced interrogation techniques.” The agency has argued that even if the tactics were harsh, they were necessary. They helped to track down Osama bin Laden, the agency said, and the CIA even helped to underscore that idea by consulting on the Hollywood blockbuster Zero Dark Thirty.The exhaustive Senate report — the executive summary alone runs 500 pages — found that the program instead violated “U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values.” It was ineffective, the report found, and in some cases detrimental to national security, a fact the CIA worked to conceal from government agencies, the White House, lawmakers and the public. And it didn’t help to find bin Laden.The CIA, in a response posted to its website, acknowledged “shortcomings” in its interrogation program, and said that the agency had made “mistakes.” But it maintained that the program had been effective and that the CIA hadn’t “systematically and intentionally misled” officials or the public.The bulk of the Senate report’s information was gathered from the CIA’s own internal documents. Read the executive summary of the report here. We’ve outlined the most significant findings below.The report details numerous examples of harsh interrogation practices by the CIA, some previously reported, others new. At least five detainees were subjected to “rectal rehydration,” or rectal feeding without medical necessity. Detainees were slapped, slammed against walls and in some instances, exposed to sleep deprivation for up to seven-and-a-half days. Some were stuffed into coffin-sized boxes, and even threatened with death.“One interrogator told another detainee that he would never go to court, because ‘we can never let the world know what I have done to you,'” according to the report.The report also suggests that more prisoners may have been subjected to waterboarding — a practice that simulates the sensation of drowning — than the three cases previously acknowledged by the CIA. The waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah, the report notes, led him to become “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.” Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times and kept in crammed boxes for nearly 300 hours.CIA leadership told officials that 98 prisoners were in its detention program, but agency records show that at least 119 were actually held, according to the report. Of that number, “39 were subjected to the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques,” while at least 26 others “were wrongfully held.” Wrongfully held detainees included:Before 2004, the CIA subjected detainees to nudity, “dietary manipulation,” abdominal slapping and cold water dousing, even though neither technique had been approved by the Department of Justice. At least 17 detainees were put through enhanced interrogation without the approval of CIA headquarters, while “multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorization, or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorized to use them.”The CIA’s harshest interrogation methods didn’t help the agency gain valuable intelligence or gain the cooperation of detainees, the Senate report found.Instead, many detainees offered false information under duress, providing fake leads that the CIA nevertheless chased down as high priorities. Seven of the 39 CIA detainees exposed to enhanced interrogation produced “no intelligence” while in CIA custody. In one instance, the CIA held an Afghan national in solitary confinement for one month because he had the same name as someone they believed was targeting U.S. military bases.Plots the CIA claimed they “disrupted” were never in the works. Even the accurate intelligence the CIA received came from detainees before they were subjected to torture, the report found.That includes Hassan Ghul, who provided the key intelligence that led American officials to Osama bin Laden — the knowledge that the Al Qaeda leader was likely in Peshawar in Pakistan, and that he had a courier named Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti.When Ghul was handed over to the CIA, he wasn’t tortured at first. “He sang like a tweetie bird,” said one CIA official familiar with the initial interrogations. “He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset.”During this time, Ghul also offered accurate information on other top Al Qaeda operatives — their locations, movements, operational security and training, the report said.After two days, Ghul was transferred to Detention Site Black. He was “shaved and barbered, stripped, and placed in the standing position against the wall,” with “his hands above his head.”His interrogators asked for permission to use enhanced interrogation techniques. The request was approved by CIA headquarters that day.Ghul was subjected to 59 hours of sleep deprivation, which caused hallucinations. Although medical personnel were supposed to intervene and allow detainees to sleep once they began hallucinating, that didn’t always happen.A CIA doctor reported that Ghul suffered from “notable physiological fatigue,” “Abdominal and back muscle pain/spasm,” “mild paralysis of arms, legs and feet [that] are secondary to his hanging position and extreme degree of sleep deprivation.”He was told that the pain would stop when it was confirmed that he was telling the truth. Throughout all, Ghul repeated some of what he’d said initially, but offered no other useful information.On two separate occasions, in 2005 and 2011, the CIA would tell other government officials that Ghul had provided actionable intelligence after being subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Ghul was ultimately released.At the same time, the CIA program made it more difficult for the FBI, the State Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to address national security matters, the report found.The CIA held back important information from these agencies, kept them from speaking with detainees and lied about the extent of the program, the report found. When the head of the FBI, Robert Mueller, sought to interrogate CIA detainees to follow up on reports of threats to the U.S., those requests were denied.In most cases, the CIA also didn’t tell the State Department about so-called foreign “black sites” where it housed detainees, or where they were, even though the host countries “generally” knew. In two countries, the CIA told local government officials not to tell the U.S. ambassadors about a deal to host black sites in their countries.Years earlier, the report found, agency officials testified before Congress that “inhumane physical or psychological techniques are counterproductive because they do not produce intelligence and will probably result in false answers.”Even so, the agency never conducted an analysis of how effective its enhanced interrogation techniques were, despite recommendations by the agency’s own inspector general, and requests by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the national security adviser, the report found.Instead, the CIA conducted internal assessments by people who developed and ran the program. “There are no CIA records to indicate that any of the reviews independently validated the ‘effectiveness’ claims presented by the CIA,” the report found. The agency didn’t even confirm its own basic assertion that it had acquired useful information from the detainees.There was plenty of internal criticism, including from CIA officers who questioned how effective the methods were and spoke out against them, and recommendations from psychologists and the CIA Office of Medical Services. Those concerns were ignored — and at times officers were asked not to put their complaints in writing.The report found that the CIA prevented proper oversight of its interrogation program by providing “extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information” on the “operation and effectiveness” of its enhanced interrogation methods to officials at the White House and National Security Council.When Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet and CIA General Counsel Scott Muller met with Vice President Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and others in July 2003, they made the case that 50 percent of the CIA’s intelligence reports on Al Qaeda came from detainees, and warned that the “termination of this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive.”The report also reviewed 20 examples that the CIA held up as counterterrorism successes attributed to the use of enhanced interrogation methods and “found them to be wrong in fundamental respects.”The secretaries of defense and state were not briefed on the program until September 2003, and an internal CIA email from July 2003 noted that “the [White House] is extremely concerned [Secretary of State Colin] Powell would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what’s been going on.”The summary states that the CIA “consistently omitted” the intelligence gained from sources other than detainees who underwent enhanced interrogation, “leaving the false impression the CIA was acquiring unique information from the use of the techniques.”Based on the CIA’s own records, President George W. Bush wasn’t briefed on specific interrogation techniques until April 2006.When Bush finally was briefed, he expressed discomfort at the “image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself,” according to CIA records cited by the committee.The report also included an appendix detailing discrepancies between internal CIA records and the testimony of former CIA Director Michael Hayden before the Senate Intelligence Committee.In 2007, for example, Hayden asserted about Zubaydah that, “We knew he knew a lot. He would not talk. We were going nowhere with him.”However, the report concluded that more intelligence reports were gathered during the first two months of Zubaydah’s interrogation, before the CIA waterboarded him, than the two months during and after he was put through the practice.According to the report, the discrepancies in Hayden’s 2007 testimony involved the scope of the use of enhanced interrogation, its effectiveness in producing useful intelligence, screening and training processes for interrogators and dissent within the ranks, among other issues.The CIA presented “inaccurate” information to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which wrote several memos from 2002 to 2007 providing legal justification for the program. In particular, the CIA misrepresented:For example, when the OLC issued its “Standards of Conduct for Interrogation,” or what has come to be known as the “torture memo” in 2002, the memo relied on information provided by the CIA about Abu Zubaydah’s status and role in Al Qaeda, his resistance to questioning and his withholding of information on future plots. The committee’s report concludes that much of that information was “unsupported by CIA records.”",http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-cia-torture-report-what-you-need-to-know/,

The tactics were meant to condition detainees into a state of helplessness. Mitchell has said he was told by U.S. officials that the idea was to walk right up to the edge of the law.The case had been set to go before a jury on Sept. 5. Because of their status as contractors rather than government employees, the lawsuit had targeted Jessen and Mitchell as private citizens.Based in Spokane, Wash., the two psychologists were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two former prisoners and the family of one detainee who died of extreme cold in a secret CIA prison.The case was filed in October 2015, after the Senate intelligence committee released part of its report on the CIA's programs in which Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel's chairwoman, wrote that she had concluded that under any common meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured.Before elements of the Senate report were made public, the men's cases had been classified.Salim, Soud and Rahman were among the 119 detainees mentioned in the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report.Similar details of the detainees' treatment emerged from the plaintiffs and the Senate report: Prisoners were often held nude or nearly nude, left hanging by their arms or chained to the floor, confined in small places and subjected to intense cold.The defendants had repeatedly sought to dismiss the case, but it was allowed to proceed by U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush, who had urged the two sides to reach a deal before a trial began.The defendants issued a statement Thursday in which Jessen said, Neither Dr. Mitchell nor I knew about, condoned, participated in, or sanctioned the unauthorized actions that formed the basis for this lawsuit.We served our country at a time when freedom and safety hung in the balance, Jessen said, adding that the actions they took were legal and authorized and protected our country from another vicious attack.In recent hearings, the judge also noted that the federal government is paying for the team of defense attorneys for Mitchell and Jessen and would also fund any potential cash award by a jury, as The Spokesman-Review reported. Back in 2010, the AP and Mother Jones reported that the CIA had agreed to pay up to $5 million toward the psychologists' attorneys fees.As the settlement was announced Thursday, the plaintiffs said:The terms of the settlement are confidential. ACLU attorney Dror Ladin called it a historic victory for our clients and the rule of law, adding that it shows there are consequences for those accused of torture.In suing Mitchell and Jessen, the ACLU says, the plaintiffs accused them of torture; cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; nonconsensual human experimentation; and war crimes.Mitchell and Jessen's work stemmed from military psychologists' efforts to prepare U.S. soldiers for potential capture, subjecting them to isolation, insults, and waterboarding as part of a training program known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, or SERE. The pair were the first to propose applying the harsh tactics used in SERE training to detainees, as NPR's Alix Spiegel reported in 2009.On Thursday, Mitchell said that certain individuals performed acts on detainees, including plaintiffs, without our knowledge or consent, and without authorization from the CIA — acts that should not have occurred and for which we are not responsible.As part of the settlement, the psychologists and the former detainees agreed on a joint statement. It reads:Drs. Mitchell and Jessen acknowledge that they worked with the CIA to develop a program for the CIA that contemplated the use of specific coercive methods to interrogate certain detainees.  Plaintiff Gul Rahman was subjected to abuses in the CIA program that resulted in his death and in pain and suffering for his family, including his personal representative Obaidullah. Plaintiffs Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud were also subjected to coercive methods in the CIA program, which resulted in pain and suffering for them and their families. Plaintiffs assert that they were subjected to some of the methods proposed by Drs. Mitchell and Jessen to the CIA, and stand by their allegations regarding the responsibility of Drs. Mitchell and Jessen. Drs. Mitchell and Jessen assert that the abuses of Mr. Salim and Mr. Ben Soud occurred without their knowledge or consent and that they were not responsible for those actions. Drs. Mitchell and Jessen also assert that they were unaware of the specific abuses that ultimately caused Mr. Rahman's death and are also not responsible for those actions. Drs. Mitchell and Jessen state that it is regrettable that Mr. Rahman, Mr. Salim, and Mr. Ben Soud suffered these abuses.",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/17/544183178/psychologists-behind-cia-enhanced-interrogation-program-settle-detainees-lawsuit,

Peter King (R-NY) on Thursday doubled down on his argument that the harsh techniques detailed in a Senate report on the CIA’s Bush-era interrogation program did not amount to “torture.”MSNBC’s Kirsten Welker asked King to respond to Sen. John McCain’s (R-AZ) speech against torture on the Senate floor. King said that the treatment McCain underwent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam was not similar to the way the CIA treated its detainees.“What John McCain went through was far worse than anything that the detainees went through,” he said.That position is impossible to square with the death of one detainee held by the CIA after the 9/11 attacks. The Senate report revealed that the detainee, “who had been held partially nude and chained to a concrete floor,” died from hypothermia in 2002.Welker asked King directly whether that detainee’s death amounted to torture. King responded that several prosecutors had investigated the death and determined there was “no criminal intent.”“It was an accident, it occurred in a brief period of time,” he said. “And it was after that, that all of the measures went into effect to protect the detainees in the future.”King staunchly defended the CIA’s interrogation tactics after the Senate report was released. He told a New York radio station on Wednesday that neither waterboarding nor the painful stress positions to which the CIA subjected its detainees amounted to torture.“We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth,” he told WCBS. “Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this.”",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/peter-king-john-mccain-treated-worse-than-cia-detainees,

The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit, said all three men had been subjected to the CIA’s brutal techniques.","The CIA’s torture program, as explained by the psychologists who designed it","The former military psychologists who designed the CIA’s torture program are now describing it in their own words for the first time, reopening one of the grimmest chapters in Washington’s war on terror and providing disturbing details about what was done to detainees in the name of US national security.The New York Times obtained video footage from depositions of the two psychologists, John Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. A report by Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter Sheri Fink paints a troubling portrait of two men who say they were uncomfortable with some of what the CIA was asking them to do but continued their work anyway.The psychologists were speaking in response to a lawsuit filed by two former prisoners and the family of a prisoner who died, none of whom were ever charged with a crime. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit, said all three men had been subjected to the CIA’s brutal techniques.The report is particularly striking since we know that the president of the United States has made clear he has no moral objections to the use of torture, believes it generally works, and has only held back from authorizing it because of strong pushback from his national security team.“Would I feel strongly about waterboarding? As far as I’m concerned, we have to fight fire with fire,” said Donald Trump in a January interview with ABC News.We already know a lot about the CIA’s interrogation techniques from a 2014 Senate report, which found they were more brutal than had been initially thought and rarely led to much useful intelligence. But this is the first time the key individuals who approved and designed the program are speaking about it on the record.“This is the first case against the CIA in which victims and survivors have had their day in court,” Steven Watt, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said in an interview with Vox.Here are the most disturbing takeaways from the New York Times report.One of the main themes in Mitchell and Jessen’s depositions was their repeated claim that the techniques they designed and taught others to use were mostly painless and caused no long-term harm to the prisoners.But the former detainees at the heart of the ACLU suit, Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Mohamed Ben Soud, have said the techniques were painful.In his deposition, a judge asked Salim if he could describe the pain he experienced while being subjected to a stress position, a technique in which the detainees’ wrists were tied together above their heads and they were unable to lean against a wall or lie down.Salim said, “Maybe I need to tie you here for one hour so you can feel the pain if you want to know the pain.”He then broke down crying.The Senate report noted how one detainee was waterboarded 83 times over a period of days. At one point, he was completely unresponsive.But, using casual and somewhat flippant language, Jessen and Mitchell claimed they didn’t think the techniques would cause long-term trauma. From the New York Times:Both Salim and Soud suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Watt, and even participating in the trial has been an emotional and difficult experience for the men.“Walling” is a technique in which prisoners were repeatedly slammed against an ostensibly flexible plywood wall. Jessen said it was “one of the most” effective techniques they used and claimed it did not cause pain.“It’s discombobulating. It doesn’t hurt you, but it jostles the inner ear, it makes a really loud noise,” he said.Jessen also described sleep deprivation, a technique in which “the detainee has handcuffs and they’re attached to the tether in a way that they can’t lie down or rest against a wall.”Salim said the pain he experienced from that technique was excruciating: “A lot of pain in my arms, a lot of pains in my back and around my waist.”Mitchell and Jessen said they wanted to stop or limit the use of waterboarding, but the CIA supervisors bullied them into continuing the program.When those at the prison wanted to end the waterboarding sessions as no longer useful, C.I.A. supervisors — including Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the agency’s Counterterrorism Center and a witness who testified under oath in the lawsuit — ordered them to continue. “They kept telling me every day a nuclear bomb was going to be exploded in the United States and that because I had told them to stop, I had lost my nerve and it was going to be my fault if I didn’t continue,” Dr. Jessen testified. Dr. Mitchell said that the C.I.A. officials told them: “‘You guys have lost your spine.’ I think the word that was actually used is that you guys are pussies. There was going to be another attack in America and the blood of dead civilians are going to be on your hands.”Jessen and Mitchell argued that the CIA controlled the program and that they simply worked as contractors. Under the agency’s guidance, the psychologists said they proposed “enhanced interrogation techniques” and trained other people to use them. Over the course of several years, they received $81 million.Even though Mitchell, one of the defendants, claimed the techniques he and Jessen developed caused no harm, he still encouraged the CIA to destroy video footage the agency had made of the interrogations.He rationalized that decision by saying the videos were too graphic: “I thought they were ugly and they would, you know, potentially endanger our lives by putting our pictures out so that the bad guys could see us.”The destruction of the tapes was central to investigations conducted by the Justice Department. In 2010, the department ruled that it would not file criminal charges over the destruction of the tapes.The case filed by the ACLU on behalf of the three former detainees is scheduled for trial on September 5. But according to Watt at the ACLU, there’s already been some success achieved in having the two psychologists and top CIA officials testify under oath.",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/21/15845896/cia-torture-program-psychologists-testimony-jessen-mitchell,

And yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney argued that choking someone in water to gather needed intelligence is a no brainer and that the MCA covered the White House's fairly robust interrogation program, including this technique. Legislation of this sort is always slippery, and the newspapers and legal blogs are full of disagreements about exactly what the new law means and what its effects will be. But one lasting effect is almost certain: Historically, laws like the Military Commissions Act have powerful corrupting forces on the militaries that use them, making them less able to achieve their ultimate goals.The MCA creates a two-track system for interrogation: CIA interrogators can use painful, physical, enhanced interrogation techniques; military interrogators cannot. But it is only a matter of time before military interrogators will wonder why they are stuck using techniques that are allegedly less effective than the CIA's. Then, they too will start quietly adopting these robust interrogation techniques.Prior to the enactment of the new legislation, the definition of torture, for both military and CIA interrogators, was broad and comprehensive. Torture was defined as an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) on someone in his control. This definition affirmed the definition of torture in the United Nations Convention Against Torture, to which the United States is a signatory.The MCA changed the definition of torture. In clarifying what severe physical or mental pain or suffering meant, it created a new standard: Torture must involve a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, a burn or physical disfigurement of a serious nature, not to include cuts, abrasions or bruises; or significant loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.Every torturer knows death in torture is failure, as is driving your prisoner mad. This is why most torturers around the world avoid techniques that cause serious risk of organ failure, madness, or substantial risk of death. The new U.S. legislation absurdly disqualifies as torture not just the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA, but the vast majority of techniques used by torturers worldwide. Among the CIA's authorized techniques, only choking someone in water comes close to failing to meet this standard, and even this is debatable. The vice president, who endorsed waterboarding in some circumstances, clearly believes it does not, emphasizing yesterday that we don't torture and that he is not the vice president for torture.Is anyone so credulous as to believe that these alternative techniques will remain confined to the CIA interrogators? There is ample cause to believe that the new techniques will seep into other agencies. And by their very nature, these techniques are almost impossible to prove after the fact.New interrogation manuals, recently disseminated by the Pentagon, sharply discourage torture, but it is unlikely that military investigators will ever catch interrogators using these techniques. This is because all of the reported CIA techniques for enhanced interrogation—such as stress positions, waterboarding, and exposure to extreme temperatures—leave no lasting marks on the body. Again, this is not news to U.S. military interrogators. No blood, no foul was the motto of a group of American military interrogators who tortured at Camp Nama, outside Baghdad.It is only a matter of time before new rot sets into the U.S. military, thanks to the new MCA. This is inevitable when you codify a two-track interrogation system. In the 1970s, the Brazilian military had a similar two-track system, and the state had to eliminate its torturers in order to preserve itself. As Brazilian journalist Elio Gaspari observed at the time: Unless everyone in the army participates in torture, you very quickly develop two kinds of soldiers. He called them the combatants, who fight the terrorists with torture, and the bureaucrats, who are committed to preserving the military's everyday functioning and discipline. In Brazil, the day came when the combatant-torturers refused to accept the orders of the bureaucrats and regarded with contempt their peers who were committed to army discipline. The generals eventually concluded that [t]he torturers were going to have to be isolated, marginalized and eliminated, so as to save the Army.And this corruption will not be limited to the military. Two-track interrogation systems have similar corrupting influences in domestic policing, particularly as former interrogators and MPs seek jobs as police officers after being decommissioned. The military tortures in the Franco-Algerian War soon seeped into French policing in the 1960s. And in the United States, this kind of slippage has happened twice: initially, as the water tortures of the Spanish-American War began appearing in police stations in the 1920s, and again as electrical techniques used during the Vietnam War appeared in Chicago policing in the 1970s. These torturers-turned-policemen-turned-torturers were especially attracted to techniques that were clean, and there is every reason to believe that the clean techniques now approved in the Iraq war will, sooner or later, appear in a neighborhood near you.The nasty thing about clean torture techniques—and especially the six reportedly approved CIA techniques: the attention grab, the attention slap, the belly slap, the cold room, forced standing, and waterboarding—is that no one can tell how much pain the subject is in as the torture is done. And after the fact, victims have nothing to show to their communities or even to their families—who want to believe them.Japan's fascist military police, the Kempeitai, routinely used hard slapping in the interrogation and punishment of Allied prisoners of war. There can be few Allied prisoners of war, wrote Lord Russell of Liverpool, who were not at some time slapped, adding that a Japanese slap was something to remember. The pain and humiliation, he said, were intense. Few Allied prisoners would have been inclined to be forgiving when, in 1946, Prime Minister Tojo humbly apologized to the Allies for this particular form of torture.Which brings us to the most notorious torture: waterboarding, or choking someone in water. In 1968, a soldier in the 1st Cavalry Division was court-martialed for waterboarding a prisoner in Vietnam. In fact, the practice was identified as a crime as early as 1901, when the Army judge advocate general court-martialed Maj. Edwin Glenn of the 5th U.S. Infantry for waterboarding, a technique he did not hesitate to call torture.That military judge went further, anticipating (and then dismissing) a key justification President Bush and his allies use for torture today. The judge said that the defense of needing to obtain information through torture falls completely, even when at war with a savage or semi-civilized enemy who conducts his operations in violation of the rules of civilized war.

Peter King (R-N.Y.)’ has never exactly been a meek wallflower. But just over the last few months, the New York Republican seems to have taken an alarming turn.Rep. Peter King says the 525-page Senate report on the CIA’s interrogation and detention techniques does not detail torture, but instead just procedures which create what King described as “tremendous discomfort.” Speaking with both local radio and NewsMaxTV’s America’s Forum Wednesday, the New York Republican added it would be a crime if we didn’t take these actions and that those who support the release of the Senate’s scathing report have an attitude of “hate America first,” “self-loathing,” and “self-hatred.”In one of the interviews, King said of waterboarding and related abuses, “I don’t believe these are torture at all… We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that. We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this.”I’ve seen a lot of Republicans this week express support for torture. Pete King’s absurdities are arguably the most depressing.Rectal feeding and hydration were forced on detainees without medical need. According to the CIA’s own records, the report found, one detainee’s lunch tray, “consisting of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused.”Now, either Peter King knows about this and doesn’t consider it torture, or Peter King is popping off from a position of profound ignorance. Either way, perhaps he can spare us the “hate America first” garbage.“According from today’s report, in November 2002, CIA Officer One ordered that the prisoner be shackled to the wall of his cell in a position that required the detainee to rest on the bare concrete floor. The man was wearing only a sweatshirt as the CIA officer had ordered that the rest of his clothing be removed when he had been judged to be uncooperative during an earlier interrogation. “The next day, the guards found the man’s dead body. An internal CIA review and autopsy assessed that he likely died from hyperthermia. They must found the dead body still shackled to the wall – still mostly naked.”Peter King and I probably disagree on quite a bit, but I’m going to hope we can agree that death constitutes a “lasting injury.”Given his recent antics, it’s probably too much to hope that Congressman King will take a long look in the mirror, coming to terms with his own standards of decency and morality, but given his reaction to the torture report, it would appear such reflection is both necessary and overdue.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/peter-king-defends-torture-prisoners-awkward-positions,

It creates tremendous, discomfort there’s no doubt about it. It creates tremendous fear.

In December 2003, a CIA station chief in a country the report does not identify said: “We have made an unsettling discovery that we are holding a number of detainees about whom we know very little.” Most of the prisoners had not been questioned for months.",The Torture Report Info The Mainstream Committed Treason By Helping To Cover Up - Truth Frequency Radio,"There are so many incredible things in the CIA Torture Report that will be discussed and analyzed over the next few weeks and months. But one that stands out to me is that the architects of the torture program were not only wholly unqualified to design it, but they profited massively from the program, to the tune of at least $81 million. And that number may go up, as they also are getting paid by the government for any legal issues related to the program, including over $1 million for legal fees associated with responding to the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation that resulted in this report.The report uses pseudonyms for the two psychologists: Grayson Swigert and Hammond Dunbar. However, their names were actually revealed back in 2007: James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen. To say they were unqualified for the work of designing the torture program would be an understatement. While they were psychologists with the US Air Force’s “Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape” (SERE) program (which is supposed to help train US military personnel in case they’re captured), you’d think they’d actually have some relevant background with terrorism and/or interrogation. But, nope:Instead, their only real experience with interrogation was in reading reports on how to resist the kind of torture programs used by those who failed to follow the Geneva Conventions. Their limited experience with interrogation revolved almost entirely on pure torture programs that did not follow the Geneva Conventions:SERE training is intended to be used to teach our soldiers how to resist interrogation by enemies that refuse to follow the Geneva Conventions and international law. In SERE school, our troops who are at risk of capture are exposed in a controlled environment with great protections and caution — to techniques adapted from abusive tactics used against American soldiers by enemies such as the Communist Chinese during the Korean War. SERE training techniques include stress positions, forced nudity, use of fear, sleep deprivation and, until recently, the Navy SERE school used the waterboard. These techniques were designed to give our students a taste of what they might be subjected to if captured by a ruthless, lawless enemy so that they would be better prepared to resist. The techniques were never intended to be used against detainees in U.S. custody.In other words, their knowledge of interrogation came solely from knowing a little about torture programs used by countries who didn’t follow the Geneva Conventions, and their role had been to try to help US soldiers resist such techniques should they come up. Instead, they turned it around and told the CIA to do almost everything that they flat out knew were torture programs in violation of the Geneva Conventions.The psychologists — initially led by the pseudonymous “Swigert” — were the key to initially torturing Abu Zubadayah. According to the report, the CIA initially planned to see if Zubadayah would provide information through more standard interrogation techniques, leaving a “hard approach… only as a last resort.” In discussing this, someone suggested bringing in Swigert for help — and almost immediately the plans changed.Remember, Swigert had apparently recently reviewed some “research” on “learned helplessness,” and suddenly the CIA’s interrogation plan changed. An FBI message at the time shows exasperation over this, noting that the FBI’s more traditional interrogation techniques had been working in getting relevant information, but as soon as the CIA’s chosen psychologists showed up, they went straight to torture, and blocked the FBI out of the process. Here’s part of an FBI agent’s message back to FBI headquarters:“AZ’s health has improved over the last two days and Agency[CIA]is ready to move [Abu Zubaydah] out of the hospital and back toUH^^Ion in an elaborate plan to change AZ’s environment. Agency [CIA] advised this day that they will be immediately changing tactics in all future AZ interviews by having only there [sic] [CIA officer] interact with AZ (there will be no FBI presence in interview room). This change contradicts all conversations had to date…. They believe AZ is offering, ‘throw away information’ and holding back from providing threat information (It should be note [sic] that we have obtained critical information regarding AZ thus far and have now got him speaking about threat information, albeit from his hospital bed and not [an] appropriate interview environment for full follow-up (due to his health). Suddenly the psychiatric team here wants AZ to only interact with their [CIA officer, and the CIA sees this] as being the best way to get the threat information…. We offered several compromise solutions… all suggestions were immediately declined without further discussion. .. .This again is quite odd as all information obtained from AZ has come from FBI lead interviewers and questioning…. I have spent an un-calculable amount of hours at [Abu Zubaydah’s] bedside assisting with medical help, holding his hand and comforting hum through various medical procedures, even assisting him in going [to] the batliroom…. We have built tremendous report [sic] with AZ and now that we are on the eve of ‘regular” interviews to get threat information, we have been ‘written out’ of future interviews.That was just the beginning. “Swigert” became a key cog in pushing for ever greater torture techniques:You’d think that this sort of lack of experience would be a concern. But, to the CIA, apparently, it was seen as an advantage. A footnote quoting the CIA’s response discusses this:The Senate report points follows this up by pointing out that these psychologists were the key to convincing the CIA to adopt the ruthless torture plans:In fact, it soon reached the point at which the only people allowed to have contact with Abu Zubadayah were… Swigert and Dunbar, the two psychologists who (remember) had no experience with interrogations and little to no background on Al’Qaeda.The report notes, not surprisingly, that this plan to torture Abu Zubadayah produced no useful intelligence (not that it would be okay if it had… but just pointing it out). However, the CIA then let the two psychologists review the success of the program themselves. Guess what they found?Got that? They said it was a success because the torture turned up nothing of value, and thus it proved he had no valuable information to provide. Thus, it should become the model for “future interrogations.” And it did. The same cable, again, authored by those two psychologists, set themselves up to continue being torturers-for-hire:And, indeed, they were used again. And again.This was just the beginning, but once they were in, they were in. Despite a few attempts by some in the CIA to raise concerns about these two, they became the go to guys for both torture techniques and in evaluating those very same torture techniques. And they made a shitload of money.CIA contractors SWIGERT and DUNBAR, who played a central role in the development of the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques in the summer of 2002, and then used the techniques as contract interrogators, formed a company in 2005 [Company Y]. In addition to providing interrogators for the CIA’s interrogation program, Company Y was granted a sole source contract to provide operational psychologists, debriefers, and security personnel at CIA detention sites. Under the contract. Company Y was tasked with conducting ongoing conversations with CIA detainees to learn about the terrorist mind set (this project was named the “Terrorist Think Tank” or “T3“), developing [REDACTED] strategies, and writing the history of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program. Later descriptions of their services note that—on behalf of the CIA—Company Y officers participated in the interrogations of detainees held in foreign government custody and served as intermediaries between entities of those governments and the CIA. By 2006, the value of the base contract for their company, with all options exercised, was in excess of $180 million. As of May 2007, Company Y had hired [X] former CIA staff officers, many of whom had previously been involved with the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program…. The CIA’s contract with Company Y was terminated in mid-2009. From the time of the company’s creation in 2005 through the close-out of its contract in 2010, the CIA paid Company Y more than $75 million for services in conjunction with the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program…. In 2008, the CIA authorized an additional payment to Company Y of approximately $570,000, after Company Y indicated that it had incurred costs for conducting countersurveillance of its officers when appeared in the press in conjunction with the program. The CIA agreed to a $5 million indemnification contract for the company that covered, among other expenses, criminal prosecution. Company Y hired a prominent [REDACTED] law firm for representation in 2007, and billed the CIA $1.1 million for legal expenses from 2007 through 2012 per its indemnification agreement. Part of these expenses included legal presentation at a Committee staff briefing by SWIGERT and DUNBAR on November [XX], 2008. Under the CIA’s indemnification contract, the CIA is obligated to pay Company Y’s legal expenses through 2021.Reading the details of the report, it certainly feels like James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen deserve a place in history alongside other infamous torturers. And yet, instead, they’re free and have banked many millions of dollars — and Mitchell now spends his retirement kayaking in Florida. It’s downright sickening.",http://tfrlive.com/the-torture-report-info-the-mainstream-committed-treason-by-helping-to-cover-up/,

Some politicians and pundits have said that the program has long since ended, and should be relegated to the dustbin of history. But the effects of torture remain seared into the victims' bodies and minds – even if virtually no one in the U.S. ever sees those scars firsthand.On various reporting trips to Guantanamo Bay, I've seen, in a small way, the lasting effect that torture has had on at least one person. Mustafa Hawsawi is one of the five co-defendants in the 9/11 case currently in the pre-trial phase at Guantanamo Bay, and when he appears before court there he sits on a pillow. Many observers assumed that was related to the torture he suffered while held at a CIA black site, but we never had the details.Now we do, and they are gruesome. Following what the report refers to as ""allegations that rectal exams were carried out with 'excessive force,'"" the ""CIA records indicate that one of the detainees, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse."" Numerous other detainees were also subjected to ""rectal rehydration"" and ""rectal feeding"" as a ""means of behavior control."" Attorney Walter Ruiz represents Hawsawi before the military commission at Guantanamo, and, like many Americans, was shocked at the brutality described in the report. In a phone interview with Rolling Stone, he described his reactions to the treatment his client suffered and continues to be plagued by. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length. A spokesperson for the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has not responded to a request for comment. What is your reaction to the torture that your client suffered, as laid out in the report?I was shocked, in a way – even though I already had some knowledge of the facts. The manner in which it was described, and some of the language that was used in those cables and emails, just made it even more horrible. It was so callous. Particularly, there was that one comment about the food tray. [Ruiz is referencing a line in the report that reads: ""Majid Khan's 'lunch tray,' consisting of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was 'pureed' and rectally infused.""] Clearly that conduct would be considered war crimes. And even I didn't have the full extent of those details.Were you aware of your client's rectal prolapse as a result of CIA torture?I knew about his medical issues. You've seen him sitting in court on that pillow. He's had this very painful and chronic condition ever since I've represented him, but I never really understood what precipitated that. And I think part of that is it's so difficult to talk about that. Even though I have a relationship that spans over five years with Mr Hawsawi, we've never discussed such specific and graphic details. I've talked with him a little bit [since the release], and I haven't had a chance to go through the entire report with him, but it's clear this is what happened to him. I think he'd been too embarrassed to discuss it fully. That's shocking.Could Hawsawi have told you about the torture he underwent if he felt comfortable?There were no restrictions on him telling me about the extent of his torture. He has discussed certain aspects of the torture he underwent, but he had not gone into graphic detail about the rough rectal examinations. And my read of that is – I mean, we call that sodomy. That's the equivalent of sodomizing someone. When you piece together the report and look at the different comments that were made – one comment was that they used the largest tube they could find – it's not surprising he would not talk openly about something so horrific. It's not uncommon for victims of crime not to talk about the most gruesome details of their victimization. So while we have talked about torture, and we have talked about some of the things referenced in this report – you saw sections where they talked about the water dousing technique. The CIA's position is that wasn't actually waterboarding, despite the fact that there was a waterboard, and buckets, and solution that were in the facility. That's no surprise to me. And I'm aware of some other issues that are not in the report, and that's probably because they weren't referenced in cables or documented by the CIA. Those, I definitely can't talk about. I'm aware of other instances of torture, but I can't tell you about them because they haven't been declassified. Mustafa Ahmad al-HawsawiMustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi APDo you think the release of this report means you'll be able to further discuss your client's torture in public?Well, the report is unclassified, so anything in the report we can talk about. But right now the guidance remains the same. As it stands, he could not communicate or elaborate on those details that you've seen in the Senate report. Or, for that matter, go to a human rights commission court and seek some redress or accountability. By the same token, I don't think I can discuss with you what Mr Hawsawi had to specifically say about the facts [in the report]. We're still very much in the dark when it comes to what guidance we follow and what it is that we can say. I was in one way surprised by the amount of detail the report did include, because based on the rules we've been laboring under, Mr Hawsawi and I would not have been able to say that to you.And we don't have the entire report. This is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, and Senator Feinstein said in her comments yesterday that this was just a brief sample, that there are more details in that 6,000-page investigation. So we're going to continue to press for the release of that information to us, at least. I expect that report will yield even more gruesome details – if it can get any worse.Part of the government's case against your client is that he helped facilitate 9/11 through money transfers. What do you make of the quote in the report that Hawsawi ""doesn't appear to be a financial mastermind""?You've heard me say that in one way or another many times. I've always tried to communicate the fact that Mr Hawsawi's role was overplayed. For me it just affirms what we've known privately, and tried to communicate publicly. But of course, I'm his lawyer, his advocate, and so that's what people expect me to do. This just confirms that from an independent source.Is your client getting adequate care now for his medical condition?It has never been appropriately addressed. He hasn't had the appropriate doctors or medications with which to do that. It hasn't received the attention it should have received. Mr Hawsawi was [recently] involved in an incident where he was the victim of a rough take-down, where at least eight guards threw him down on the ground when he was shackled. He's down to 117 pounds, he's not eating, so we're very concerned about his medical condition. But the policies in place at Guantanamo prohibit us from speaking to the doctors, or the doctors speaking to us. We need to remedy at least that much. If nothing else, they should provide him the adequate medical treatment to relieve that. And I can tell you now, that's one of many reasons he won't come and sit in court all day. That affects his defense.Does he have other lasting physical ailments?This is the most significant one. He also has a condition in his neck. And I can't tie that into why that specifically is, but I think it's a lasting result of the treatment he's undergone.",http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/cia-torture-detainees-lawyer-decries-war-crimes-20141210,
Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from the CIA interrogation program.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/15/peter-king/peter-king-says-senate-cia-report-found-detainees-/,False,Unrelated,Can not judge,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,The Dark Art of Interrogation,"Here was the biggest catch yet in the war on terror. Sheikh Mohammed is considered the architect of two attempts on the World Trade Center: the one that failed, in 1993, and the one that succeeded so catastrophically, eight years later. He is also believed to have been behind the attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and on the USS Cole two years later, and behind the slaughter last year of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, among other things. An intimate of Osama bin Laden's, Sheikh Mohammed has been called the operations chief of al-Qaeda, if such a formal role can be said to exist in such an informal organization. Others have suggested that an apter designation might be al-Qaeda's chief franchisee. Whatever the analogy, he is one of the terror organization's most important figures, a burly, distinctly modern, cosmopolitan thirty-seven-year-old man fanatically devoted to a medieval form of Islam. He was born to Pakistani parents, raised in Kuwait, and educated in North Carolina to be an engineer before he returned to the Middle East to build a career of bloody mayhem.On what may or may not have been a Saturday, on what may have been March 1, in a house in this city that may have been this squat two-story white one belonging to Ahmad Abdul Qadoos, with big gray-headed crows barking in the front yard, the notorious terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was roughly awakened by a raiding party of Pakistani and American commandos. Anticipating a gunfight, they entered loud and fast. Instead they found him asleep. He was pulled from his bed, hooded, bound, hustled from the house, placed in a vehicle, and driven quickly away.Sheikh Mohammed is a smart man. There is an anxious, searching quality to his expression in that first post-arrest photo. It is the look of a man awakened into nightmare. Everything that has given his life meaning, his role as husband and father, his leadership, his stature, plans, and ambitions, is finished. His future is months, maybe years, of imprisonment and interrogation; a military tribunal; and almost certain execution. You can practically see the wheels turning in his head, processing his terminal predicament. How will he spend his last months and years? Will he maintain a dignified, defiant silence? Or will he succumb to his enemy and betray his friends, his cause, and his faith?Some say that Sheikh Mohammed was captured months before the March 1 date announced by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Abdul Qadoos, a pale, white-bearded alderman in this well-heeled neighborhood, told me that Sheikh Mohammed was not there then or ever. The official video of the takedown appears to have been faked. But the details are of minor importance. Whenever, wherever, and however it happened, nearly everyone now agrees that Sheikh Mohammed is in U.S. custody, and has been for some time. In the first hours of his captivity the hood came off and a picture was taken. It shows a bleary-eyed, heavy, hairy, swarthy man with a full black moustache, thick eyebrows, a dark outline of beard on a rounded, shaved face, three chins, long sideburns, and a full head of dense, long, wildly mussed black hair. He stands before a pale tan wall whose paint is chipped, leaning slightly forward, like a man with his hands bound behind him, the low cut of his loose-fitting white T-shirt exposing matted curls of hair on his chest, shoulders, and back. He is looking down and to the right of the camera. He appears dazed and glum.Playing an American surrogate won't help you or your country, he said. There are dozens of people like me who will give their lives but won't let the Americans live in peace anywhere in the world. Asked if Osama bin Laden was alive, he said, Of course he is alive. He spoke of meeting with bin Laden in a mountainous border region in December. He seemed smug about U.S. and British preparations for war against Saddam Hussein. Let the Iraq War begin, he said. The U.S. forces will be targeted inside their bases in the Gulf. I don't have any specific information, but my sixth sense is telling me that you will get the news from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait. Indeed, in the following months al-Qaeda carried out a murderous attack in Saudi Arabia.If Sheikh Mohammed felt despair in those first hours, it didn't show. According to a Pakistani officer who sat in on an initial ISI questioning, the al-Qaeda sub-boss seemed calm and stoic. For his first two days in custody he said nothing beyond confirming his name. A CIA official says that Sheikh Mohammed spent those days sitting in a trancelike state and reciting verses from the Koran. On the third day he is said to have loosened up. Fluent in the local languages of Urdu, Pashto, and Baluchi, he tried to shame his Pakistani interrogators, lecturing them on their responsibilities as Muslims and upbraiding them for cooperating with infidels.Intelligence and military officials would talk about Sheikh Mohammed's state only indirectly, and conditionally. But by the time he arrived at a more permanent facility, he would already have been bone-tired, hungry, sore, uncomfortable, and afraid—if not for himself, then for his wife and children, who had been arrested either with him or some months before, depending on which story you believe. He would have been warned that lack of cooperation might mean being turned over to the more direct and brutal interrogators of some third nation. He would most likely have been locked naked in a cell with no trace of daylight. The space would be filled night and day with harsh light and noise, and would be so small that he would be unable to stand upright, to sit comfortably, or to recline fully. He would be kept awake, cold, and probably wet. If he managed to doze, he would be roughly awakened. He would be fed infrequently and irregularly, and then only with thin, tasteless meals. Sometimes days would go by between periods of questioning, sometimes only hours or minutes. The human mind craves routine, and can adjust to almost anything in the presence of it, so his jailers would take care that no semblance of routine developed.On that third day, once more hooded, Sheikh Mohammed was driven to Chaklala Air Force base, in Rawalpindi, and turned over to U.S. forces. From there he was flown to the CIA interrogation center in Bagram, Afghanistan, and from there, some days later, to an undisclosed location (a place the CIA calls Hotel California)—presumably a facility in another cooperative nation, or perhaps a specially designed prison aboard an aircraft carrier. It doesn't much matter where, because the place would not have been familiar or identifiable to him. Place and time, the anchors of sanity, were about to come unmoored. He might as well have been entering a new dimension, a strange new world where his every word, move, and sensation would be monitored and measured; where things might be as they seemed but might not; where there would be no such thing as day or night, or normal patterns of eating and drinking, wakefulness and sleep; where hot and cold, wet and dry, clean and dirty, truth and lies, would all be tangled and distorted.Deprived of any outside information, Sheikh Mohammed would grow more and more vulnerable to manipulation. For instance, intelligence gleaned after successful al-Qaeda attacks in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia might be fed to him, in bits and pieces, so as to suggest foiled operations. During questioning he would be startled regularly by details about his secret organization—details drawn from ongoing intelligence operations, new arrests, or the interrogation of other captive al-Qaeda members. Some of the information fed to him would be true, some of it false. Key associates might be said to be cooperating, or to have completely recanted their allegiance to jihad . As time went by, his knowledge would decay while that of his questioners improved. He might come to see once-vital plans as insignificant, or already known. The importance of certain secrets would gradually erode.Questioning would be intense—sometimes loud and rough, sometimes quiet and friendly, with no apparent reason for either. He would be questioned sometimes by one person, sometimes by two or three. The session might last for days, with interrogators taking turns, or it might last only a few minutes. He would be asked the same questions again and again, and then suddenly be presented with something completely unexpected—a detail or a secret that he would be shocked to find they knew. He would be offered the opportunity to earn freedom or better treatment for his wife and children. Whenever he was helpful and the information he gave proved true, his harsh conditions would ease. If the information proved false, his treatment would worsen. On occasion he might be given a drug to elevate his mood prior to interrogation; marijuana, heroin, and sodium pentothal have been shown to overcome a reluctance to speak, and methamphetamine can unleash a torrent of talk in the stubbornest subjects, the very urgency of the chatter making a complex lie impossible to sustain. These drugs could be administered surreptitiously with food or drink, and given the bleakness of his existence, they might even offer a brief period of relief and pleasure, thereby creating a whole new category of longing—and new leverage for his interrogators.Torture is repulsive. It is deliberate cruelty, a crude and ancient tool of political oppression. It is commonly used to terrorize people, or to wring confessions out of suspected criminals who may or may not be guilty. It is the classic shortcut for a lazy or incompetent investigator. Horrifying examples of torturers' handiwork are catalogued and publicized annually by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and other organizations that battle such abuses worldwide. One cannot help sympathizing with the innocent, powerless victims showcased in their literature. But professional terrorists pose a harder question. They are lockboxes containing potentially life-saving information. Sheikh Mohammed has his own political and religious reasons for plotting mass murder, and there are those who would applaud his principled defiance in captivity. But we pay for his silence in blood.We hear a lot these days about America's overpowering military technology; about the professionalism of its warriors; about the sophistication of its weaponry, eavesdropping, and telemetry; but right now the most vital weapon in its arsenal may well be the art of interrogation. To counter an enemy who relies on stealth and surprise, the most valuable tool is information, and often the only source of that information is the enemy himself. Men like Sheikh Mohammed who have been taken alive in this war are classic candidates for the most cunning practices of this dark art. Intellectual, sophisticated, deeply religious, and well trained, they present a perfect challenge for the interrogator. Getting at the information they possess could allow us to thwart major attacks, unravel their organization, and save thousands of lives. They and their situation pose one of the strongest arguments in modern times for the use of torture.The word torture comes from the Latin verb torquere , to twist. Webster's New World Dictionary offers the following primary definition: The inflicting of severe pain to force information and confession, get revenge, etc. Note the adjective severe, which summons up images of the rack, thumbscrews, gouges, branding irons, burning pits, impaling devices, electric shock, and all the other devilish tools devised by human beings to mutilate and inflict pain on others. All manner of innovative cruelty is still commonplace, particularly in Central and South America, Africa, and the Middle East. Saddam Hussein's police force burned various marks into the foreheads of thieves and deserters, and routinely sliced tongues out of those whose words offended the state. In Sri Lanka prisoners are hung upside down and burned with hot irons. In China they are beaten with clubs and shocked with cattle prods. In India the police stick pins through the fingernails and fingers of prisoners. Maiming and physical abuse are legal in Somalia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Sudan, and other countries that practice sharia ; the hands of thieves are lopped off, and women convicted of adultery may be stoned to death. Governments around the world continue to employ rape and mutilation, and to harm family members, including children, in order to extort confessions or information from those in captivity. Civilized people everywhere readily condemn these things.The Geneva Convention makes no distinction: it bans any mistreatment of prisoners. But some nations that are otherwise committed to ending brutality have employed torture lite under what they feel are justifiable circumstances. In 1987 Israel attempted to codify a distinction between torture, which was banned, and moderate physical pressure, which was permitted in special cases. Indeed, some police officers, soldiers, and intelligence agents who abhor severe methods believe that banning all forms of physical pressure would be dangerously naive. Few support the use of physical pressure to extract confessions, especially because victims will often say anything (to the point of falsely incriminating themselves) to put an end to pain. But many veteran interrogators believe that the use of such methods to extract information is justified if it could save lives—whether by forcing an enemy soldier to reveal his army's battlefield positions or forcing terrorists to betray the details of ongoing plots. As these interrogators see it, the well-being of the captive must be weighed against the lives that might be saved by forcing him to talk. A method that produces life-saving information without doing lasting harm to anyone is not just preferable; it appears to be morally sound. Hereafter I will use torture to mean the more severe traditional outrages, and coercion to refer to torture lite, or moderate physical pressure.Then there are methods that, some people argue, fall short of torture. Called torture lite, these include sleep deprivation, exposure to heat or cold, the use of drugs to cause confusion, rough treatment (slapping, shoving, or shaking), forcing a prisoner to stand for days at a time or to sit in uncomfortable positions, and playing on his fears for himself and his family. Although excruciating for the victim, these tactics generally leave no permanent marks and do no lasting physical harm.It is likely that some captured terrorists' names and arrests have not yet been revealed; people may be held for months before their arrests are staged. Once a top-level suspect is publicly known to be in custody, his intelligence value falls. His organization scatters, altering its plans, disguises, cover stories, codes, tactics, and communication methods. The maximum opportunity for intelligence gathering comes in the first hours after an arrest, before others in a group can possibly know that their walls have been breached. Keeping an arrest quiet for days or weeks prolongs this opportunity. If March 1 was in fact the day of Sheikh Mohammed's capture, then the cameras and the headlines were an important intelligence failure. The arrest of the senior al-Qaeda figure Abu Anas Liby, in Sudan in February of 2002, was not made public until a month later, when U.S. efforts to have him transferred to custody in Egypt were leaked to the Sunday Times of London. So, again, there is no exact count of suspected terrorists in custody. In September of last year, testifying before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Cofer Black, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said that the number who have been detained was about 3,000.There is no clear count of suspected terrorists now in U.S. custody. About 680 were detained at Camp X-Ray, the specially constructed prison at Guantánamo, on the southeastern tip of Cuba. Most of these are now considered mere foot soldiers in the Islamist movement, swept up in Afghanistan during the swift rout of the Taliban. They come from forty-two different nations. Scores of other detainees, considered leaders, have been or are being held at various locations around the world: in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, Morocco, Yemen, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and Iraq, where U.S. forces now hold the top echelon of Saddam Hussein's dismembered regime. Some detainees are in disclosed prisons, such as the facility at Bagram and a camp on the island of Diego Garcia. Others—upper-tier figures such as Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rashim al-Nashiri, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Tawfiq bin Attash—are being held at undisclosed locations.Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said in September of last year that interrogation of captured terrorist leaders had yielded an awful lot of information and had made life an awful lot more difficult for an awful lot of folks. Indeed, if press accounts can be believed, these captured Islamist fanatics are all but dismantling their own secret organization. According to published reports, Sheikh Mohammed was found in part because of information from bin al-Shibh, whose arrest had been facilitated by information from Abu Zubaydah. Weeks after the sheikh's capture Bush Administration officials and intelligence experts told The Washington Post that the al-Qaeda deputy's cooperation under interrogation had given them hopes of arresting or killing the rest of the organization's top leadership.All these suspects are questioned rigorously, but those in the top ranks get the full coercive treatment. And if official and unofficial government reports are to be believed, the methods work. In report after report hard-core terrorist leaders are said to be either cooperating or, at the very least, providing some information—not just vague statements but detailed, verifiable, useful intelligence. In late March, Time reported that Sheikh Mohammed had given U.S. interrogators the names and descriptions of about a dozen key al-Qaeda operatives believed to be plotting terrorist attacks on America and other western countries and had added crucial details to the descriptions of other suspects and filled in important gaps in what U.S. intelligence knows about al-Qaeda's practices. In June, news reports suggested that Sheikh Mohammed was discussing operational planning with his captors and had told interrogators that al-Qaeda did not work with Saddam Hussein. And according to a report in June of last year, Abu Zubaydah, who is said to be held in solitary confinement somewhere in Pakistan, provided information that helped foil a plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in the United States.Bill Cowan, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who conducted interrogations in Vietnam, says, I don't see the proof in the pudding. If you had a top leader like Mohammed talking, someone who could presumably lay out the whole organization for you, I think we'd be seeing sweeping arrests in several different countries at the same time. Instead what we see is an arrest here, then a few months later an arrest there.To some, all this jailhouse cooperation smells concocted. I doubt we're getting very much out of them, despite what you read in the press, says a former CIA agent with experience in South America. Everybody in the world knows that if you are arrested by the United States, nothing bad will happen to you.How much of this can be believed? Are such reports wishful thinking, or deliberate misinformation? There is no doubt that intelligence agencies have scored big victories over al-Qaeda in the past two years, but there is no way to corroborate these stories. President Bush himself warned, soon after 9/11, that in war mode his Administration would closely guard intelligence sources and methods. It would make sense to claim that top al-Qaeda leaders had caved under questioning even if they had not. Hard men like Abu Zubaydah, bin al-Shibh, and Sheikh Mohammed are widely admired in parts of the world. Word that they had been broken would demoralize their followers, and would encourage lower-ranking members of their organization to talk; if their leaders had given in, why should they hold out?Is the United States torturing prisoners? Three inmates have died in U.S. custody in Afghanistan, and reportedly eighteen prisoners at Guantánamo have attempted suicide; one prisoner there survived after hanging himself but remains unconscious and is not expected to revive. Shah Muhammad, a twenty-year-old Pakistani who was held at Camp X-Ray for eighteen months, told me that he repeatedly tried to kill himself in despair. They were driving me crazy, he said. Public comments by Administration officials have fueled further suspicion. An unnamed intelligence official told The Wall Street Journal , What's needed is a little bit of smacky-face. Some al-Qaeda just need some extra encouragement. Then there was the bravado of Cofer Black, the counterterrorism coordinator, in his congressional testimony last year. A pudgy, balding, round-faced man with glasses, who had served with the CIA before taking the State Department position, Black refused to testify behind a screen, as others had done. The American people need to see my face, he said. I want to look the American people in the eye. By way of presenting his credentials he said that in 1995 a group of Osama bin Laden's thugs were caught planning to kill me.These complaints are all from people who have no qualms about using torture to get information from men like Sheikh Mohammed. Their concern is that merely using coercion amounts to handling terrorists with kid gloves. But the busts of al-Qaeda cells worldwide, and the continuing roundup of al-Qaeda leaders, suggest that some of those in custody are being made to talk. This worries people who campaign against all forms of torture. They believe that the rules are being ignored. Responding to rumors of mistreatment at Bagram and Guantánamo, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have written letters and met with Bush Administration officials. They haven't been able to learn much.The quest for surefire methods in the art of interrogation has been long, ugly, and generally fruitless. Nazi scientists experimented on concentration-camp inmates, subjecting them to extremes of hot and cold, to drugs, and to raw pain in an effort to see what combination of horrors would induce cooperation. The effort produced a long list of dead and maimed, but no reliable ways of getting people to talk.As we will see, Haynes's choice of words was careful—and telling. The human-rights groups and the Administration are defining terms differently. Yet few would argue that getting Sheikh Mohammed to talk doesn't serve the larger interests of mankind. So before tackling the moral and legal questions raised by interrogation, perhaps the first question should be, What works?In June, at the urging of Amnesty and other groups, President Bush reaffirmed America's opposition to torture, saying, I call on all governments to join with the United States and the community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture ... and we are leading this fight by example. A slightly more detailed response had been prepared two months earlier by the Pentagon's top lawyer, William J. Haynes II, in a letter to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. (My requests for interviews on this subject with the Pentagon, the White House, and the State Department were declined.) Haynes wrote,Describing the clandestine war, Black said, This is a highly classified area. All I want to say is that there was 'before 9/11' and 'after 9/11.' After 9/11 the gloves came off. He was referring to the overall counterterrorism effort, but in the context of detained captives the line was suggestive. A story in December of 2002 by the Washington Post reporters Dana Priest and Barton Gellman described the use of stress and duress techniques at Bagram, and an article in The New York Times in March described the mistreatment of prisoners there. That month Irene Kahn, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, wrote a letter of protest to President Bush.There was a lot of hope for LSD. Discovered by accident in a Swiss pharmaceutical lab in 1943, it produced powerful mind-altering effects in very small doses. It was more powerful than mescaline, which had its own adherents, and could easily be administered without the victim's knowledge, slipped into food or drink. The hope was that an informant in such an artificially open-minded state would lose sight of his goals and sense of loyalty and become putty in the hands of a skilled interrogator. Studies on LSD began at a number of big universities, and as word of the drug's properties spread, it started to attract a broad range of interest. Theologians, scholars, and mental-health workers visited the Maryland Psychiatric Research Institute, just outside Baltimore, to turn on and tune in, and similar programs began in Boston, New York, Chicago, and other cities. Almost twenty years ago I interviewed a number of those who took part in these experiments; all of them were apparently motivated only by professional curiosity. The CIA's role was kept quiet. But the most notorious of its efforts at LSD experimentation involved Frank Olson, an Army scientist who was dosed without his knowledge and subsequently committed suicide. The U.S. Army conducted field tests of LSD as an interrogation tool in 1961 (Operation Third Chance), dosing nine foreigners and an American soldier named James Thornwell, who had been accused of stealing classified documents. Thornwell subsequently sued the government and was awarded $650,000. Most of these efforts led to little more than scandal and embarrassment. The effects of the drug were too wildly unpredictable to make it useful in interrogation. It tended to amplify the sorts of feelings that inhibit cooperation. Fear and anxiety turned into terrifying hallucinations and fantasies, which made it more difficult to elicit secrets, and added a tinge of unreality to whatever information was divulged. LSD may have unlocked the mind in some esoteric sense, but secrets tended to ride out the trip intact.These experiments and others are recorded in detail in John Marks's somewhat overheated book The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control (1979) and in George Andrews's book mkULTRA: The CIA's Top Secret Program in Human Experimentation and Behavior Modification (2001). Andrews summarized information revealed in congressional probes of CIA excesses. Marks was more sensational. In the spirit of the times, he tended to interpret the Agency's interest in behavioral science, hypnosis, and mind-altering drugs as a scheme to create zombie-like secret agents, although it appears that the real goal was to make people talk.In 1953 John Lilly, of the National Institute of Mental Health, discovered that by placing electrodes inside the brain of a monkey, he could stimulate pain, anger, fear—and pleasure. He placed one inside the brain of a male monkey and gave the monkey a switch that would trigger an immediate erection and orgasm. (The monkey hit the switch roughly every three minutes, thus confirming the gender stereotype.) The idea of manipulating a brain from the inside promptly attracted the interest of the CIA, which foresaw, among other things, the possibility of sidestepping a reluctant informant's self-defenses. But Lilly dropped the line of research, pointing out that merely inserting the electrodes caused brain damage.Better results seemed to come from sensory deprivation and solitary confinement. For most people severe sensory deprivation quickly becomes misery; the effects were documented in the notorious 1963 CIA manual on interrogation, called the Kubark Manual. It remains the most comprehensive and detailed explanation in print of coercive methods of questioning—given the official reluctance to discuss these matters or put them in writing, because such things tend to be both politically embarrassing and secret. Treatises on interrogation in the public domain are written primarily for police departments and address the handling of criminal defendants—with all the necessary concern for protecting a defendant's rights. Unearthed in 1997, through the Freedom of Information Act, by the Baltimore Sun reporters Gary Cohn, Ginger Thompson, and Mark Matthews, the Kubark Manual reveals the CIA's insights into the tougher methods employed by the military and intelligence agencies. Much of the practice and theory it details is also found unchanged in the 1983 Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual , usually known as the Honduras Manual— which the CIA had tried to soften with a hasty edit prior to releasing it. The manual was shaken loose at the same time by Cohn and Thompson. And the more summary discussions of technique in later U.S. Army manuals on interrogation, including the most recent, also clearly echo Kubark . If there is a bible of interrogation, it is the Kubark Manual .Experiments were also conducted with heroin and psychedelic mushrooms, neither of which reliably delivered up the secrets of men's souls. Indeed, drugs seemed to enhance some people's ability to be deceptive. Scopolamine held out some early hope, but it often induced hallucinations. Barbiturates were promising, and were already used effectively by psychiatrists to help with therapy. Some researchers advocated electroshock treatments, to, as it were, blast information from a subject's brain. Drugs such as marijuana, alcohol, and sodium pentothal can lower inhibitions, but they do not erase deep-seated convictions. And the more powerful the drug, the less reliable the testimony. According to my intelligence sources, drugs are today sometimes used to assist in critical interrogations, and the preferred ones are methamphetamines tempered with barbiturates and cannabis. These tools can help, but they are only as effective as the interrogator.But these effects didn't trouble everyone. One man's misery is another man's mind-altering experience. Some people found they liked sensory-deprivation tanks; indeed, in later years people would pay for a session in one. Lilly was fond of injecting himself with LSD and then closing himself off in his tank—a series of experiments made famous in the 1980 film Altered States . In Canada a scientist put a fifty-two-year-old woman identified only as Mary C. in a sensory-deprivation chamber for thirty-five days. She never asked to be let out.The manual cites a 1954 study at the National Institute of Mental Health (again led by John Lilly) in which two volunteers attempted to see how long they could stay suspended in water wearing blackout masks and hearing only the sound of their own breathing and some faint sounds of water from the piping. Neither lasted more than three hours. According to the study, Both passed quickly from normally directed thinking through a tension resulting from unsatisfied hunger for sensory stimuli and concentration upon the few available sensations to provide reveries and fantasies and eventually to visual imagery somewhat resembling hallucinations. John Marks reported in his book that in a similar experiment a volunteer kicked his way out of a sensory-deprivation box after an hour of tearful pleas for release had been ignored.Though science has made contributions, interrogation remains more art than science. Like any other subject, Sheikh Mohammed presented his interrogators with a unique problem. The critical hub of a worldwide secret network, he had a potential road map in his head to the whole shadow world of jihad . If he could be made to talk, to reveal even a few secrets, what an intelligence bonanza that would be! Here was a man who lived to further his cause by whatever means, who saw himself as morally, spiritually, and intellectually superior to the entire infidel Western world, a man for whom capitulation meant betraying not just his friends and his cherished cause but his very soul.You want a good interrogator? Jerry Giorgio, the New York Police Department's legendary third-degree man, asks. Give me somebody who people like, and who likes people. Give me somebody who knows how to put people at ease. Because the more comfortable they are, the more they talk, and the more they talk, the more trouble they're in—the harder it is to sustain a lie.The one constant in effective interrogation, it seems, is the interrogator. And some interrogators are just better at it than others.One thing all these experiments made clear was that no matter what drugs or methods were applied, the results varied from person to person. So another major area of inquiry involved trying to define certain broad personality types and discover what methods would work best for each. The groups were ridiculously general—the Kubark Manual lists The Orderly-Obstinate Character, The Greedy-Demanding Character, The Anxious, Self-Centered Character—and the prescriptions for questioning them tended to vary little and were sometimes silly (the advice for questioning an Orderly-Obstinate Character recommends doing so in a room that is especially neat). The categories were useless. Everyone, and every situation, is different; some people begin a day greedy and demanding and end it orderly and obstinate.Fear works. It is more effective than any drug, tactic, or torture device. According to unnamed scientific studies cited by the Kubark Manual (it is frightening to think what these experiments might have been), most people cope with pain better than they think they will. As people become more familiar with pain, they become conditioned to it. Those who have suffered more physical pain than others—from being beaten frequently as a child, for example, or suffering a painful illness—may adapt to it and come to fear it less. So once interrogators resort to actual torture, they are apt to lose ground.It worked like a charm, Cowan told me. The minute the crank started to turn, he was ready to talk. We never had to do more than make it clear we could deliver a jolt. It was the fear more than the pain that made them talk.So when he captured a Vietcong soldier who could warn of ambushes and lead them to hidden troops but who refused to speak, wires were attached to the man's scrotum with alligator clips and electricity was cranked out of a 110-volt generator.Bill Cowan spent three and a half years fighting the war in Vietnam. He was a young Marine captain assigned to the Rung Sat Special Zone, a putrid swamp that begins just south of Saigon. Miles and miles of thick, slurping mud that swallowed soldiers to their waists, it is populated by galaxies of mosquitoes and other biting insects, snakes, crocodiles, and stands of rotting mangrove. It is intersected by the saltwater rivers of the Mekong Delta, and features occasional stretches of flat, open farmland. The Marines knew that several battalions of Vietcong were in the Rung Sat. The enemy would lie low, building strength, and then launch surprise attacks on South Vietnamese or U.S. troops. The soldiers in Cowan's unit played cat-and-mouse with an enemy that melted away at their approach.I'll tell you how to make a man talk, a retired Special Forces officer says. You shoot the man to his left and the man to his right. Then you can't shut him up.By similar logic, the manual discourages threatening a prisoner with death. As a tactic it is often found to be worse than useless, the manual says, because the sense of despair it induces can make the prisoner withdraw into depression—or, in some cases, see an honorable way out of his predicament.Furthermore, if a prisoner is subjected to pain after other methods have failed, it is a signal that the interrogation process may be nearing an end. He may then decide that if he can just hold out against this final assault, he will win the struggle and his freedom, the manual concludes. Even if severe pain does elicit information, it can be false, which is particularly troublesome to interrogators seeking intelligence rather than a confession. Much useful information is time-sensitive, and running down false leads or arresting innocents wastes time.He was sent back to his hammock to think things over. Dunn had never considered himself a superaggressive soldier, a warrior type, and had never imagined himself in such a situation. His training for captivity had been basic. He had been instructed to tell his captors only his name, rank, and serial number. Anything beyond that was considered a breach of duty—a betrayal of his country, his role as a soldier, and his personal honor. Faced with death, Dunn weighed his devotion to this simple code. He felt it was unrealistic. He wrestled to come up with a solution that would keep him alive without completely compromising his dignity. He figured there were certain details about his life and service that were not worth dying to protect. Some things needed to be kept secret, and others did not. Struggling with shame, he decided to answer any questions that did not intrude on that closed center of secrecy. He would not tell them he was an intelligence officer. (Not out of patriotism, he says. Out of fear, strictly self-preservation.) He would not reveal accurate details about fortifications around his company's headquarters, in Di Linh. He would not tell them about upcoming plans, such as the Phoenix Program (an assassination program targeting Vietcong village leaders), and above all, he would not make any public statements. But he would talk. The threat of execution in his case was not worse than useless. It shook Dunn to his core.John Dunn found the truth to be a little more complicated. In his case the threat of execution forced him to bend but not break. He was a U.S. Army intelligence officer in the Lam Dong Province of Vietnam, in March of 1968, when he was captured by the Vietcong. He and other captives were marched for weeks to a prison camp in the jungle, where initially he was treated quite well. The gentle treatment lulled him, Dunn says, and contributed to his shock when, in his first interrogation session, he was calmly told, We don't need you. We did not sign the Geneva Convention, and you are not considered a prisoner of war anyway. You are a war criminal. If you don't cooperate with us, you will be executed.In a subsequent session he talked, but not enough to satisfy his captors. Again and again he refused to make a public statement. Starved, sore, and still frightened, Dunn was told, You will be executed. After dark.When the sun set, the interrogator, his aide, and the camp commander came for Dunn with a group of soldiers. They unlocked his chain, and he carried it as they led him away from the encampment into the jungle. They stopped in front of a pit they had dug for his grave and put a gun to his head. The interrogator gave him one more chance to agree to make a statement.No, Dunn said. He had gone as far as he was willing to go.Why do you want to die? he was asked.If I must, I must, Dunn said. He felt resigned. He waited to be killed.You will not be executed, the camp commander said abruptly, and that was that.Judging by Dunn's experience, the threat of death may be valuable to an interrogator as a way of loosening up a determined subject. But, as with pain, the most important factor is fear. An unfrightened prisoner makes an unlikely informer.If there is an archetype of the modern interrogator, it is Michael Koubi. The former chief interrogator for Israel's General Security Services, or Shabak, Koubi probably has more experience than anyone else in the world in the interrogation of hostile Arab prisoners, some of them confirmed terrorists and religious fanatics—men, he says, whose hatred of the Jews is unbridgeable. He has blue eyes in a crooked face: time, the greatest caricaturist of all, has been at work on it for more than sixty years, and has produced one that is lean, browned, deeply lined, and naturally concave. His considerable nose has been broken twice, and now ends well to the right of where it begins, giving him a look that is literally off-center. His wisdom, too, is slightly off-center, because Koubi has been given a uniquely twisted perspective on human nature. For decades he has been experimenting with captive human beings, cajoling, tricking, hurting, threatening, and spying on them, steadily upping the pressure, looking for cracks at the seams.I met Koubi at his home on the beach in Ashkelon, just a short drive north of the border with the Gaza Strip, in whose prisons he worked for much of his career. He is comfortably retired from his Shabak job now, a grandfather three times over, and works for the municipal Inspection and Sanitation Department. There are still many things he is not free to discuss, but he is happy to talk about his methods. He is very proud of his skills, among them an ability to speak Arabic so fluently that he can adopt a multitude of colloquial flavors. Koubi came to his career as an interrogator through his love of language. He grew up speaking Hebrew, Yiddish, and Arabic, and he studied Arabic in high school, working to master its idiom and slang. He also had a knack for reading the body language and facial expressions of his subjects, and for sensing a lie. He is a skilled actor who could alternately befriend or intimidate a subject, sometimes turning on a dime. Blending these skills with the tricks he had learned over the years for manipulating people, Koubi didn't just question his subjects, he orchestrated their emotional surrender.To many, including many in Israel, Koubi and the unit he headed are an outrage. The games they played and the tactics they employed are seen as inhumane, illegal, and downright evil. It is hard to picture this pleasant grandfather as the leader of a unit that critics accuse of being brutal; but then, charm has always been as important to interrogation work as toughness or cruelty—perhaps more important. Koubi says that only in rare instances did he use force to extract information from his subjects; in most cases it wasn't necessary.People change when they get to prison, Koubi says. They may be heroes outside, but inside they change. The conditions are different. People are afraid of the unknown. They are afraid of being tortured, of being held for a long time. Try to see what it is like to sit with a hood over your head for four hours, when you are hungry and tired and afraid, when you are isolated from everything and have no clue what is going on. When the captive believes that anything could happen—torture, execution, indefinite imprisonment, even the persecution of his loved ones—the interrogator can go to work.Under pressure, he says, nearly everyone looks out first and foremost for No. 1. What's more, a very large part of who a man is depends on his circumstances. No matter who he is before his arrest, his sense of self will blur in custody. Isolation, fear, and deprivation force a man to retreat, to reorient himself, and to reorder his priorities. For most men, Koubi says, the hierarchy of loyalty under stress is 1) self, 2) group, 3) family, 4) friends. In other words, even the most dedicated terrorist (with very rare exceptions), when pushed hard enough, will act to preserve and protect himself at the expense of anyone or anything else. There's an old Arab saying, Koubi says. 'Let one hundred mothers cry, but not my mother—but better my mother than me.'With older men the priorities shift slightly. In middle age the family often overtakes the group (the cause) to become the second most important loyalty. Young men tend to be fiercely committed and ambitious, but older men—even men with deeply held convictions, men admired and emulated by their followers—tend to have loves and obligations that count for more. Age frays idealism, slackens zeal, and cools ferocity. Abstractions lose ground to wife, children, and grandchildren. Notice that the leaders of Hamas do not send their own sons and daughters, and their own grandchildren, to blow themselves up, Koubi says.So it is often the top-level men, like Sheikh Mohammed, who are easier to crack. Koubi believes that having the al-Qaeda leader's wife and children in custody gives his interrogators powerful leverage. The key is to find a man's weak point and exploit it.For Koubi the three critical ingredients of that process are preparation, investigation, and theater.Preparing a subject for interrogation means softening him up. Ideally, he has been pulled from his sleep—like Sheikh Mohammed—early in the morning, roughly handled, bound, hooded (a coarse, dirty, smelly sack serves the purpose perfectly), and kept waiting in discomfort, perhaps naked in a cold, wet room, forced to stand or to sit in an uncomfortable position. He may be kept awake for days prior to questioning, isolated and ill-fed. He may be unsure where he is, what time of day it is, how long he has been or will be held. If he is wounded, as Abu Zubaydah was, pain medication may be withheld; it is one thing to cause pain, another to refuse to relieve it.Mousa Khoury, a Palestinian businessman, knows the drill all too well. A slender thirty-four-year-old man with a black goatee and thinning hair, he is bitter about the Israeli occupation and his experiences in custody. He has been arrested and interrogated six times by Israeli forces. He was once held for seventy-one days.My hands were cuffed behind my back, and a potato sack was over my head, he says. My legs were cuffed to a tiny chair. The chair's base is ten centimeters by twenty centimeters. The back is ten centimeters by ten centimeters. It is hard wood. The front legs are shorter than the back ones, so you are forced to slide forward in it, only your hands are bound in the back. If you sit back, the back of the chair digs into the small of your back. If you slump forward, you are forced to hang by your hands. It is painful. They will take you to the toilet only after screaming a request one hundred times. He could think about only one thing: how to make the treatment stop. Your thoughts go back and forth and back and forth, and you can no longer have a normal stream of consciousness, he says.Preparing an interrogator means arming him beforehand with every scrap of information about his subject. U.S. Army interrogation manuals suggest preparing a thick dummy file when little is known, to make it appear that the interrogator knows more than he does. Nothing rattles a captive more than to be confronted with a fact he thought was secret or obscure. It makes the interrogator seem powerful, all-knowing. A man's sense of importance is wounded, and he is slower to lie, because he thinks he might be caught at it. There are many ways that scraps of information—gathered by old-fashioned legwork or the interrogation of a subject's associates—can be leveraged by a clever interrogator into something new. Those scraps might be as simple as knowing the names of a man's siblings or key associates, the name of his girlfriend, or a word or phrase that has special meaning to his group. Uncovering privileged details diminishes the aura of a secret society, whether it is a social club, a terrorist cell, or a military unit. Joining such a group makes an individual feel distinct, important, and superior, and invests even the most mundane of his activities with meaning. An interrogator who penetrates that secret society, unraveling its shared language, culture, history, customs, plans, and pecking order, can diminish its hold on even the staunchest believer. Suspicion that a trusted comrade has betrayed the group—or the subject himself—undermines the sense of a secretly shared purpose and destiny. Armed with a few critical details, a skilled interrogator can make a subject doubt the value of information he has been determined to withhold. It is one thing to suffer in order to protect a secret, quite another to cling to a secret that is already out. This is how a well-briefed interrogator breaches a group's defenses.Koubi believes that the most important skill for an interrogator is to know the prisoner's language. Working through interpreters is at best a necessary evil. Language is at the root of all social connections, and plays a critical role in secret societies like Hamas and al-Qaeda. A shared vocabulary or verbal shorthand helps to cement the group.I try to create the impression that I use his mother tongue even better than he does, Koubi says. No accent, no mistaken syntax. I speak to him like his best friend speaks to him. I might ask him a question about a certain word or sentence or expression, how it is used in his culture, and then demonstrate that I know more about it than he does. This embarrasses him very much.Once a prisoner starts to talk, rapid follow-up is needed to sort fact from fiction, so that the interrogator knows whether his subject is being cooperative or evasive, and can respond accordingly. Interrogation sessions should be closely observed (many rooms designed for this purpose have one-way mirrors), and in a well-run unit a subject's words can sometimes be checked out before the session is over. Being caught so quickly in a lie demonstrates the futility of playing games with the interrogator, and strengthens his hand. It shames and rattles the subject. When information checks out, the interrogator can home in for more details and open up new avenues of exploration.Religious extremists are the hardest cases. They ponder in their own private space, performing a kind of self-hypnosis. They are usually well educated. Their lives are financially and emotionally tidy. They tend to live in an ascetic manner, and to look down on nonbelievers. They tend to be physically and mentally strong, and not to be influenced by material things—by either the incentives or the disincentives available in prison. Often the rightness of their cause trumps all else, so they can commit any outrage—lie, cheat, steal, betray, kill—without remorse. Yet under suffi-cient duress, Koubi says, most men of even this kind will eventually break—most, but not all. Some cannot be broken.They are very rare, he says, but in some cases the more aggressive you get, and the worse things get, the more these men will withdraw into their own world, until you cannot reach them.Mousa Khoury, the Palestinian businessman who has been interrogated six times, claims that he never once gave in to his jailers. Koubi has no particular knowledge of Khoury's case, but he smiles his crooked, knowing smile and says, If someone you meet says he was held by our forces and did not cooperate at all, you can bet he is lying. In some cases men who are quite famous for their toughness were the most helpful to us in captivity.Interrogation is also highly theatrical. The Kubark Manual is very particular about setting the stage.The manual goes on to recommend lighting that shines brightly in the face of the subject and leaves the interrogator in shadow. There should be no phone or any other means of contact with those outside the room, to enhance concentration and the subject's feeling of confinement. In Koubi's experience it was sometimes helpful to have associates loudly stage a torture or beating session in the next room. In old CIA interrogation training, according to Bill Wagner, a retired agent, it was recommended that mock executions take place outside the interrogation room.A good interrogator is a deceiver. One of Koubi's tricks was to walk into a hallway lined with twenty recently arrested, hooded, uncomfortable, hungry, and fearful men, all primed for interrogation, and shout commandingly, Okay, who wants to cooperate with me? Even if no hands, or only one hand, went up, he would say to the hooded men, Okay, good. Eight of you. I'll start with you, and the others will have to wait. Believing that others have capitulated makes doing so oneself much easier. Often, after this trick, many of the men in the hall would cooperate. Men are herd animals, and prefer to go with the flow, especially when moving in the other direction is harsh.In one case Koubi had information suggesting that two men he was questioning were secretly members of a terrorist cell, and knew of an impending attack. They were tough men, rural farmers, very difficult to intimidate or pressure, and so far neither man had admitted anything under questioning. Koubi worked them over individually for hours. With each man he would start off by asking friendly questions and then grow angrier and angrier, accusing the subject of withholding something. He would slap him, knock him off his chair, set guards on him, and then intervene to pull them off. Then he would put the subject back in the chair and offer him a cigarette, lightening the mood. Let him see the difference between the two atmospheres, the hostile one and the friendly one, Koubi says. Neither man budged.Finally Koubi set his trap. He announced to one of the men that his interrogation was over. The man's associate, hooded, was seated in the hallway outside the room. We are going to release you, Koubi said. We are pleased with your cooperation. But first you must do something for me. I am going to ask you a series of questions, just a formality, and I need you to answer 'Yes' in a loud, clear voice for the recorder. Then, in a voice loud enough for the hooded man outside in the hall to hear, but soft enough so that he couldn't make out exactly what was being said, Koubi read off a long list of questions, reviewing the prisoner's name, age, marital status, date of capture, length of detainment, and so forth. These were regularly punctuated by the prisoner's loud and cooperative Yes. The charade was enough to convince the man in the hall that his friend had capitulated.Koubi dismissed the first man and brought in the second. There's no more need for me to question you, Koubi said. Your friend has confessed the whole thing. He offered the second prisoner a cigarette and gave him a good meal. He told him that the information provided by his friend virtually ensured that they would both be in prison for the rest of their lives ... unless, he said, the second prisoner could offer him something, anything, that would dispose the court to leniency in his case. Convinced that his friend had already betrayed them both, the second prisoner acted promptly to save himself. If you want to save Israeli lives, go immediately, he told Koubi. My friends went with a car to Yeshiva Nehalim [a religious school]. They are going to kidnap a group of students ... The men were found in Erez, and the operation was foiled.There are other methods of keeping a prisoner confused and off balance, such as rapidly firing questions at him, cutting off his responses in mid-sentence, asking the same questions over and over in different order, and what the manual calls the Silent technique, in which the interrogator says nothing to the source, but looks him squarely in the eye, preferably with a slight smile on his face. The manual advises forcing the subject to break eye contact first. The source will become nervous, begin to shift around in his chair, cross and recross his legs, and look away, the manual says. When the interrogator is ready to break silence, he may do so with some quite nonchalant questions such as 'You planned this operation a long time, didn't you? Was it your idea?'Then there is Alice in Wonderland.If this technique is pursued patiently, the manual says, the subject will start to talk just to stop the flow of babble which assails him.Easily the most famous routine is Good Cop/Bad Cop, in which one interrogator becomes the captive's persecutor and the other his friend. A lesser-known but equally effective technique is Pride and Ego, Ego Up/Ego Down, or (as the more pretentious Kubark Manual puts it) Spinoza and Mortimer Snerd, in which the Ego Down part involves repeatedly asking questions that the interrogator knows the subject cannot answer. The subject is continually berated or threatened (How could you not know the answer to that?) and accused of withholding, until, at long last, he is asked a simple question that he can answer. An American POW subjected to this technique has said, I know it seems strange now, but I was positively grateful to them when they switched to a topic I knew something about.CIA psychologists have tried to develop an underlying theory for interrogation—namely, that the coercive methods induce a gradual regression of personality. But the theory is not convincing. Interrogation simply backs a man into a corner. It forces difficult choices, and dangles illusory avenues of escape.A skillful interrogator knows which approach will best suit his subject; and just as he expertly applies stress, he continually opens up these avenues of escape or release. This means understanding what, at heart, is stopping a subject from cooperating. If it is ego, that calls for one method. If it is fear of reprisal or of getting into deeper trouble, another method might work best. For most captives a major incentive to keep quiet is simply pride. Their manhood is being tested, not just their loyalty and conviction. Allowing the subject to save face lowers the cost of capitulation, so an artful interrogator will offer persuasive rationales for giving in: others already have, or the information is already known. Drugs, if administered with the subject's knowledge, are helpful in this regard. If a subject believes that a particular drug or truth serum renders him helpless, he is off the hook. He cannot be held accountable for giving in. A study cited in George Andrews's book MKULTRA found that a placebo—a simple sugar pill—was as effective as an actual drug up to half of the time.Koubi layered his deception so thick that his subjects never knew exactly when their interrogation ended. After questioning, captives usually spent time in a regular prison. The Israelis had bugged the prison with a system that was disguised well enough to appear hidden but not well enough to avoid discovery. In this way prisoners were led to believe that only certain parts of the prison were bugged. In fact, all of the prison was bugged. Conversations between prisoners could be overheard anywhere, and were closely monitored. They were an invaluable source of intelligence. Prisoners who could hold out through the most intense interrogation often let their guard down later when talking to comrades in jail.To help such inadvertent confessions along, Koubi had yet another card to play. Whenever an interrogated subject was released to the general prison, after weeks of often grueling questioning, he was received with open arms by fellow Palestinians who befriended him and congratulated him for having endured interrogation. He was treated like a hero. He was fed, nursed, even celebrated. What he didn't know was that his happy new comrades were working for Koubi.Koubi calls them birdies. They were Palestinians who, offered an incentive such as an opportunity to settle with their families in another country, had agreed to cooperate with Shabak. Some days or weeks after welcoming the new prisoner into their ranks, easing his transition into the prison, they would begin to ask questions. They would debrief the prisoner on his interrogation sessions. They would say, It is very important for those on the outside to know what you told the Israelis and what you didn't tell them. Tell us, and we will get the information to those on the outside who need to know. Even prisoners who had managed to keep important secrets from Koubi spilled them to his birdies.The amazing thing is that by now the existence of the birdies is well known, Koubi says, and yet the system still works. People come out of interrogation, go into the regular prison, and then tell their darkest secrets. I don't know why it still works, but it does.Most professional interrogators work without the latitude given the CIA, the FBI, or the military in the war on terror. A policeman's subjects all have to be read their Miranda rights, and cops who physically threaten or abuse suspects—at least nowadays—may find themselves in jail. Jerry Giorgio, the legendary NYPD interrogator, has operated within these rules for nearly forty years. He may not know all the names of the CIA and military techniques, but he has probably seen most of them at work. Known as Big Daddy Uptown, Giorgio now works for the New York County district attorney in a cramped office in Lower Manhattan that he shares with two others. He is a big man with a big voice, thinning gray hair, a broad belly, and wide, searching greenish-brown eyes. He is considered a wizard by his former colleagues in the NYPD. All of us of a certain generation came out of the Jerry Giorgio school of interrogation, says John Bourges, a recently retired Manhattan homicide detective.Everybody knows the Good Cop/Bad Cop routine, right? Giorgio says. Well, I'm always the Good Cop. I don't work with a Bad Cop, either. Don't need it. You want to know the truth? The truth is—and this is important—everybody down deep wants to tell his or her story. It's true. No matter how damaging it is to them, no matter how important it is for them to keep quiet, they want to tell their story. If they feel guilty, they want to get it off their chest. If they feel justified in what they did, they want to explain themselves. I tell them, 'Hey, I know what you did and I can prove it. Now what are you going to do about it? If you show remorse, if you help me out, I'll go to bat for you.' I tell them that. And if you give them half a reason to do it, they'll tell you everything.The most important thing is to get them talking. The toughest suspects are those who clam up and demand a lawyer right at the start. Giorgio believes that once he gets a suspect talking, the stream of words will eventually flow right to the truth. One murderer gave him three voluntary statements in a single day, each one signed, each one different, each one slightly closer to the truth.The murderer was Carlos Martinez, a hulking former football player who in May of 1992 killed his girlfriend, Cheryl Maria Wright, and dumped her body in New York, right at the Coliseum overlook off the Henry Hudson Parkway. Since many young female murder victims are killed by their boyfriends, Giorgio started looking for Wright's. Martinez phoned Giorgio when he heard that the detective wanted to ask him some questions. Giorgio had pictures of Wright with Martinez, and in all the pictures the young beau had a giant head of Jheri curls. But he showed up in Giorgio's office bald. The detective was immediately more suspicious; a man who worries that somebody might have seen him commit a crime generally tries to alter his appearance.Here is how Giorgio summarizes what turned out to be a very long and fruitful conversation:I was at home last night, Martinez said. She did call me.She wanted me to pick her up. I told her, 'I'm watching the Mets game; I can't pick you up.'That was it. Giorgio acted very pleased with this statement, thanked Martinez, wrote it up, and asked the young man to sign it. Martinez did.Then Giorgio stared at the statement and gave Martinez a quizzical look.You know, Carlos, something about this statement doesn't look right to me. You two had been going out for, what? Seven years? She calls you and asks you to pick her up at night where she's just gotten off work. It's not a safe neighborhood, and you tell her no? You mean a ball game on TV was more important to you?The question was cunning. The detective knew that Martinez was trying to make a good impression; he definitely didn't want to leave Giorgio with any unresolved issues to play in his mind. So it concerned him that his first statement didn't sound right. Giorgio's question also touched Martinez's sense of chivalry, an important quality for many Hispanic men. It wouldn't do to be seen as ungentlemanly. Here was a young woman who had just been brutally killed. How would it look to her family and friends if he admitted that she had called and asked him for a ride and he had left her to her fate—for a ball game on TV? The question also subtly suggested an out: The neighborhood wasn't safe. People got hurt or killed in that neighborhood all the time. Maybe Martinez could admit that he had seen Cheryl on the night of the murder without directly implicating himself. No one ever accused the former footballer of being especially bright. He rose to Giorgio's bait immediately.He said, Jerry, let me tell you what really happened. (Note, Giorgio says proudly, already I'm Jerry!) Martinez now said that he had left his place to pick Wright up after work, but they had gotten into an argument. She got mad at me and told me she didn't need a ride, so I waited until she got on the bus, and then I left. (Look, now he's the picture of chivalry! Giorgio says happily.)Let me take that down, Giorgio said, again acting pleased with the statement. He wrote it out neatly and asked Martinez to look it over and sign it. Martinez did.Again Giorgio squinted at the paper. Yo",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/10/the-dark-art-of-interrogation/302791/,
Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from the CIA interrogation program.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/15/peter-king/peter-king-says-senate-cia-report-found-detainees-/,False,Unrelated,Can not judge,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,,U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT): Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques,"Congress has approved additional, CAT-referencing guidelines concerning the treatment of detainees. The Detainee Treatment Act (DTA), which was enacted pursuant to both the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ), and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 ( P.L. 109-163 ), contained a provision prohibiting the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of persons under custody or control of the United States (this provision is commonly referred to as the McCain Amendment). The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA, P.L. 109-366 ) contained an identical measure and also required the President to establish administrative rules and procedures implementing this standard. These Acts are discussed briefly in this report and in greater detail in CRS Report RL33655, Interrogation of Detainees: Requirements of the Detainee Treatment Act , by [author name scrubbed].Assuming for the purposes of discussion that a U.S. body had to review a harsh interrogation method to determine whether it constitutes torture under either CAT or applicable U.S. law, it might examine international jurisprudence analyzing whether certain interrogation methods constituted torture. Although these decisions are not binding precedent for the United States, they may inform deliberations here.The United States ratified CAT, subject to certain declarations, reservations, and understandings, including that the treaty was not self-executing and required implementing legislation to be enforced by U.S. courts. In order to ensure U.S. compliance with CAT obligations to criminalize all acts of torture, the United States enacted chapter 113C of the United States Criminal Code, which prohibits torture occurring outside the United States (torture occurring inside the United States was already generally prohibited under several federal and state statutes criminalizing acts such as assault, battery, and murder). The applicability and scope of these statutes were the subject of widely-reported memorandums by the Department of Defense and Department of Justice in 2002. The memorandums were criticized by some for taking an overly restrictive view of treatment constituting torture. In late 2004, the Department of Justice released a memorandum superseding its earlier memo and modifying some of its conclusions. In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order providing that when conducting prospective interrogations, U.S. agents are generally forbidden from relying upon any interpretation of the law governing interrogations issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and the final day of the Bush Administration, absent further guidance from the Attorney General.The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) requires signatory parties to take measures to end torture within their territorial jurisdiction and to criminalize all acts of torture. Unlike many other international agreements and declarations prohibiting torture, CAT provides a general definition of the term. CAT generally defines torture as the infliction of severe physical and/or mental suffering committed under the color of law. CAT allows for no circumstances or emergencies where torture could be permitted.U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT): Overview and Application to Interrogation TechniquesOver the past several decades, multiple international agreements and declarations have condemned and/or sought to prohibit the practice of torture by public officials,1 leading many to conclude that torture is now prohibited under customary international law.2 Perhaps the most notable international agreement prohibiting torture is the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention or CAT),3 signed by the United States and more than 140 other countries.4Whereas a number of prior international agreements and declarations condemned and/or prohibited torture, CAT appears to be the first international agreement to actually attempt to define the term. CAT Article 1 specifies that, for purposes of the Convention, torture is understood to meanany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.Importantly, this definition specifies that both physical and mental suffering can constitute torture, and that for such suffering to constitute torture, it must be purposefully inflicted. Further, acts of torture covered under the Convention must be committed by someone acting under the color of law. Thus, for example, if a private individual causes intense suffering to another, absent the instigation, consent, or acquiescence of a public official, such action does not constitute torture for purposes of CAT.The Convention's definition of torture does not include all acts of mistreatment causing mental or physical suffering, but only those of a severe nature. According to the State Department's section-by-section analysis of CAT included in President Reagan's transmittal of the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent, the Convention's definition of torture was intended to be interpreted in a relatively limited fashion, corresponding to the common understanding of torture as an extreme practice which is universally condemned.5 For example, the State Department suggested that rough treatment falling into the category of police brutality, while deplorable, does not amount to 'torture' for purposes of the Convention, which is usually reserved for extreme, deliberate, and unusually cruel practices ... [such as] sustained systematic beating, application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body, and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain.6 This understanding of torture as a severe form of mistreatment is further made clear by CAT Article 16, which obligates Convention parties to prevent in any territory under [their] jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to acts of torture,7 thereby indicating that not all forms of inhumane treatment constitute torture.In general, Convention parties are obligated to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under [their] jurisdiction.8 They are also forbidden from expelling, returning, or extraditing a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.9A central objective of CAT is to criminalize all instances of torture. CAT Article 4 requires States to ensure that all acts of torture are criminal offenses, subject to appropriate penalties given their grave nature. State parties are also required to apply similar criminal penalties to attempts to commit and complicity or participation in torture.10 Accordingly, it appears that even though CAT requires States to take effective measures to prevent torture only within their territorial jurisdiction, this does not mean that States are therefore permitted to engage in torture in territories not under their jurisdiction. Although a State might not be required to take proactive measures to prevent acts of torture beyond its territorial jurisdiction, it nevertheless has an obligation to criminalize such extraterritorial acts and impose appropriate penalties.CAT Article 5 establishes minimum jurisdictional measures that each State party must take with respect to offenses described in CAT Article 4. Pursuant to CAT Article 5, a State party must establish jurisdiction over CAT Article 4 offenses whenCAT's prohibition of torture is absolute: No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.11 According to the State Department, this blanket prohibition was viewed by the drafters of CAT as necessary if the Convention is to have significant effect, as public emergencies are commonly invoked as a source of extraordinary powers or as a justification for limiting fundamental rights and freedoms.12CAT Article 14 provides that signatory States must ensure that their legal systems provide victims of torture (or their dependents, in cases where the victim has died as a result of torture) with the ability to obtain civil redress in the form of fair and adequate compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. According to the State Department, Article 14 was adopted with an express reference to this treaty obligation extending only to the victim of an act of torture committed in any territory under [a signatory State's] jurisdiction, but this limiting clause was deleted by mistake.13CAT Article 16 requires signatory States to take preventative measures to prevent cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment within any territory under their jurisdiction when such acts are committed under the color of law. CAT does not define these terms, and the State Department suggested that the requirements of Article 16 concerning degrading treatment or punishment potentially include treatment that would probably not be prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.14 Unlike in the case of torture, however, CAT does not expressly require States to criminalize acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that occur within or outside their territorial jurisdiction.CAT also established a Committee Against Torture (CAT Committee), composed of ten experts of recognized competence in the field of human rights who are elected to biannual terms by State parties.15 Each party is required to submit, within a year of the Convention entering into force for it, a report to the committee detailing the measures it has taken to give effect to the provisions of CAT, as well as supplementary reports every four years on any new measures taken, in addition to any other reports the committee may request.16 The committee monitors State compliance with Convention obligations,17 investigates allegations of systematic CAT violations by State parties and makes recommendations for improving compliance,18 and submits annual reports to CAT parties and the U.N. General Assembly.19CAT Article 30 provides that disputes between two or more signatory parties concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention can be submitted to arbitration upon request.20 If, within six months of the date of request for arbitration, the parties are unable to agree upon the organization of the arbitration, any of the parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice.21 Article 30 contains an opt-out provision, however, that enables States (including the United States) to make a reservation at the time of CAT ratification declaring that they do not consider themselves to be bound by Article 30.22The United States signed CAT on April 18, 1988, and ratified the Convention on October 21, 1994, subject to certain declarations, reservations, and understandings.23 Perhaps most significantly, the United States included a declaration in its instruments of ratification that CAT Articles 1 through 16 were not self-executing.24 The following sections discuss relevant declarations, reservations, and understandings made by the United States to CAT, and U.S. laws implementing CAT Article 4 requirements to criminalize torture.As previously mentioned, the Senate's advice and consent to CAT ratification was subject to the declaration that the Convention was not self-executing,25 meaning that implementing legislation was required to fulfill U.S. international obligations under CAT, and such implementing legislation was necessary for CAT to be given effect domestically.26 In providing its advice and consent to CAT, the Senate also provided a detailed list of understandings concerning the scope of the Convention's definition of torture. With respect to mental torture, a practice not specifically defined by CAT, the United States understands such actions to refer to prolonged mental harm caused or resulting from (1) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain and suffering; (2) the administration of mind-altering substances or procedures to disrupt the victim's senses; (3) the threat of imminent death; or (4) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.27The Convention's definition of torture includes not only acts committed by public officials, but also those acts to which they acquiesced.28 As expressed in a U.S. understanding on this point, for a public official to acquiesce to an act of torture, that official must, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.29 U.S. implementing regulations barring the removal of aliens to countries where they would more likely than not face torture reflect this understanding.30 Subsequent jurisprudence and administrative decisions concerning the removal of aliens to countries where they may face torture have recognized that willful blindness by officials to torture may constitute acquiescence,31 but acquiescence does not occur when a government or public official is aware of third-party torture but unable to stop it.32 In addition, mere noncompliance with applicable legal procedural standards does not per se constitute torture.33With regard to Article 14 of the Convention, obligating States to make civil redress available to victims of torture, the Senate's advice and consent was based on the understanding that a State was only obligated to provide a private right of action for acts of torture committed in territory under the State's jurisdiction.34With respect to Article 16 of the Convention, the Senate's advice and consent was based on the reservation that the United States considered itself bound to Article 16 to the extent that such cruel, unusual, and inhuman treatment or punishment was prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.35 These Amendments apply in different contexts. The Eighth Amendment bars the use of cruel and unusual punishment as a form of criminal penalty.36 The constitutional restraint of persons in other areas, such as pre-trial interrogation, is found in the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment (concerning obligations owed by the U.S. Federal Government) and Fourteenth Amendment (concerning duties owed by U.S. state governments). These due process rights protect persons from executive abuses that shock the conscience.37 The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause has also been interpreted to incorporate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment at the state level.38The United States has also opted out of the dispute-settlement provisions of CAT Article 30,39 but it has reserved the right to specifically agree to follow its provisions or any other arbitration procedure to resolve particular disputes concerning CAT application.To implement CAT Articles 4 and 5, Congress did not enact a new provision to criminalize acts of torture committed within the jurisdiction of the United States: It was presumed that such acts would be covered by existing applicable federal and state statutes,40 such as those criminalizing assault, manslaughter, and murder. However, the United States did add chapter 113C to the United States Criminal Code (Federal Torture Statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340B), which criminalizes acts of torture that occur outside of the United States. Torture is defined as an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control.41 18 U.S.C. § 2340 further defines severe mental pain and suffering as prolonged mental harm caused byPursuant to § 2340A, any person who commits or attempts to commit an act of torture outside the United States is generally subject to a fine and/or imprisonment for up to 20 years.43 In cases where death results from the prohibited conduct, the offender may be subject to life imprisonment or the death penalty.44 A person who conspires to commit an act of torture committed or attempted outside the United States is generally subject to the same penalties faced by someone who commits or attempts to commit acts of torture outside the United States, except that he cannot receive the death penalty for such an offense.45 Because § 2340A also criminalizes conspiracies to commit torture outside the United States, it arguably could also apply in situations where a U.S. national conspired to transfer an individual outside the United States so that the individual may be tortured.Until 2004, for purposes of the Federal Torture Statute, the term United States referred to all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States, including those falling within its special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, such as military bases and buildings abroad when an offense was committed by or against a U.S. national.46 Accordingly, the Federal Torture Statute would not appear to have applied to cases of torture that might have occurred in such facilities, because they were not considered to be outside the United States. However, pursuant to § 1089 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (P.L. 108-375), the torture statute was amended so that, for purposes of the statute, United States now refers to the several states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States. Accordingly, the Federal Torture Statute now covers alleged acts of torture that might occur at U.S. facilities abroad. The United States claims jurisdiction over actions criminalized under the Federal Torture Statute when (1) the alleged offender is a national of the United States or (2) the alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or offender.47In addition, a number of federal criminal statutes explicitly cover actions that are committed outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States, but nevertheless occur within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States,48 including statutes criminalizing assault,49 maiming with the intent to torture,50 manslaughter,51 and murder,52 as well as conspiracies to commit such crimes.53 Additionally, persons within the jurisdiction of the United States who conspire to kill, maim, or injure persons outside the United States are subject to criminal penalties.54 Grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including the torture or cruel treatment of detained combatants and civilians in armed conflicts,55 are criminalized under the War Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 2441), and persons convicted for an offense under the act may be sentenced to life imprisonment or, if death results from the breach, be executed.56 U.S. military law provides further restrictions on the treatment of individuals detained by the military.57Some of the criminal statutes described above, including § 2340A, provide that the specific intent of the actor is a necessary component of the criminal offense.58 Specific intent is the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with.59 This state of mind can be differentiated from that found in criminal offenses that only require an actor to possess a general intent with respect to the offense. General intent usually takes the form of recklessness (involving actual awareness of a risk and the culpable taking of that risk) or negligence (involving blameworthy inadvertence).60Two memorandums produced by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice in 2002 discussed the distinction between general and specific intent with respect to § 2340A, and suggested that knowledge alone that a particular result is certain to occur does not constitute specific intent.61 However, both memorandums made clear that this is a theoretical matter, and note that juries may infer from factual circumstances that specific intent is present.62 Accordingly, when a defendant knows that his actions will produce the prohibited result, a jury will in all likelihood conclude that the defendant acted with specific intent.63 In late 2004, the Department of Justice released a memorandum superseding its earlier memo and modifying some of its conclusions.64 The 2004 DOJ memo stated that [i]n light of the President's directive that the United States not engage in torture, it would not be appropriate to rely on parsing the specific intent element of the statute to approve as lawful conduct that might otherwise amount to torture.65 Nevertheless, the 2004 DOJ memo alleged that it was unlikely that a person who acted in good faith, and only after reasonable investigation establishing that his conduct would not inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering, would possess the specific intent required to violate the Federal Torture Statute.66 The 2004 DOJ memo also distinguished intent to commit an offense from the motive behind committing an offense, stating that a defendant's motive (to protect national security, for example) is not relevant to the question whether he has acted with the requisite specific intent under the statute.67 In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order providing that when conducting prospective interrogations, U.S. agents are generally forbidden from relying upon any interpretation of the law governing interrogations issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and the final day of the Bush Administration, absent further guidance from the Attorney General.68Although § 2340A provides the United States with a wide jurisdictional grant to prosecute acts of torture, it has rarely been used. As of January 19, 2010, there appears to be only one instance in which a person has been charged and convicted for violating the Federal Torture Statute.69The statute of limitations for prosecution under the Federal Torture Statute is generally eight years after the offense was committed.70 However, there is no statute of limitations in the case of either a capital offense or other offense under the statute that resulted in, or created a foreseeable [sic] risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person.71Although the United States attached an understanding to its ratification of CAT expressing its view that CAT Article 14 did not require States to recognize a private right of action for victims of torture occurring outside their territorial jurisdiction, the United States nevertheless created in the Torture Victims Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA) a private right of action for victims of torture committed under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation.72 For purposes of the TVPA, torture is defined in a similar manner to the definition found in the federal statute criminalizing torture.73 A claim under the TVPA must be commenced within 10 years after the cause of action arose, and a claimant must exhaust all adequate and available remedies in the country where the alleged torture occurred before a U.S. court can hear the claim.74If an act of torture occurs within the United States, a tort claim could be brought by a person seeking redress under applicable state, federal statutory, or constitutional tort law.75Following ratification of CAT, Congress did not adopt implementing legislation with respect to CAT Article 16, which requires each CAT party to prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in any territory under its jurisdiction. There has recently been debate over whether Congress's failure to pass legislation implementing CAT Article 16 was due to an oversight or whether Congress believed that the United States agreed to bind itself to CAT Article 16 only to the extent that it was already required to refrain from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment under the U.S. Constitution and any existing statutes covering such offenses.As previously mentioned, the Senate made its advice and consent to CAT ratification contingent upon the reservation that the cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment prohibited by CAT 16 covered only treatment or punishment of the kind prohibited under the U.S. Constitution. Given this understanding, U.S. obligations under Article 16 can be interpreted in one of two ways.One way is to interpret the United States as having agreed to bind itself to CAT Article 16 only to the extent that cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is constitutionally prohibited. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution applies to U.S. citizens abroad, thereby protecting them from the extraterritorial infliction by U.S. officials of treatment or punishment prohibited under the Constitution,76 non-citizens receive few, if any, constitutional protections until after they have effected entry into the United States (though non-citizens in foreign locations under the complete control of the United States may receive greater protections than non-citizens in other foreign locations).77 Under this interpretation, CAT Article 16, as agreed to by the United States, would not necessarily prohibit the United States from subjecting certain non-U.S. citizens to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment at locations outside U.S. territorial boundaries where the U.S. nonetheless asserts jurisdiction (e.g., on the premises of U.S. missions in foreign states). During the Bush Administration, the DOJ took the position that CAT Article 16, as agreed to by the United States, does not cover aliens detained overseas.78 It is unclear whether this view shall be maintained by the Obama Administration.On the other hand, others have argued that CAT Article 16, as agreed to by the United States, requires the United States to prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in any territory under its jurisdiction if such treatment would be deemed unconstitutional if it occurred in the United States. This view holds that the purpose of the U.S. reservation to CAT Article 16 was to more clearly define types of treatment that were cruel, inhuman, or degrading, rather than to limit the geographic scope of U.S. obligations under CAT Article 16. At least one former State Department official involved in CAT's negotiation and ratification process has endorsed this interpretation as the correct one.79 The Committee Against Torture has also urged the United States to ensure that CAT Article 16 is applied to all persons under the effective control of U.S. authorities, of whichever type, wherever located in the world.80Partially in light of this controversy, Congress passed additional guidelines concerning the treatment of detainees via the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA), which was enacted pursuant to both the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 (P.L. 109-148), and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 (P.L. 109-163), and prohibits the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of persons under the detention, custody, or control of the United States Government.81 These provisions of the DTA, which were first introduced by Senator John McCain, have popularly been referred to as the McCain Amendment. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA, P.L. 109-366) contained an identical measure and also required the President to establish administrative rules and procedures implementing this standard. These provisions are discussed in greater detail in CRS Report RL33655, Interrogation of Detainees: Requirements of the Detainee Treatment Act, by [author name scrubbed].When signing the DTA into law, President Bush issued a signing statement claiming he would construe the McCain Amendment in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief ... which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President ... of protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks.82 This statement has been interpreted as meaning that the President believes he may waive congressional restrictions on interrogation techniques in certain circumstances involving national security, pursuant to his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.83 However, no similar signing statement was made when the President signed the MCA, even though it contained an identical provision barring cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.The DTA does not directly impose criminal or civil penalties on U.S. personnel who might engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees, though such persons could potentially be criminally liable for such conduct under other statutes.84 It does, however, provide an express legal defense to U.S. personnel in any civil or criminal action brought against them on account of their participation in the authorized interrogation of suspected foreign terrorists. The DTA specifies that a legal defense exists to civil action or criminal prosecution when the U.S. agent did not know that the [interrogation] practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were unlawful.85 A good faith reliance on the advice of counsel is specified to be an important factor, among others, to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful.86On September 6, 2006, the Department of Defense implemented the requirements of the McCain Amendment by amending the Army Field Manual to prohibit the cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of any person in the custody or control of the U.S. military. Additionally, eight techniques are expressly prohibited from being used in conjunction with intelligence interrogations:In addition, the Manual restricts the use of certain other interrogation techniques, but these restrictions may be due to other legal obligations besides those imposed by the DTA.88In October 2007, the New York Times reported that in early 2005, the DOJ issued a legal opinion, which remains classified, authorizing the use of certain harsh interrogation techniques by the CIA against terrorist suspects, including head-slapping, simulated drowning (waterboarding), and exposure to frigid temperatures.89 Later that year, as Congress considered enactment of the DTA, the DOJ reportedly issued another classified opinion declaring that these techniques would not be barred under the DTA, at least when employed against terrorist suspects with crucial information regarding a future terrorist attack.90 According to the New York Times, the memorandums remain[ed] in effect, and their legal conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent [Bush-era] memorandums.91 These opinions were the subject of controversy, with some Members of Congress disputing their legal conclusions and claiming that they had been unaware of the opinions' existence at the time the DTA was considered.92 In 2009, the Obama Administration released at least some of the memorandums discussed in these news reports.93For its part, the Bush Administration claimed that appropriate congressional committees or Members were informed about interrogation techniques that had been approved by the Administration.94 According to CIA director Michael Hayden, the CIA waterboarded three high-level Al Qaeda suspects but had not used the technique since 2003.95 Gen. Hayden further stated in congressional testimony in 2008 that waterboarding was not a part of the current CIA interrogation program, and that it is not certain that the technique would be considered to be lawful under current statute.96On July 20, 2007, President Bush signed an Executive Order concerning the detention and interrogation of certain alien detainees by the CIA, when those aliens (1) are determined to be members or supporters of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated organizations; and (2) likely possess information that could assist in detecting or deterring a terrorist attack against the United States and its allies, or could provide help in locating senior leadership within Al Qaeda or the Taliban.97 The Executive Order did not specifically authorize the use of any particular interrogation techniques with respect to detainees, but instead barred any CIA detention and interrogation program from employing certain practices. Specifically, the Order prohibited the use ofAlthough some types of conduct barred by the Order are easily recognizable (e.g., murder, rape), it is not readily apparent as to what interrogation techniques fell under the Order's prohibition against acts deemed to be cruel, inhuman, and degrading or beyond the bounds of human decency. Certain interrogation techniques that have been the subject of controversy and are expressly prohibited or restricted from being used by the military under the most recent version of the Army Field Manual—waterboarding, hooding, sleep deprivation,98 or forced standing for prolonged periods, for example—were not specifically addressed by the Order. Whether or not such conduct was deemed by Bush Administration officials to be barred under the more general restrictive language of the Order is unclear.On the same day the Executive Order was issued, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued a legal opinion which concluded that six enhanced interrogation techniques, when used with specified conditions and safeguards, could be employed by the CIA against high value detainees belonging to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups without violating the DTA, War Crimes Act, or Common Article 3. These techniques included:This memorandum was subsequently withdrawn by the OLC in June 2009, after it concluded that the memorandum no longer reflected its views.100On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order rescinding President Bush's order of July 20, 2007, and instituting new requirements for interrogation by the CIA and other agencies. The new Order generally bars anyone in U.S. custody or control while in an armed conflict from being subjected to any interrogation technique or treatment other than that authorized under the Army Field Manual.101 The Order does not preclude federal law enforcement agencies from continuing to use authorized, non-coercive techniques of interrogation that are designed to elicit voluntary statements and do not involve the use of force, threats, or promises.102The Executive Order also provides that when conducting interrogations, U.S. government officials, employees, and agents may not rely on any interpretation of the law governing interrogations issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009 (i.e., the final day of the Bush Administration), absent further guidance from the Attorney General. It further established a Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies, chaired by the Attorney General, which was required:to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and techniques in [the]Army Field Manual ... when employed by departments or agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring the intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies.103The Task Force was required to issue a report to the President of its recommendations within 180 days of the Order's issuance, unless the Task Force Chairman (the Attorney General) deemed an extension to be appropriate. In July, the Chairman extended the deadline for the Task Force's final report by two months.104On August 24, 2009, the Task Force issued recommendations to the President on U.S. interrogation and transfer policies. According to the announcement, the Task Force concluded, based upon the unanimous assessment of its members, that the practices and techniques identified by the Army Field Manual or currently used by law enforcement provide adequate and effective means of conducting interrogations.105 The Task Force concluded that no additional or further guidance on interrogation was necessary for interrogators within the military or non-military agencies. However, the Task Force recommended the establishment of a scientific research program for interrogation, in order to study the comparative effectiveness of interrogation approaches and techniques, with the goal of identifying the existing techniques that are most effective and developing new lawful techniques to improve intelligence interrogations.106The Task Force also recommended the creation of a special interrogation group to coordinate the interrogation of high-level terrorist suspects. The High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG) will be composed of experienced interrogators and support personnel from law enforcement, the Department of Defense, and the Intelligence Community. The HIG will coordinate the deployment of mobile teams of experienced interrogators, analysts, subject matter experts and linguists to conduct interrogations of high-value terrorists if the United States obtains the ability to interrogate them.107 The primary goal of HIG interrogations will be to collect intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks and deter threats to national security. Measures will also be taken, where appropriate, to preserve the option of gathering information to be used in criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Task Force also recommended that the HIG develop a set of best practices for conducting interrogations and disseminate these among agencies for training purposes.In recent years, there has been some controversy regarding the application of CAT by the United States towards persons captured in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the context of the war on terror and how that application relates to the standards owed under the 1949 Geneva Conventions concerning the protections of civilians and prisoners of war during armed conflicts. The rule of lex specialis provides that when two different legal standards may be applied to the same subject-matter, the more specific standard controls.108 Accordingly, the Geneva Conventions, which proscribe specific rules for the treatment of detainees during armed conflicts, establish the primary legal duties owed by the United States toward battlefield detainees rather than CAT, which is more general in scope.There is some debate whether the rule of lex specialis means that the laws of war are the singular international standard governing the treatment of persons during armed conflict or whether human rights treaties such as CAT may impose complementary duties.109 The position of the Bush Administration appeared to be that CAT does not apply to armed conflicts. In a 2006 hearing before the Committee Against Torture, representatives of the U.S. State Department argued that CAT did not apply to detainee operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantánamo, which were controlled by the laws of armed conflict110 (though as a matter of policy the Bush Administration claimed that it acted consistently with CAT when deciding whether to transfer Guantánamo detainees to third countries111). In support of this position, the United States argued that CAT's negotiating history revealed an understanding by the negotiating parties that the treaty was intended to cover domestic obligations owed by parties and was not meant to overlap with different treaties governing the standards owed in armed conflicts.112 The Committee Against Torture disagreed with this view and recommended that the United States should recognize and ensure that the Convention applies at all times, whether in peace, war or armed conflict, in any territory under its jurisdiction.113 It is not known whether the Obama Administration will take the position that CAT does not legally govern the treatment of persons detained in armed conflict. However, President Obama has issued an Executive Order requiring that all detainees held by the United States during an armed conflict be treated consistently with several domestic statutes and international agreements, including CAT and the Federal Torture Statute.114Regardless of whether CAT itself applies during armed conflicts, certain legislation enacted by the United States to implement CAT requirements does. As mentioned previously, the Federal Torture Statute criminalizes torture anywhere outside the United States, without regard to whether such conduct occurred in the context of an armed conflict. Both the DTA and MCA prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons in U.S. custody, regardless of where they are held or for what purpose. In the 110th Congress, several appropriation bills were enacted that barred funds made available from being used in contravention of CAT and its implementing legislation.115 Both the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 110-28), and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-116), barred funds made available from being used in contravention of CAT and its implementing legislation and regulations, while the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161), more generally barred funds it made available from being used to support torture or cruel or inhumane treatment by any U.S. official or contract employee. In the 111th Congress, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-118), contains a provision barring funds from being used in contravention of CAT or its implementing legislation.Although U.S. courts and administrative bodies have found that severe beatings, maiming, sexual assault, rape, and (in certain circumstances) death threats may constitute torture for purposes of either CAT or the TVPA,116 there is little U.S. jurisprudence concerning whether harsh yet sophisticated interrogation techniques of lesser severity constitute torture under either CAT or U.S. implementing legislation. Severe pain or suffering constituting torture is not defined by either CAT or the Federal Torture Statute.117 In the 2004 DOJ Memo superseding the Department's earlier memorandum on torture, the DOJ concluded that severe physical suffering may constitute torture under the Federal Torture Statute even if such suffering does not involve severe physical pain.118 The continuing relevance of this legal opinion to U.S. agents is unclear, given President Obama's Executive Order generally barring U.S. agents from relying on Bush-era DOJ opinions regarding the laws of interrogation. 119Although few, if any, U.S. courts have had the opportunity to address this issue, decisions and opinions issued by foreign courts and international bodies might serve as indicators of an international consensus for the prohibition of certain interrogation techniques. Assuming for the purposes of discussion that a U.S. body reviewed certain interrogation methods to assess whether they constituted torture for purposes of CAT and domestic implementing legislation, it might consider looking at jurisprudence by non-U.S. bodies for guidance, though such jurisprudence would not be binding upon U.S. courts. It should also be noted that the U.S. military has also barred specified interrogation techniques it has deemed to rise to the level of torture, and a reviewing court may consider these prohibitions as well.120The next section briefly discusses two notable circumstances in which international or foreign State bodies have assessed whether a State's interrogation techniques constituted torture.In 1978, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) heard a case brought by Ireland against the United Kingdom concerning British tactics used to counter secessionist movements and organizations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s, and whether such tactics violated the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention).121 One issue that the ECHR was asked to resolve was whether five interrogation techniques previously employed by British authorities and approved by high level British officials122 violated Article 3 of the European Convention, which provides that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.123 According to the ECHR, these five interrogation techniques, which were sometimes used in combination and other times individually, included:An investigation by the European Commission of Human Rights concluded that no physical injury resulted from the use of these techniques, though certain detainees suffered weightloss and adverse effects relating to their acute psychiatric systems ... during interrogation.125The ECHR concluded that the interrogation techniques employed by Britain violated the European Convention's prohibition upon inhuman or degrading treatment, but found that the interrogation methods did not constitute torture.126 The ECHR stated that a distinction exists between inhuman or degrading treatment and torture; a distinction [that] derives principally from a difference in the intensity of the suffering inflicted.127 The ECHR concluded that while the five interrogation techniques, at least when used in combination, were inhuman or degrading treatment, they did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture as so understood.128 The ECHR did not offer an in-depth analysis as to why these techniques did not cause sufficient suffering to constitute torture, although it should be noted that it appeared that few, if any, of the persons who were subject to the interrogation techniques sustained lasting, debilitating physical or mental injuries. It did note, however, that its inquiry required an evaluation of all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim.129 Accordingly, it may be possible that in different circumstances these interrogation techniques might have been judged by the ECHR to rise to the level of torture.Beginning in the late 1980s and ending in the late 1990s, certain Israeli security forces were authorized to employ harsh interrogation techniques against Palestinian security detainees, including the use of moderate physical pressure. In its initial report to the CAT Committee, Israel argued that the interrogation techniques it employed were in accordance with international law prohibiting torture.130 It specifically noted the ECHR decision declaring that the interrogation techniques employed by Britain in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s did not constitute torture.131 The committee concluded, however, that such tactics were completely unacceptable given Israel's obligations under CAT Articles 2 and 16.132In response to committee concerns about its interrogation techniques, Israel submitted additional information concerning the nature of the interrogation techniques it employed against security detainees. According to the CAT Committee, these interrogation techniques included:In 1997, after examining a special report by Israel discussing these tactics, the committee concluded that the tactics described violated Israel's obligations as a party to CAT, representing a breach of CAT Article 16 and constituting torture as defined by CAT Article 1.134 The committee opinion suggests that some of the interrogation techniques employed by Israel might constitute torture when employed singularly,135 although the committee did not specify how particular methods constituted torture. Despite acknowledging that Israel faced a terrible dilemma ... in dealing with terrorist threats to its security, the committee noted that CAT provides that no exceptional circumstances permit State parties to engage in torture.136 Accordingly, the committee recommended that Israel immediately cease its use of the interrogation tactics described above.137The committee is an advisory body, and its rulings are not binding. However, in 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court sitting as the Israeli High Court of Justice prohibited the use of brutal or inhuman means of interrogation,138 including five specific interrogation techniques at issue in the petitions before it, namely:In finding that these techniques were impermissible under Israeli law, the Court noted that [t]his conclusion is in accord with international treaties, to which Israel is a signatory, which prohibit the use of torture, 'cruel, inhuman treatment' and 'degrading treatment.'139 In doing so, the High Court did not expressly determine whether the prohibited techniques were unlawful because they constituted torture, or some other form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment prohibited under domestic law and international treaties.140According to a 2003 report by the U.S. State Department, Israel was reported to have used extraordinary interrogation methods, some of which included physical pressure at least 90 times since the Israeli High Court's ruling.141 For its part, the State Department reported in 2000 that Israeli security forces abused, and in some cases, tortured Palestinians suspected of security offenses.142 More recently, the State Department has noted that human rights groups claim that torture is being employed.143",https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32438.html,

Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years.",Harry Reid says anonymous source told him Mitt Romney didn't pay taxes for 10 years,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn’t paid any taxes for 10 years.In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son, referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s.Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.Reid continued, He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain, said Reid. But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? … You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds.Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up, Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.Other Republicans leaped to Romney’s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN’s State of the Union that I think he’s lying) and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a dirty liar on ABC’s This Week.Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an unbecoming, corrosive game. Spew first and sweat the details later, or never, Bruni wrote. Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true.On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation.Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years.In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries.But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million.To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent.Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years.Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, probably not.The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s highly unlikely that he paid nothing.It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold, Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also preposterous.Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate, the article said. But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years, White said.Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that the word is out when in fact it was only Reid who put that word out.Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years.Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up.

Romney didn't win did he? Reid said during a wide-ranging interview.So, in Reid's world, it is perfectly acceptable to make a defamatory charge against an opponent to damage his campaign.Reid first made the accusation against the former Massachusetts governor in a 2012 interview with the Huffington Post. At the time, Reid claimed that a Bain Capital investor told him Romney didn't pay taxes for the previous 10 years. This, Reid claimed, was why Romney hadn't released his tax returns.He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Reid said. Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain, but obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look?A few days after the HuffPo interview, Reid made the same charge on the Senate floor, this time claiming as fact that Romney paid no taxes.As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns, Reid said. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.Even though Reid made a slanderous statement that Romney had in fact paid not taxes, without mentioning anything about his Bain source or skepticism, he cannot be sued for that particular statement. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states that members of Congress shall be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place. The only exceptions to this rule are for treason, felonies and breach of the peace.After his floor speech, Reid made the claim again, except this time he again cited his extremely credible source for the accusation.So when Reid directly accused Romney of being a tax dodge, he did so from the safety of the Senate floor. Outside the protection of legislative immunity, Romney was only possibly a tax dodge.Not only does Reid not think he did anything wrong, he's actually proud that his lies might have helped cost Romney the election.Note: The Washington Post's fact checker gave Reid 4 Pinocchios for his claims.

Over the past two years, Romney's effective tax rate was 14.5%, based on the records he's revealed already.Effective tax rates are always lower than top income tax rates, due to credits, deductions and exemptions that cancel out all or much of the income tax many Americans would otherwise owe in taxes. Some 80% of Americans have an effective rate below 15%, according to the Tax Policy Center.Dueling over Paul Ryan's Medicare planDueling over Paul Ryan's Medicare planFor families making $50,000 to $75,000, the effective tax rate is 5.7%.

And if you make $200,000, it goes up to 9.9%.However, households at the highest income brackets -- like Romney's -- make a lot of their money from tax-advantaged investments, such as capital gains and tax-free bonds.

The Huffington Post, however, is constrained by journalistic standards and ethics, which raises the question of whether it was proper for them to print Reid’s allegation without confirming it. The answer isn’t as simple as it might seem.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been dogged, for months, about his failure to follow the precedent of releasing tax returns, set by his late father, George Romney, even drawing boos from a Republican debate crowd in January. The issue resurfaced during his just-completed trip abroad when ABC News’ David Muir asked the candidate if there was “ever any year when you paid lower than 13.9%” in taxes.Romney dodged the question, saying he was “happy to go back and look,” a promise that his campaign did not keep. The Romney campaign has previously responded to Politico‘s query about whether there was any year in which Romney paid $0.00 in taxes by saying, simply, “Not true,” which technically doesn’t rule out Romney receiving a refund, or even paying no federal income tax. If he bought a cup of coffee in any of the years in question, he paid some taxes.The dodging of tax-related questions has led to rampant speculation about what his tax returns might reveal, speculation that Sen. Harry Reid took a step further by making a specific allegation:Now, Reid is not a journalist, so he had no obligation to protect the contents of a private conversation, and neither did HuffPo‘s reporters, Sam Stein and Ryan Grim, because they weren’t the ones who spoke to that Bain investor.They did have a responsibility to try and confirm the quote, which they did, but Reid refused to divulge the name of the investor. They also had a responsibility to point out that the claim was not substantiated, which Reid himself did, and which the reporters underscored by pointing out that it was “impossible to verify if the accusation is true,” and that “as his quote makes clear, he’s uncertain if the information is accurate.”They also pointed out the Romney campaign’s previous denial.The question, then, is why print it if it can’t be confirmed?That’s a judgment call, supported by the newsworthiness, not of Reid’s accusation, but by the fact that Reid made it. For example, when people reported that Michele Bachmann said someone told her the HPV vaccine made their daughter retarded, that quote couldn’t be verified.The difference there, of course, is that the truth (or lack thereof) of the actual claim was easy to determine. In this case, however, Romney’s refusal to release more than (eventually) two years of tax returns makes that impossible. Also noteworthy is that, when contacted by HuffPo, Romney advisor Kevin Madden didn’t say Reid’s allegation wasn’t true, but that Romney has “gone above and beyond the disclosure requirements by releasing two years of personal tax returns in addition to the hundreds of pages of personal financial disclosure documents he has provided to the FEC and made public.”The problem with whack-a-mole questions from the press and carefully-worded responses from the candidate is that there’s too much wiggle room to get at the truth. The Romney camp’s constant refrain that he paid “100% of the taxes that were legally due” ignores the fact that tax returns are only legal until they aren’t. People try to claim things on their taxes all the time that the IRS later rejects, but without looking at Romney’s returns (or the results of his audits), there’s no way to know if his accountants ever threw something against the wall that shouldn’t have stuck, or even if he was ever found to have underpaid, and had to make up the difference.Madden also lashed out at Reid for saying that Romney’s “poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,” telling HuffPo it was “troubling and disappointing that Senator Reid would cite Governor Romney’s father, George, as part of a personal attack against the governor. We have many substantive disagreements with the senator and his policies, but using insults about a father-son relationship is a step too far,” a sentiment that I couldn’t agree more with. It was incredibly hurtful disrespectful, and Reid should apologize.While HuffPo‘s decision to print Reid’s allegation is eminently defensible (especially when you consider that, had he simply blurted this out during a live TV interview, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation), it leaves the door open to unsettling abuse of this precedent, in which other outlets report whatever crazy thing they can get someone to say, without the kind of caution displayed here.Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",https://www.mediaite.com/online/was-it-right-to-print-that-mitt-romney-didnt-pay-any-taxes-for-ten-years/,

According a Bain investor, Reid charged, Romney didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.  In a wide-ranging interview with The Huffington Post from his office on Capitol Hill, Reid saved some of his toughest words for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Romney couldn't make it through a Senate confirmation process as a mere Cabinet nominee, the majority leader insisted, owing to the opaqueness of his personal finances.  His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son, Reid said, in reference to George Romney's standard-setting decision to turn over 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s.Saying he had no problem with somebody being really, really wealthy, Reid sat up in his chair a bit before stirring the pot further. A month or so ago, he said, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office.   Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years, Reid recounted the person as saying.  He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain, said Reid. But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look?  You guys have said his wealth is $250 million, Reid went on. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.  The highest ranked Democrat in Congress, Reid is known more as a back room brawler than a public flamethrower. So his willingness to throw this private conversation into the media frenzy over Romney's taxes underscores the low opinion he has of the Republican candidate.Tellingly, neither Reid nor his office would reveal who the investor was, making it impossible to verify if the accusation is true. And as his quote makes clear, he's uncertain if the information is accurate. The Romney campaign's press secretary, Andrea Saul, has previously denied rumors that Romney didn't pay any taxes at all.But there is limited political downside to the type of open speculation that Reid is making, so long as Romney refuses to budge on the issue of his tax returns. Increasingly, other Democrats are growing more assertive in their goading. In an appearance at the Center for American Progress on Tuesday, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland argued that he could openly speculate as to whether Romney is a tax avoider or cheat because his behavior invites such speculation.Romney recently told ABC News that he couldn't recall if there were years when he paid below the 13.9 percent tax rate that he paid in 2010. Although he said he was happy to go back and look, his campaign declined to do just that.Asked for a response to Reid's latest comments, Romney campaign adviser Kevin Madden said his candidate had gone above and beyond the disclosure requirements by releasing two years of personal tax returns in addition to the hundreds of pages of personal financial disclosure documents he has provided to the FEC and made public.Madden added that it was troubling and disappointing that Senator Reid would cite Governor Romney's father, George, as part of a personal attack against the governor. We have many substantive disagreements with the senator and his policies, but using insults about a father-son relationship is a step too far.Reid has jabbed at Romney before. Indeed, during the HuffPost interview, he seemed to revel in the headlines and fallout his attacks have caused.It's interesting, my guy from Vegas wrote this. He's a snarky guy, [Las Vegas Sun political reporter] Jon Ralston. He's a center guy. I like Jon just fine, but he's cynical, and I guess that's what serves him well. So he criticizes me for saying that Romney couldn't be elected dogcatcher, Reid recalled.My wife said to me -- we don't talk politics very often -- she said, like, 'You shouldn't have said that.' So Stephanie Cutter [President Barack Obama's deputy campaign manager] comes down to talk about politics and outsourcing at my caucus. She said, 'I'm so grateful for Senator Reid, the best remark during the last week, was saying that he couldn't qualify to be dogcatcher.' I could hardly wait to get home to tell my wife.Reid's assessment about the state of the political landscape didn't end at the borders of the presidential campaign. He spoke optimistically about the prospects of maintaining his role as Senate majority leader, offering up private polling data that he said showed four Democratic senatorial candidates ahead -- Rep. Mazie Hirono up 19 points in Hawaii, Sen. Jon Tester ahead by 5 points in Montana, Rep. Tammy Baldwin up 3 points in Wisconsin, and Elizabeth Warren leading by 4 points in Massachusetts.We feel comfortable in the Senate, he said. Where the problem is, is this: Because of the Citizens United decision, Karl Rove and the Republicans are looking forward to a breakfast the day after the election.

But he offered up a flimsy and fact-devoid defense of those 2012 claims.“First of all, there were no brazen lies. What I said is the truth,” he maintained.“There’s no brazen lies. I did what was necessary,” he said a few moments later.During a speech on Aug. 2, 2012, after Romney had become GOP candidate for president, Reid claimed that a source had informed him that the former Massachusetts governor had not paid taxes for 10 years.“As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn’t be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not,” Reid said.Reid produced no evidence to back up his claim at the time, and his statement was widely denounced as a lie by fact-checkers and other political observers at the time.In September 2012, Romney released a notarized letter from his tax preparer showing that he paid state and federal income taxes for the previous 20 years. The lowest federal tax rate he incurred during that span was 13.66 percent, according to the documents he released.In his response on Wednesday, Reid did not reiterate his 2012 claim. Instead, he made a much less serious charge: that Romney had not been truthful about his taxes because he had refused to release all of his tax returns.“Mitt Romney refused and has still refused to show us his tax returns. He gave us the main part of two tax returns. This is when he was running for president. That is not a true sign of what he had done,” he said.This is not the first time that the Nevada Democrat has refused to acknowledge that his comments were baseless.In an interview with CNN last year, he suggested that his statement was warranted because it was effective.“Romney didn’t win, did he?” he told CNN’s Dana Bash.And in an interview with The Washington Post in September, Reid said that lying about Romney’s taxes on the Senate floor was “one of the best things I’ve ever done.”",http://dailycaller.com/2016/12/21/reid-i-did-what-was-necessary-by-lying-about-romneys-tax-returns/,

But Democrats seized on the comments as a way to revive the issue and to once again demand proof of his claims.His statement is the first direct response to attacks by the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies suggesting that Mr. Romney paid little or no taxes in previous years.In particular, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada has alleged — without any proof — that Mr. Romney paid no taxes in some years, presumably by using offshore tax shelters and other legal accounting measures. Mr. Romney had already denounced that as false.But Mr. Romney has steadfastly refused to release more than the single year of returns that he has already disclosed. He has released the full returns for the 2010 tax year and a short summary of the taxes he paid in 2011.In an interview during his trip abroad last month, Mr. Romney was asked whether he had ever paid a tax rate lower than the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010.“I haven’t calculated that,” Mr. Romney told David Muir of ABC News. “I’m happy to go back and look, but my view is I’ve paid all the taxes required by law.”Reporters have pressed Mr. Romney and his campaign to follow through on that offer but had been rebuffed. The campaign has continued to insist that Mr. Romney has released all the tax returns he needs to.Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said that since there was “substantial reason” to doubt Mr. Romney’s claims, “we have a simple message for him: prove it.”“Given Mitt Romney’s secrecy about his returns,” she said, “coupled with the revelations in just the one return we have seen to date and the inconsistencies between this one return and his other financial disclosures, he has forfeited the right to have us take him just at his word.”David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama’s campaign, scoffed at Mr. Romney’s statement.“The ‘trust me, everything’s fine’ approach?” Mr. Axelrod said in an e-mail. “He still can’t answer the basic question: Why not simply do what is the norm — the standard his father set — and release his returns for years back? The argument that he doesn’t want to because his opponents might make something of them is not terribly reassuring.”In an interview on NBC’s “Rock Center,” Ann Romney said this week that releasing additional tax returns would simply provide “ammunition” for Democrats to attack her and her husband.“The more we get attacked, the more we get questioned, the more we get pushed,” Mrs. Romney said. She added that she and her husband had been “very transparent to what’s legally required of us.”“There’s going to be no more tax releases given,” Mrs. Romney said. She added: “Mitt is honest. His integrity is just golden.”Mr. Romney and his campaign have repeatedly said that he does not want to provide more years of tax returns because Democrats will use the information for unfair attacks on his personal wealth.Mrs. Romney echoed that sentiment during the interview Wednesday night.“We pay our taxes,” Mrs. Romney said. “We are absolutely — beyond paying our taxes, we also give 10 percent of our income to charity, so that you know, we have no issues that way and the only reason we don’t disclose any more is, you know, we just become a bigger target.”In the brief exchange with reporters in South Carolina, Mr. Romney responded to a question about his taxes by expressing disappointment about the continued focus on his own financial situation.“I just have to say, given the challenges that America faces – 23 million people out of work, Iran about to become nuclear, one out of six Americans in poverty – the fascination with taxes I’ve paid I find to be very small-minded compared to the broad issues that we face,” he said.But Mr. Romney was clearly ready to use the opportunity to talk about the tax rate that he had paid and to attack Mr. Reid’s allegations.“Harry Reid’s charge is totally false. I’m sure waiting for Harry to put up who it was that told him what he says they told him,” Mr. Romney said. “I don’t believe it for a minute, by the way. But every year I’ve paid at least 13 percent, and if you add in addition the amount that goes to charity, why the number gets well above 20 percent.”Mr. Romney’s comments about taxes came after he fielded several questions about his new running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the issue of Medicare.Mr. Romney said he was eager to have a Medicare debate with Mr. Obama and the Democrats.“I think we’re the ones that brought up the topic,” Mr. Romney said, standing next to a whiteboard on which he sketched out what he said were the differences between the two candidates on Medicare.“I want to make sure that people understand what the president has done in welfare, what the president has done on Medicare,” Mr. Romney said.Writing on the dry-erase board with a black marker, Mr. Romney alleged that the president had cut $716 billion out of the Medicare program, saying that the cuts were made “not to save it.”“It’s not just that he’s cutting $716 billion to make it solvent,” Mr. Romney said. “He cut $716 billion to fund Obamacare.”",https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/romney-provides-further-details-on-tax-history/,

People who make as much money as Mitt Romney have many tricks at their disposal to avoid paying taxes. We already know that Romney has exploited many of these loopholes, stashing his money in secret, overseas accounts in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.“Last weekend, Governor Romney promised that he would check his tax returns and let the American people know whether he ever paid a rate lower than 13.9 percent.  One day later, his campaign raced to say he had no intention of putting out any further information.“When it comes to answering the legitimate questions the American people have about whether he avoided paying his fair share in taxes or why he opened a Swiss bank account, Romney has shut up. But as a presidential candidate, it’s his obligation to put up, and release several years’ worth of tax returns just like nominees of both parties have done for decades.“It’s clear Romney is hiding something, and the American people deserve to know what it is. Whatever Romney’s hiding probably speaks volumes about how he would approach issues that directly impact middle-class families, like tax reform and the economy. When you are running for president, you should be an open book.“I understand Romney is concerned that many people, Democrats and Republicans, have been calling on him to release his tax returns. He has so far refused.

As our listeners know, the Standard is based in Austin – but Limbaugh is not.If he went to Austin to check it out, he didn’t say. On his July 28 show, he read from a web post on I Am A Texan stating that this April, the Austin City Council “passed a preliminary plan” restricting smoke from barbecue restaurants. Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members “these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.”Limbaugh continued: “It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue…What kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?”There has been concern in Austin about smoke from barbecue restaurants, pitting a South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way at all hours has reduced the value of their homes. So what city plan was Limbaugh talking about?We didn’t hear back from him about that. But the web post on I Am A Texan post says the council’s proposal “will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke” at great cost to the restaurants. One business expert is saying it’s going to kill all but the biggest establishments. The post says that’s effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue.I see how Limbaugh would pick up on that. So, the city council in Austin is for real – planning to cut back on smoke from pits?Actually, news stories and city documents suggest otherwise. They show the council, this spring, stopped short of imposing smoke limits.In March, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime barbecue shops. A month later, the council directed city staff to study this up and come back with recommendations, maybe something about smoke-control rules.Then, in May, the Economic Opportunity Committee recommended against citywide smoker limits, saying instead that city officials should review concerns on a case by case basis.So the city could still have been intent on smoke limits?You’re right, there was another committee out there. We wondered about that and we reached out to the committee chair, council member Ora Houston, who declined to predict what the panel would do – but did say it was her preference that the city not ban barbecue smoke citywide.This didn’t figure into our research, it occurred after Limbaugh made his statement, but that committee recently voted unanimously not to ban pit smoke.Well then, the Texas Truth-O-Meter must have found his pants to be on fire?Right!

Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue, Limbaugh echoed. What kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway? he added.Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads.And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on ‘cue restaurants?Limbaugh, according to a transcript of his program, recited as fact a July 25, 2015, web post on IAmATexan.com, headlined Austin City Council Votes to Ban BBQ Restaurants.That post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing:The city council’s current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property.One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue.We didn’t connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply.But Austin American-Statesman news stories, City of Austin documents and responses by a city spokeswoman indicate that after the council talked about imposing controls to reduce unwanted smoke from restaurant smokers, members directed the city manager, Marc Ott, to gather public input and make recommendations. As of late July 2015, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean said, one City Council committee had recommended no citywide restrictions while another council panel, slated to reconvene Aug. 3, 2015, had not made a recommendation.Limbaugh’s claim, Dean said, is not true.Let’s scrape up the details--which extend to the city pulling together this 2015 document delivering a breakdown of Austin barbecue trailers and restaurants and the hours each one operates a smoker (around the clock to three times daily for flavor to not at all).After Terry Black’s Barbecue opened, on Barton Springs Road just south of Lady Bird Lake, nearby neighbors objected to smoke from its pit blowing into their yards and homes--not every day, residents initially said, but often enough depending on prevailing winds. Mike Black said in a January 2015 statement to the American-Statesman that he intended to work with residents to address concerns. In July 2015, residents filed a lawsuit against the restaurant.Credit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino Pio Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn’t embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive smoke scrubbers could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town, John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement.In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property—down from 150 feet. He also said he wanted to look at other smoke-mitigating options besides scrubbers.At a March 31, 2015, work session, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime businesses, and whether there might be a way to target regulations at new businesses or ones that had been the subject of complaints.The Statesman reported that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2014 received two complaints about odor and smoke coming from Terry Black’s Barbecue, and one complaint in 2014 and another in 2015 about an East Austin establishment, la Barbecue. In all cases, the agency determined the odor and smoke were not nuisances subject to state intervention, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said, adding that a nuisance would have to be injurious to or adversely affect human health, welfare, animal life, vegetation or property or interfere with normal use and enjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property.On April 2, 2015, council members voted 9-2 to gather input from neighbors and businesses in the lead-up to a possible writing of smoke-control rules. The issue was to go first to the Economic Opportunity and Health and Human Services committees, both consisting of council members.Specifically, the council’s resolution said members were initiating a possible amendment to the city code to address smoke from cookers, restaurants and trucks and their impact on residences with provisions to be considered including a requirement that restaurants and mobile vendors using a wood- or charcoal-burning stove or grill and located within 100 feet of a property used or zoned as a residence take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of smoke emissions on the lives of nearby residents by relocating smoke-emitting equipment or installing smoke-mitigating devices. The resolution also directed Ott to gather input from affected residents, business owners and others before presenting recommendations to the committees by July 31, 2015.On May 11, 2015, the Economic Opportunity committee voted 4-0 to not pursue a city ordinance either requiring establishments to install smoke-clearing devices or to regulate nuisances. Instead, the members said that city officials, in conjunction with the state commission, should review concerns case by case. Members acted after taking public comments and fielding a May 4, 2015, city presentation indicating that none of 54 restaurant barbecue smokers in the city already had smoke scrubbers.The other council committee also gathered. But it hadn’t made a recommendation by the day Limbaugh suggested Austin barbecue was about to vamoose.Then again, Ora Houston, the Austin City Council member who chairs the Health and Human Services panel, earlier made the motion against the city limiting barbecue smoke by ordinance that was adopted by the Economic Opportunity committee. By phone, Houston responded to our inquiry by saying she continues to prefer that the city address smoke concerns one by one. I would not be a supporter of a motion to have a citywide ban on barbecue smoke, Houston said. That’s what the city is known for, music and barbecue.Limbaugh said Austin is effectively imposing a ban on barbecue restaurants.In early 2015, there was worry that a mandate that barbecue restaurants limit smoke from smokers would have that impact. However, the council didn’t adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it’s poised to do so.

Instead, the committee suggested that Austin deal with the complaints to 311 on a case-by-case basis, as reported by The Statesman. If the charges are justified, it would go to either the Health Department or the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.In March, District 3 Council Member Pio Renteria recommended the potential updated code that would require restaurants and trailers to place wood- or charcoal-burning grills at least one hundred feet from all residentially zoned properties, and install pricy smoke scrubbers. As part of the stakeholder process initiated after the April city council meeting, two committee meetings had to explore the proposal. The Economic Development committee voted against the regulation during its meeting in May, too.District 9 council member Kathie Tovo, who is also part of the Health and Human Services committee, elaborated on her vote to The Statesman, but left the issue open for reexamining in the future:Terry Black’s is currently facing a lawsuit from neighbors in Bouldin Creek over the smoke from its pits.

In turn, that department could refer callers to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which takes complaints about air pollution.Committees forward their recommendations to the full council for consideration — but Council Member Sabino “Pio” Renteria, who proposed the barbecue smoke regulations, said the issue has died at the committee level and that he doesn’t expect another conversation among all the council members.Council Member Kathie Tovo, a member of the Health and Human Services Committee, said she didn’t want to place an “undue burden” on food establishments throughout the city that are “good neighbors.” But, referring to a lawsuit recently filed by Austin residents who say the smoke drifting from Terry Black’s Barbecue has harmed their quality of life, Tovo said the council may need to return to the issue.“I will say that I do not want to see communities be in the position of having to take things through the legal system if it’s a nuisance that the city should be regulating,” Tovo said. “There may be a need to come back and revisit this issue and see if we need to tweak our city’s nuisance ordinance to provide citizens some relief from situations where the only path of responsiveness, it sounds like, is through a state agency.”A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman said the agency received two complaints last year alleging smoke nuisance from Terry Black’s Barbecue, which opened in May 2014 on Barton Springs Road. An investigation of one complaint found the smoke was not a nuisance, and the other complaint was dropped, the spokeswoman said.Renteria had initially proposed that the council approve a resolution requiring food establishments to install smoke-mitigating devices or to move equipment that emits smoke. The backlash from some of Austin’s most prominent barbecue restaurants and food trucks, who said the high cost of such equipment could put them out of business, was swift.Renteria said his proposal stemmed from residents living by Terry Black’s Barbecue on Barton Springs Road and la Barbecue on East Cesar Chavez Street who said the smoke was affecting their health and their ability to enjoy their backyards.LeAnn Mueller, the owner of la Barbecue, said the food trailer moved its barbecue pits so they are about 150 feet away from neighbors. The pits used to be roughly 30 feet away, she said.“We moved everything just to show we’re not here intentionally trying to ruin a neighborhood,” Mueller said. “We’re just trying to pay bills and make sure that my employees can feed their families.”That’s one reason why Renteria said he has “no problem” with the outcome of his proposal: Food establishments realized there are “simple things” they can do to be good neighbors, he said. Renteria said he also found out that neighborhood contact teams can vote food trailers in or out of their neighborhood when they undertake the annual update of planning maps.“My intention was never to go out and have any of this affect any of the businesses that have been in good standing with the community,” Renteria said.",http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-city-council-committee-snuffs-out-proposed-barbecue-smoke-rules/BIAOPnVxSw0wRVYotLMEsO/,

It would destroy Austin barbecue.This matters. Austin is known for its barbecue. On my most recent trip to the city—this past fall to attend the fantastic Austin City Limits Music Festival—I sampled some of the city's best barbecue, at La Barbecue. And I drove down to Lockhart, about an hour outside of Austin, to eat at Kreuz Market, home to what many believe is the best barbecue in the world. (For what it's worth, I'd go a step further and say that I've never eaten a better piece of meat of any sort than the brisket I pawed into my maw at Kreuz's.)One underreported fact of the Austin resolution—the Times story failed to mention it, for example—is that it targets not just the city's wildly popular barbecue restaurants but that other leading symbol of the greatness of Austin's food scene: the city's food trucks. In fact, the resolution's stated purpose is to mitigate the effects of smoke emissions from restaurants and mobile food vendors near residentially zoned areas (emphasis mine).Austin isn't the first city to take issue with food smoke and odors. In 2013, Irwindale, California, officials came close to forcing that city's best known employer, Huy Fong Foods, maker of Sriracha Rooster Sauce, to skip town over complaints alleging the smell of hot peppers used to make Sriracha constituted a public nuisance. (Ironically, Texas lawmakers rolled out the red carpet to try to lure Huy Fong.) Eventually, Irwindale backed down.Several years ago, a giant Washington, D.C., law firm sued a burger restaurant that shared a building with the firm. A judge forced the burger restaurant, Rogue States, to close thanks to wafting burger odors.The Sriracha and Rogue States examples highlight the difference between public and private nuisance law.In general, a private nuisance refers to an activity that does not involve physical trespass, but nevertheless interferes with an individual's reasonable use or enjoyment of his or her property, reads a 2000 Penn State law school publication. A public nuisance is an activity that threatens the public health, safety or welfare, or does damage to community resources.In the former case, a resident claiming a violation would typically sue the alleged violator. In the latter case, a city might sue (as in the case of Huy Fong) or pass a law (as Austin may do).Austin's proposal to control barbecue would wrongly turn what might be one or two cases of private nuisance issue into pervasive issue of public nuisance. There are alternatives to laws, including lawsuits—like the asinine one that forced Rogue States to close.Even if I don't like the results of the Rogue States case, a lawsuit mostly impacts just two parties. A bad law impacts everyone, something Texas Monthly's Vaughn noted in his piece, calling barbecue smoke a hyper-local issue [that] could potentially affect businesses citywide.Even better than laws and lawsuits, though, might be a whiff of common sense and a pause to let the smoke clear. Prof. Ernesto Hernandez of Chapman University Law School—food law expert, native of San Antonio, University of Texas-Austin graduate, and self-described traveler of the Texas Barbecue Belt—agrees.If olfactory issues are really a concern, and not just NIMBYism, then the city should be more transparent and fair, Hernandez told me in an email this week. With public hearings, it can listen to restaurants and residents. Restaurants want to be good neighbors and will often cooperate, but that is not always consistent with NIMBYism.Our smokers are on the second floor so the smell dissipates before it drifts down, and we make sure our fires have a complete combustion so you don't get that gross-smelling creosote, Franklin told the Times. And we make sure kids in the neighborhood get food for their birthday parties—so the positive emotional associations with the smell of his barbecue get imprinted early.Sounds smart. Who could have a beef with that?",http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/09/will-austin-proposal-to-control-barbecue,

The Health & Human Services committee is scheduled to discuss it in a few days, but a ban on barbecue is not on the agenda.","No, Rush Limbaugh, Austin Isn't Banning BBQ","Yesterday Rush Limbaugh ran with a bogus story about Austin banning barbecue. The transcript now on his website, entitled “The Left Declares War on BBQ” echoes a bunch of outdated material from a recent blog post on “I Am A Texan,” which reported that the Austin City Council was banning barbecue. That’s not true.I wanted to figure out why so many people have been asking me about Austin’s impending barbecue ban over the last week, and now I know. The hack(s) at I Am A Texan (IAAT) were first brought to my attention for plagiarism of two barbecue stories of mine. A quick look at some other recent stories shows they don’t much care about stealing content based on this uplifting Cafe Momentum story they lifted two weeks ago from inspiremore.com.In their recent doomsday barbecue article, IAAT notes that Aaron Franklin told Eater, “If this resolution passes, we would be forced to close or move. It would destroy Austin barbecue.” Franklin did say that, and it was a big news day, but that was four months ago. They didn’t pass the resolution he was commenting on, but who would know that after IAAT shared it with their 274K Facebook followers who dutifully shared it enough that Rush Limbaugh took hold of it. Mind you, this is an article that states without irony “I suggest you get your barbecue from Austin as soon as possible so you can tell your descendants how good it was before communism took over.”Here’s Limbaugh’s fresh take on it from yesterday’s show:And then some bright-eyed liberal saw the amount of money and power and control that could be available to them if they mandated every barbecue restaurant to have these smoke suppressors. That’s power, man! That is control. And don’t think there isn’t money changing hands on the extending of these permits and what have you.  I mean, the regulation — the local regulation, zoning and all that — of American society by the American left is one of the greatest economic engine killers there has ever been invented.Here’s the problem. No laws were passed. No smoke suppressors were purchased. Austin is not banning barbecue, but maybe a little background information is in order.In March of this year, the City of Austin was in an uproar about smoke barbecue smoke emissions (which I reported on). Council member Pio Renteria received complaints about barbecue smoke from some residents, and proposed a city code revision. In April, Pio Renteria looked dazed at the big council hearing where the resolution was debated. By that time, the real teeth were already gone from the proposed resolution. Words like “exhaust systems” and “smoke scrubbers” had been replaced by the vague “mitigate the impact of smoke emissions.” It didn’t pass, and was moved to committee. In May, the City Council dropped the matter. The Health & Human Services committee is scheduled to discuss it in a few days, but a ban on barbecue is not on the agenda.All this is to tell you that Rush Limbaugh’s fact checkers are about as skilled as a high percentage of IAAT’s Facebook fans, which is not very much. Barbecue is safe in Austin, but at least we get this great typo (which is better out of context) straight from Limbaugh’s own transcript. “I had one particular room where I smoked and my orifice.”",https://www.texasmonthly.com/bbq/no-rush-limbaugh-austin-isnt-banning-bbq/,

No.,Regulating BBQ smoke gets early approval from city council,"The city council did give preliminary approval to an ordinance but strong opposition prompted the council member who proposed the change to the city code pulled it from the meeting agenda. The measure will not move forward unless it is refiled by a council member.AUSTIN (KXAN) – Austin City Council members debated a plan Thursday to put restrictions on smoke from barbecue restaurants.Council member Pio Renteria asked council to amend city code and regulate the amount of smoke that comes from food trucks and restaurants within 100 feet of residential areas.Renteria said residents complained to him that smoke coming from BBQ joints caused them to not be able to open their windows or enjoy their backyards. People living near the La Barbeque trailer in East Austin told their stories before council.“They smoke several days a week, generally five days a week for 17 hours,” said Bruce Hughes. “I can no longer open windows, the smoke seeps in from the attic.”Restaurant owners also went before council asking for flexibility, especially for places that have not faced complaints.“My concern is that that if we have an ordinance that paints all of us into one group of folk that may not be good neighbors,” said Hoover Alexander, board member of the Greater Austin Restaurant Association. “We’re going to be penalized without considerations of other solutions.”Council members ultimately gave preliminary approval to the smoke restrictions, but recommended making amendments before approving up a final version of the ordinance. The proposed ordinance was removed from the table and the council is no longer perusing it.Austin barbecue lovers, new city rules could force changes to the cooking process. Smoke coming from the pits has some residents fired up. Right now, the city does not have any regulations that state how much smoke can be emitted from restaurants and mobile food venders. And because food trailer parks are moving next to neighborhoods, some residents have complained to their city council members.Pio Renteria, who represents District 3 in East Austin, is now spearheading an amendment to the city code to require any restaurant or food truck that burns wood or charcoal, located within 100 feet of residential properties, to find a way to mitigate the smoke. He is suggesting that businesses either buy expensive smoke scrubbers or use gas-operated pits with wood chips. Renteria said other states use that method to limit the smoke.At Black’s BBQ on Guadalupe Street, they have been smoking meats for 82 years in Lockhart. Pitmaster Kent Black thinks if the city is going to take action, he hopes the rules don’t apply to every business.“Just make it a little more specifically aimed at where the problem is and hopefully not burden all of the other restaurants — where it’s not a problem,” said Kent Black, third-generation pitmaster at Black’s BBQ.Some BBQ joint owners believe changing the way they smoke the meats will change the flavor and say that won’t help business. But Renteria said the complaints he’s received show it’s time to look at this issue.“The smoke is just overwhelming,” said Renteria. “It goes into the neighborhood and lingers there. And the people are getting upset and saying, ‘We can’t sit in our backyards. We can’t open up our windows; the smoke comes in there.'”The city manager has until May 21 to gather feedback from the public and business owners. Then, the Planning Commission will consider changes before sending recommendations back to council. City Council is expected to take public comment during their meeting Thursday.",http://kxan.com/2015/04/02/city-looks-to-regulate-bbq-smoke/,

Fresh off the plane and assaulted by the smell of inferior airport barbecue, these outsiders dream of trays loaded with the region’s famous brisket, ribs, and hot guts sausage as they zoom off into the sticky central Texas night.It’s a question I’ve come to dread. Not that we can’t get barbecue—believe me, if you’re entertaining out-of-town guests in Austin, you plan on it. It’s just that it can be tricky to get barbecue for dinner . Many of Austin’s best-known barbecue joints—places like Franklin , La Barbecue , and Micklethwait —are lunch-only affairs, open until you see the words “Sold Out.” In other words, at some point the brisket will run out, and that time is typically long before sunset.Smoking meat so that it's ready for lunch and dinner is a logistical feat for a restaurant, one that involves round-the-clock pit-minding and advanced holding strategy (like cinderblock igloos that keep the goods from drying out). Luckily, there are a few barbecue places in Austin that make a point of staying open in the evenings.Lance Kirkpatrick, pitmaster at Stiles Switch BBQ , says the restaurant runs on a 24-hour schedule in order to serve both lunch and dinner. “We just keep cooking,” he says. “It’s that simple.” Stiles Switch runs four large Klose pits, and two of them “stay lit pretty much all the time.” (The restaurant is closed on Mondays.)Kirkpatrick says that when Stiles Switch first opened, he worked “14- to 16-hour days regularly” to keep the restaurant stocked for dinner service. Since then, he's hired three additional pitmasters who keep the pits smoking at all hours: Andy Stapp, Alanmykal Jackson, and Bill Dumas.And Stiles Switch isn't the only place that serves barbecue in the evenings. Freedmen’s in West Campus boasts dinner sides that stray from traditional barbecue fare, like smoked beets with goat cheese, along with a killer bourbon selection. (One benefit to eating barbecue for dinner? Whiskey!) Lamberts , downtown, is a dressed-up, sit-down barbecue joint that also serves a variety of Texas classics such as steak, quail, and Gulf seafood. And if you’re looking for late-night, Brown’s Barbecue on the south side is open until 11:00 p.m. on weekend nights, and Scotty’s BBQ and Rollin Smoke on the east side are open until bar time.Whether to serve barbecue all day is a choice every pitmaster has to make for him or herself. When asked why he commits to such a grueling smoking schedule, Kirkpatrick says, “We saw the need for good barbecue at dinner time and decided to make extra efforts to make that happen.” But he doesn’t consider these efforts sacrifices: “It mostly means that we get to do more of what we love.”Where to find barbecue for dinner in Austin:",https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dinner-barbecue-austin-texas,
Austin is effectively imposing a ban on barbecue restaurants.,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/aug/04/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-austin-effectively-banning-barb/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Austin’s Plastic Bag Ban Worse for Environment Than Bags It Outlaws,"(CNSNews.com)-- In an effort to protect the environment, Austin,Texas passed an ordinance banning single-use plastic bags in 2013.However, a recent review concludes that Austin’s bag ban has backfired, creating more negative effects on the environment than the plastic bags it outlawed.“Beginning March 1, 2013, no person may provide single-use carryout bags at any City facility, City-sponsored event, or any event held on City property,” the ordinance reads. “Beginning March 1, 2013, a business establishment within the City limits may not provide single-use carryout bags to its customers or to any person.”Two years after the bag ban was implemented, the city asked the Austin Resource Recovery group to investigate its effectiveness. Their June 10 report, written by Aaron Waters, states that while the ban was successful in lowering the amount of single-use plastic bags made from high-density polyethylene in city landfills, it was actually worse for the environment overall.“The amount of single use plastic bags has been reduced, both in count and by weight,” Waters states. “However, in their place, the larger 4 mil [4/1,000ths of an inch] bags have replaced them as the go to standard when the reusable bag is left at home. This reusable plastic bag, along with the paper bag, has a very high carbon footprint compared to the single use bag.”The 4 mil reusable bags are often made from non-recycled low-density polyethylene and require more resources to manufacture than the single-use bags, Waters explained. Many of the heavier gauge 4 mil bags are also shipped from overseas, which increases their carbon footprint compared to the single-use bags.Waters also reported that the ordinance increases costs for both consumers and retailers. Consumers are spending more money purchasing reusable bags and some businesses are losing customers due to the ordinance.For example, a Here Everything’s Better (HEB) grocery store within Austin city limits must adhere to the ordinance. However, it is surrounded by neighboring towns that have no such restrictions.“The close proximity of the other grocery stores has proven problematic for the HEB in this area of Austin, as they have reported that upon the implementation of the Single Use Bag Ordinance, this store lost between $60,000 to $70,000 per week in revenue as a result of customers choosing to shop at a store which would provide single use bags,” Waters reports.Waters recommended that the city eliminate the 4 mil reusable bags, educate consumers on recycling, and encourage surrounding areas to ban plastic bags as well.There has been some backlash within Texas in the nine jurisdictions that currently have some type of bag ban.The Texas Retailers Association initially sued Austin over its bag ordinance, but later dropped the case. However, earlier this month the Dallas City Council voted to repeal its plastic bag ordinance after a group of bag manufactures filed a similar lawsuit.Then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott also argued that state law prohibits local governments from enacting such ordinances, which have been passed in nearly 200 cities and towns in 17 states. A ban on plastic bags was first imposed at the state level in California.“Texas is being Californianized and you may not even be noticing it,” now Governor Greg Abbott said earlier this year. “It’s being done at the city level with bag bans, fracking bans, tree-cutting bans. We’re forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.”A June 2014 report by the Reason Foundation also found that “for the main environmental effects of concern—i.e. non-renewable energy consumption, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—HDPE [ high-density polyethylene] plastic bags are superior to the alternative options currently available….“Advocates of restrictions on plastic bags frequently assert that their preferred option is for people to use reusable bags. When the impact of washing such bags is taken into account, the environmental effect of such bags is likely worse than HDPE plastic bags—especially in places such as California where fresh water is relatively scarce.”",https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/emily-richards/austins-plastic-bag-ban-worse-environment-bags-it-outlaws,

Rev. 563 (2017) http://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol70/iss2/11 - RE-ZONING THE SHARING ECONOMY: MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY TO REGULATE SHORT-TERM REAL PROPERTY RENTALS OF Cory Scanlon* TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION Icommunity with easy access to your city’s center. Your next-door MAGINE two scenarios. In the first, you live in a quiet residential neighbor, whom you have known for years, regularly rents out his home to one or two tourists who respect the peaceful character of the neighborhood. In the second scenario, you lease a unit in an urban apartment building, and the unit next to you, whose owner you have never met, always has strangers coming and going who leave trash in the common areas and throw all-night parties. Your friends experience the same kinds of problems in their buildings, and your rent has steadily been rising over the past few years. In either scenario, your neighbor’s conduct might be considered illegal under the same short-term rental ordinance in your city simply because, in both scenarios, the property owner is conducting short-term rentals (STRs) for fewer than thirty days. Cities throughout the country are battling the nuisances that sometimes accompany residential STRs in a number of ways. With the rise of internet-based home-sharing platforms, such as Airbnb.com, property owners of all shapes and sizes have taken to the web to rent out their spare rooms or their whole homes to vacationers visiting their communities in order to make a little cash on the side, to keep up with the cost of living 2017] in some of the nation’s most expensive cities, or as a primary means of deriving income.1 The response of many cities, while attempting to address the valid concerns of their citizens, has challenged the limits of the Constitution. At what point must the state, through its municipal bodies, step in to regulate the transactions occurring between homeowners and short-term lodgers? At what point is the state’s regulation an interference with the rights of property owners? This Comment will seek to answer these questions by looking at cases from throughout the country, with a focus on the current legal battle between the City of Austin and STR advocates there. As this Comment will show, cities have extensive authority to regulate STRs under their traditional zoning powers with a view to effective city planning, but such ordinances must avoid rising to the level of a regulatory taking or asserting flawed policy justifications. Cities can avoid the regulatory taking issue by recognizing pre-existing property rights. But STR ordinances may also be attacked if they are guided by hollow or misleading policies that do not promote the general welfare and do not clearly address the kind of behavior they seek to curtail. Part I of this Comment proposes three categories of STR use and gives a summary of how various cities in the United States have attempted to regulate the current STR phenomenon. Part II establishes how modern STR regulations may rise to the level of a regulatory taking requiring just compensation under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution by assessing the impact of a leading Texas appellate case deciding an STR dispute.2 In Part III, this Comment shows how STR laws describe the extent to which cities are allowed to define ( 1 ) the term “family,” ( 2 ) occupancy caps, and ( 3 ) categories of use. Part IV analyzes the merits of various police power justifications cities have used to validate STR regulation. I. SHORT-TERM RENTALS ON SHARING PLATFORMS PRESENT A NEW TYPE OF REGULATORY CHALLENGE Americans have a long history of using their extra space for rental income. This Part will first offer some historical background on zoning regulation and then establish three models of behavior for better framing the future STR legal landscape. Finally, this Part will give a basic overview of zoning law, highlight some of the responses various cities across the nation have undertaken, and show a spectrum of regulation from the more hands-off to the very strict. HISTORY OF THE REGULATION OF LODGING AND THE RISE OF THE SHARING ECONOMY Widespread use of one’s primary residence as a boarding house to supplement one’s income may predate even our Republic.3 Since the beginning of zoning ordinances near the turn of the twentieth century, however, cities have attempted to segregate areas of their territory by classifications of land use, whether residential, commercial, or industrial.4 Regulation of short-term lodgings is certainly nothing new, as cities have long categorized such uses as boarding houses, lodging houses, bed and breakfasts, hotels, motels, and hostels.5 While society generally respects the authority of cities to ensure that a large hotel with hundreds of rooms is not placed in the middle of a large, single-family residential area, a neighbor might simply not care that the house next door is rented out to a tourist for the weekend. Never before have property owners been able to connect so easily with potential short-term lodgers through internet platforms scholars call the “sharing economy.”6 The sharing economy refers to the increasing number of peer-to-peer transactions being performed for services such as car transportation and, as pertinent here, home-sharing.7 Cities face a new challenge in how they must meet the needs of their communities because not all property owners have welcomed the presence of short-term lodgers in their residential neighborhoods.8 At the center of the current debate is the popular internet-based homesharing platform, Airbnb. The company sponsors a mobile phone application and website that allows anybody with a phone and a spare bedroom to post a listing to allow another user to reserve a night’s stay or longer.9 In less than a decade, CEO Brian Chesky and his co-founders took the tech company from a start-up to a global behemoth worth more than thirty billion dollars that serves over 150 million guests located in almost 2017] 200 countries.10 Airbnb is not alone in its business model, as other home sharing companies such as Homeaway.com, Vrbo.com, and Vacationhomerentals.com also allow property owners to easily connect with those seeking STRs through their databases of online listings. HELPFUL TERMINOLOGY AND THREE BASIC MODELS OF STR USE11 Generally speaking, there are three parties to internet STR transactions: the host, the guest, and the platform. “Host” means the party listing the property as an available STR. The host could be either the owner of the property or a leaseholder, although a lease between an owner and a tenant may restrict the ability of the lessee to use the property for STRs.12 The “guest” is simply the person, whether a business traveler or tourist, who books the STR accommodation. The “platform” is the internet service that connects host with guest. Platforms, such as Airbnb, may receive a portion of the rental income from the host for the privilege of using their services.13 The way cities have responded to the regulatory challenges presented by this phenomenon is best understood by setting out three basic models of how homeowners (or long-term leaseholders) have generally used their property for STRs. While there are countless permutations of the models this Comment proposes, STRs can essentially be characterized by ( 1 ) home sharing, ( 2 ) home rental, or ( 3 ) transient rental. In the “home sharing” model, the guest and the host are co-occupants of the premises during the guest’s stay. Home sharing maximizes the accountability of the host because if the guest causes any nuisance to surrounding neighbors, the host is right there to deal with the problem. Austin refers to this type of arrangement as a Type I STR.14 The second model is “home rental” where the host uses her primary residence for the STR, but instead of restricting the guest to one room or STR unit, the guest has rented the entire dwelling, and the host does not occupy the home during the guest’s stay.15 A host under the home rental model is less accountable than under the home sharing model, but still more accountable than under the last model—“transient rental.” Under the Austin ordinance, both the home rental and transient rental models would, in all fairness, fall under the Type II classification, with Type III being an STR of a multi-family dwelling such as a duplex or apartment.16 Under a transient rental model, the host is essentially operating an income property that does not serve as the host’s primary residence but is for the sole purpose of STRs. Hosts utilizing the transient rental model are the least accountable of the three models. Conceptualizing the issue under these three general models is important because the behavior of STR hosts and guests can vary widely, from heavy interference with neighboring property owners to having absolutely no impact.17 Consequently, some activity may warrant modest regulation, whereas in other cases, no regulation would be warranted at all. The thesis of this Comment states supra that STR ordinances can be attacked for not being rationally related to the general welfare. The more the ordinance takes into account these differences in use and the varying degree to which they affect neighboring property, the better the city’s argument will be that it drafted the laws in consideration of the needs of the community rather than arbitrarily. The Type I-III categories used in the Austin ordinance are a good start, but the ordinance still does not consider the primary residence (home renting) versus separately owned income property (transient rental) distinction.18 C. CITIES HAVE RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGES OF INTERNET BASED HOME SHARING IN DIFFERENT WAYS Zoning power is a fundamental authority used by modern cities to structure their development and is considered a legitimate exercise of the state’s police power unless the zoning ordinance is arbitrary or unreasonable and without a “substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.”19 The power to zone is the power to divide up the locality’s geographic area into different categories of land use that are inconsistent with each other.20 Thus, the residential is separated from commercial and industrial areas, and ordinances generally provide for sub-categories and statutory definitions therein.21 Residential districts are usually further separated into single-family and multi-family.22 Scholars sometimes characterize the uses as the Euclidean zoning pyramid, with the most restrictive single-family residential category at the top and the 15.

It is ample to lay out zones where family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.”24 Because STRs do not easily meet either a residential or commercial definition,25 cities have taken a variety of approaches in recent years in attempting to curb their impact. The illustrations that follow are only a small sampling of cities that have begun to regulate STRs.26 1. New York City, New York Perhaps the greatest challenge for city zoning officials is presented by the STR situation in New York City, where the city’s 8,550,405 citizens live with a 27,000 per square mile population density.27 The New York State Assembly amended its Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL—the statute that regulates building codes throughout the state and sets occupancy limits) in 2010 to define “permanent occupancy” as anything over thirty days, thus apartment buildings designated as “Class A” can only be rented out on a month or longer basis with anything less than that being a technically illegal rental.28 New York likely felt the Airbnb boom after 2008 the hardest, leading to the passage of its strict MDL amendment.29 In its report on the Airbnb impact in New York City, the Attorney General’s office cites mostly fire and safety concerns for apartment buildings that are different from hotels, and not required to meet the same code standards,30 but the state was also motivated by a desire to preserve affordable housing.31 After the amendment was passed, the Attorney General brought a subpoena against Airbnb to provide host information in anticipation of an enforcement action in 2014, but the New York Supreme Court in Albany quashed the subpoena as overbroad, in favor of Airbnb’s motion.32 Airbnb and New York officials will likely continue struggling to find common ground for the foreseeable future. 2. Santa Monica, California The approach of officials in the Los Angeles area has generally been comparable to those in New York because in Santa Monica the city has decided to strictly prohibit whole-dwelling rentals in residential neighborhoods.33 Santa Monica is a popular tourist destination for Los Angeles visitors with its world class surfing beaches and famous amusement park pier.34 “Vacation rental,” as Santa Monica defines the term, encompasses both the home rental and transient rental models, and both activities are equally prohibited by Chapter 6 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code.35 Home sharing, as defined under this Comment’s model and Santa Monica’s definition, is, however, allowed with authorization from the city in the form of a permit.36 Santa Monica states in its city council report on STRs that illegal STRs have “established a strong presence in the City and continue[ ] to flourish with little sign of abatement.”37 The city does not have the resources that would be required to bring effective enforcement actions against all 1,700 listings the city estimates are being illegally marketed.38 Therefore, enforcement actions are brought on a complaint basis.39 A man named Scott Shatford, who rented various properties in violation of the ordinance, was recently convicted in a plea deal with the city, compelled to pay a $3,500 fine, and placed on two years’ probation.40 He also agreed not to further list properties in violation of the ordinance.41 Shatford owned five properties that he listed in violation of the Santa Monica ordinance and openly “boasted” about how he thought Santa Monica would not be able to enforce its new law against him.42 Even though Shatford knew the listings were illegal, he took the risk because, in his words, “the money’s too good.”43 Mr. Shatford’s experience should 2017] serve as a warning for hosts who want to publicly take on their home city’s STR regulation efforts. This story also shows how seriously some cities are taking enforcement of their STR codes. 3. Denver, Colorado Some cities have taken a more liberal approach in regulating STRs in order to encourage the tourism industry and gain valuable tax revenue.44 Denver, while still requiring licenses at an annual rate of twenty-five dollars, does not bar the home renting model.45 Denver’s ordinance requires that transient occupancy taxes be paid and that proof of insurance be given.46 The ordinance limits licensees to one primary residence and requires documentary proof to establish the address as the host’s primary residence.47 Denver recognizes the STR as an approved accessory use in any residential district, even where the host is not present for the stay.48 Denver, along with some cities in other states,49 generally takes a more favorable view of home sharing than the city has in New York or Santa Monica.50 THE AUSTIN LAWSUIT—MAXIMIZING LAND USE PREROGATIVES AND TESTING CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS One of the more recent STR litigation battles working its way through the courts is the dispute between the City of Austin, Texas, and STR proponents there.51 For the past few decades Austin has hosted a massive city-wide music, film, and technology festival in March called South By Southwest (SXSW).52 Austin also plays host to the annual Austin City Limits Music Festival, and many other events that are a nationwide tourist draw throughout the year.53 During these events, lodging in the city tends to reach maximum capacity, and many of the visitors turn to STR platforms to find places to stay.54 A group of hosts who profit from their STRs in Austin now seek to challenge the new ordinance in Zaatari v. City of Austin.55 The Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), a property rights and free-enterprise advocacy group, represents both hosts and guests in Austin in their suit against the city.56 Plaintiffs claim that Austin’s STR ordinance is an illegal interference with due process, assembly rights, freedom of movement, and privacy rights under the Texas Constitution.57 Contrary to the approach authorities took in the New York battle, where the state and municipal interests were aligned, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton entered the lawsuit by filing a plea in intervention against Austin, claiming that the regulations violate the constitutional rights of Texas citizens.58 For its part, Austin entered a general denial to the claims of plaintiffs.59 Austin originally enacted its ordinance under a permitting scheme that gave different licenses for the different types of STRs that the host sought to conduct in exchange for a licensing fee.60 The driving force behind enacting stricter regulations to Austin’s STR market was a desire to counter the nuisances attendant to what residents called “commercial short-term rentals” operating right next to their single-family homes.61 Testimony at the City Council hearings described many instances of latenight parties with throngs of people lasting through the night, along with the accompanying noise, trash, trespassing, and even public urination by STR guests.62 Because so many Austin residents were coming forward with these cases, which STR advocates characterized as merely “bad actors,”63 the city was eventually compelled to act. It made extensive amendments to its 2017] STR ordinance in early 2016 to, among other things, place a six-unrelated-adult occupancy cap per dwelling and require a local point of contact for out of town owners.64 But it also included many more invasive provisions, such as § 25-2-795(E), which reads: “A licensee or guest may not use or allow another to use a short-term rental for an outside assembly of more than six adults between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.”65 Furthermore, “assembly” was defined in the statute to basically encompass any activity “other than sleeping.”66 Hence, if an STR guest wanted to host a barbeque at his rental, he would be capped at five friends or family members, no matter the scale of the rental.67 When read along with subsection (D) (“[a] . . . guest may not use or allow another to use a short-term rental for an assembly between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.”),68 there is a strong case for what the TPPF has called, “a bedtime for tenants.”69 Thus, the Austin ordinance is unique in that none of the other ordinances from other cities discussed supra contain such extensive provisions seeking to regulate personal conduct within their respective STR regulatory frameworks.70 Austin no longer issues Type II permits, which encompass both the home rental and transient rental models, and seeks to phase out Type II rentals by 2022.71 The result of the Austin litigation will likely set a trend for how many other cities will seek to regulate STRs going forward because it will show how far a city could be allowed to go concerning this evolving area of the law.72 Essentially, the lawsuit can be boiled down to two issues. The first issue is whether the ordinance is an unconstitutional taking because it deprives certain homeowners of all beneficial use of their land.73 This is the claim brought by the Texas Attorney General and has the most relation to the zoning powers discussed infra.74 The second issue is whether the ordinance exceeds the limits of the Due Process Clause and goes beyond being a pure zoning regulation by attempting to closely circumscribe certain categories of personal conduct.75 As to the first issue, this Comment will argue that the municipality can regulate STRs under its traditional zoning powers by setting occupancy caps and by preventing commercial activity in residential zones. The plaintiffs in Zaatari raise important freedom of assembly and due process questions in their pleadings about the extent to which the city should be allowed to designate who and how many people a person has over to a residence.76 The due process claim is partially addressed by Part II’s discussion of the Supreme Court’s decision in Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas in Part II.B., infra,77 and by Part III’s policy justification analysis. A more in-depth analysis of the plaintiff’s freedom of assembly claim is warranted but is beyond the scope of this Comment. II. STRIPPING STR RIGHTS COULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A REGULATORY TAKING An STR host who seeks to resist the impact of a new regulation may do so by arguing that the state action is a type of interference with property rights that is called a regulatory taking. This Part sets out the applicable U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence defining this legal principle, analyzes an important Texas case that applies this standard to STR prohibitions by the Village of Tiki Island, and assesses what the likely impact will be for litigants in the Austin case. Furthermore, this Part discusses STR use within the context of the legal doctrine of pre-existing use. A. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT DEFINING REGULATORY TAKING “Regulatory taking” is a term of art that should be distinguished from a normal taking. The Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, and similar state constitutional provisions, usually involve applying eminent domain, which is the legal principle allowing a public entity to seize private lands for a public purpose if it pays the private owner “just compensation.”78 This form of taking involves government physically entering, occupying, reforming, or destroying property.79 When a physical taking happens, making a determination that government has taken the land and calculating its value is relatively straightforward.80 However, the government may also impose restrictions that, while not a “physical invasion” for public use, interfere with the property owner’s rights in the land to such an extent that a regulatory taking occurs and justice demands that the property owner be compensated.81 The Supreme Court further clarified that there are two distinct categories where there may be an instance of regulatory taking in Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council.82 The first is where government regulation causes the property owner to suffer a physical incursion into the property, “no matter how minute,” and the second is where the property owner is denied 76. See Orig. Pet., supra note 55, at 1. 77. 416 U.S. 1, 9 (1974). 78. See U.S. Const. amend V; see also Tex. Const. art. I, § 17(a). 79. Pa. Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978) [hereinafter Penn Central]. 80. See id. 81. Id. at 127–28. 82. 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992). 2017] “all economically beneficial or productive use of land.”83 This second category has been interpreted to mean that the owner suffers a total loss in using the land, akin to a complete public seizure, and not a minor loss in value.84 Finally, the Court reiterated the principle that if a regulation does not have a substantial relation to a legitimate state interest, then the regulation is a taking.85 But since Lucas, overturning a regulation of private property under the rational relation test has been more appropriately cast as a Due Process question rather than a Takings question by the Supreme Court in Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc.86 In her majority opinion, Justice O’Connor explained that: Instead of addressing a challenged regulation’s effect on private property, the “substantially advances” inquiry probes the regulation’s underlying validity. But such an inquiry is logically prior to and distinct from the question whether a regulation effects a taking, for the Takings Clause presupposes that the government has acted in pursuit of a valid public purpose.87 However, using the “substantially advances” test in establishing a taking remains viable under Texas law because the Supreme Court of Texas has not yet abrogated that standard in the wake of Lingle.88 Any municipal regulations seeking to curtail STR use in residential zones do not involve a taking in the traditional sense because they do not involve the government physically seizing a homeowner’s property for a public purpose; thus, takings claims against STR ordinances will necessarily be of the regulatory variety.89 Practically speaking, if a court deems an STR ordinance to be a taking, the ordinance will probably be amended and STR hosts will be allowed to continue with their activities because the city could not realistically compensate them all adequately given the proliferation of STR use.90 Pennsylvania Central Transportation Company v. City of New York is a leading case helping to explain regulatory takings by acknowledging that while there is no “set formula” to defining when government must compensate, there are still relevant factors to consider.91 These factors include: ( 1 ) the general economic impact upon the property owner, ( 2 ) the extent to which a “distinct investment backed expectation” is frustrated, and ( 3 ) the nature of the government interference.92 Not every slight interference or economic impact upon a property owner by some action of government will result in compensation because under such a regime “[g]overnment could hardly go on.”93 In Penn Central, New York City passed a landmark preservation law giving the Board of Estimate authority to designate historical landmarks and impose building restrictions on those property owners.94 The Pennsylvania Central Transportation Company (Penn Central), as owner of the Grand Central Station, sought to establish a regulatory takings claim because its partner, UGP, a real estate company, was restricted from building a multi-story office building on top of the terminal.95 Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, held that there could be no cognizable claim for just compensation against the city.96 The Court reasoned that the landmark law did not impact Penn Central’s ability to continue its transportation operations as it had prior to the law’s passage and that Penn Central and its partners conceded that a decrease in property value alone cannot establish a taking.97 B. FOR EXISTING STR LICENSE HOLDERS IN TEXAS, BANNING STR USE HAS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE PROPERTY OWNER AND INTERFERES WITH INVESTMENT-BACKED EXPECTATIONS In one of the few Texas cases to address the issue, the Texas Court of Appeals, in Village of Tiki Island v. Ronquille, decided an STR dispute in favor of the property owner, instead of the city as in Penn Central.98 The court applied the Penn Central framework and decided that an STR prohibition could plausibly constitute a regulatory taking under the Texas Constitution.99 Plaintiffs in Tiki Island were condominium owners in a resort community outside of Galveston on the Gulf Coast seeking injunctive relief after the village passed an ordinance prohibiting their STR activities.100 As many plaintiffs in STR cases have tended to do,101 the hostproperty owners in Tiki Island brought a temporary injunction seeking to 2017] preclude the city from enforcing the new ordinance on them in anticipation of a trial and final judgment on the merits.102 Under the Texas standard for injunctive relief, the elements of a temporary injunction are ( 1 ) a valid suit against the defendant, ( 2 ) a likelihood of success on the merits, and ( 3 ) “a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury” if equitable relief is denied.103 Preliminary injunctions are crucial for STR hosts who depend on their rentals for income because the injunctions help to “preserve the status quo of the litigation’s subject matter” leading up to a trial on the merits as well as keep the STR host from having to suspend operations during the possible years of litigation the case might endure.104 Equitable relief is also highly discretionary for judges; therefore, advocates on both sides of the aisle should use policy arguments bearing on these controversial STR zoning issues.105 With this procedural backdrop, the court examined the takings claim under the familiar factors from Penn Central of what the economic impact was upon the property owners, whether there was an interference with “distinct investment-backed expectations,” and what the “character of the government action” was.106 The factors are considered non-exhaustive, and a totality of the circumstances analysis is required to determine the appropriate balance of interests.107 Since this case arose on an interlocutory appeal, the issue was whether the evidence based on the pleadings could satisfy the standards for the trial court’s grant of the injunction under abuse of discretion deference.108 Because the court found that the trial court could issue the injunction within its discretion, the court upheld the decision that plaintiffs adequately plead economic impact and interference with investment-backed expectation so as to meet the requirements of irreparable harm and probable success on the merits.109 The court determined that the plaintiffs had shown that there would be a significant economic impact on their property values if unable to continue their STR use.110 The court based the finding on evidence of one plaintiff’s stated income of $25,000 in 2014 and the live testimony of the homeowners that they would be unable to generate such profits in the future.111 These circumstances were distinguishable from a blocked realestate project for which the law does not necessarily recognize a right to lost profits if government regulation frustrates such efforts because the government need not guarantee profitability for property owners subject to its control.112 The Tiki Island court’s approach to factoring in the economic impact to an STR host is not unique to Texas law, or even state law for that matter.113 A Second Circuit case, Dexter 345 Inc. v. Cuomo, provides a useful comparison to Tiki Island because the claims of property owners were nearly identical, and both courts addressed the economic impact of barring STRs under the takings framework.114 Plaintiff building owners in New York City sought injunctive relief from enforcement of the state’s new MDL provisions.115 The hosts owned “class A” dwellings under the New York MDL,116 and were thus prohibited from STR activity but could rent on a more long-term basis.117 Prior to the MDL’s amendment, the property owners had a regular practice of renting some of the rooms on a long-term basis and some as STRs.118 The Second Circuit reached the opposite result from Tiki Island in finding that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently plead an irreparable harm because they did not assert easily calculable figures for lost profits from STR income.119 The investment backed-expectation factor for the Tiki Island plaintiffs was manifest to the court because of representations made by the village and due to the surrounding circumstances.120 In other words, the court found that because the village wrote its ordinance specifically to grandfather in certain pre-existing condos that were lawfully being used for STRs before the ordinance made STRs unlawful, plaintiffs had an investmentbacked expectation that they could continue STR activities in reliance on the village’s ordinance.121 Furthermore, the ordinance permitted the continued use of the homes “for the purpose for which [they were] constructed and used prior to their acquisition, i.e., a single family residence,” and because the village failed to show that this use was inconsistent with STR use, a valid investment backed expectation was present.122 Also, that many residents had used their properties for STRs in the preceding twenty years was relevant and indicative of investmentbacked expectation.123 2017] THE INVESTMENT-BACKED EXPECTATION FACTOR RAISES THE QUESTION OF APPLYING PRE-EXISTING USE DOCTRINE Whether there is an investment-backed expectation is perhaps the most important issue to consider for the purposes of predicting the result of the Austin dispute and, therefore, STR disputes elsewhere, because it invokes the question of pre-existing land use.124 Under the law in most United States jurisdictions, when a new zoning ordinance changes the allowable land uses in a certain zone, those in possession of land in said zone will be allowed to continue their operations, which were lawful prior to the ordinance, as a nonconforming use and are exempt from the new ordinance.125 Otherwise, if the city wants to terminate a valid nonconforming use, it is subject to paying just compensation under the Takings Clause.126 At least one state court has explicitly found that STR use can be construed as a valid nonconforming use when the owner’s use predates the new ordinance.127 Therefore, as we see in Tiki Island, the municipality cannot necessarily ban STRs, if they can be said to be a nonconforming use, without being subject to the Takings Clause.128 Of course, as it was in Tiki Island, most cities will write grandfathering provisions into their ordinances recognizing such nonconforming use as valid.129 The most important takeaway from Tiki Island, at least for Texas litigants, is that the court established that STR use is not necessarily inconsistent with single-family residential use, the most restrictive category on the Euclidean zoning pyramid.130 While this analysis may be legally flawed for reasons that will be further established in this Comment, it is not a completely unreasonable proposition considering the circumstances for the particular community at issue in Tiki Island. As even the village’s government website admits, Tiki Island is a beach community with “resort-type living” and a prime spot for fishing.131 So for the village to suddenly ban a large group of owners, who never lived in these condos fulltime, from using them for what the owners were fully justified in believing was what they were meant for, our sense of justice would rightly be offended.132 Interested parties from both sides in these disputes will likely use Tiki Island as a guide for both writing and fighting STR ordinances. Because the presumption of validity for zoning laws under the police power is so strong,133 STR advocates will certainly face an uphill battle to prove a regulatory taking. But establishing a claim is now a legal possibility in the wake of Tiki Island’s holding.134 Where a prospective plaintiff can show that the STR use of the property predates the passage of restrictive ordinances, the property generated a specific amount of income, and the city at least passively allowed it, the plaintiff will have an easier course under the Penn Central standard in establishing that a “distinct investmentbacked expectation” will be frustrated and that a heavy economic impact will result if an STR permit is denied or rolled back.135 For some of the plaintiffs in Zaatari, including Mr. Zaatari himself, the takings claim is probably unripe because Austin continues to recognize these parties’ STR permits.136 City officials writing ordinances, issuing permits, and dealing with STR hosts informally do have the power to shape their communities through prospective zoning laws that regulate STR activity, especially in singlefamily residential zones.137 But such power must be exercised within the limits of the Constitution and existing case law interpreting the scope of zoning authority.138 Cities must recognize that many property owners may have rights under a nonconforming use theory or a regulatory taking theory, especially if the city grants hosts STR licenses and later seeks to further restrict those hosts’ activities.139 But the ability of STR hosts to assert such a claim depends in large part on how to characterize the activity, whether accessory versus principal or residential versus commercial.140 The following Part will discuss these legal fault lines in more detail. 2017] III. STATUTORY INTERPRETATIONS OF ZONING ORDINANCES MAY PRESENT A CHINK IN THE ARMOR OF THE POLICE POWER PRESUMPTION Municipalities writing zoning ordinances enjoy a rather strong presumption of validity under the police power.141 However, as this Part will show, courts may find ordinances too restrictive or too vague.142 A court might find that a city is not interpreting its own ordinance correctly as written,143 and thus the uses a city seeks to prohibit are construed as perfectly legal under the applicable ordinance. This Part first explains the special protection the Supreme Court has recognized for single-family residential districts and then turns to how poorly drafted ordinances can provide an opening for STR plaintiffs to protect their property interests. Lastly, this Part will analyze the commercial/residential use distinction in zoning laws and how it has been applied to regulation of STRs by suggesting how these approaches can be improved. This Part argues that the municipal practice of simply casting STRs as commercial, and then banning their use, fails to recognize that much of the host activity has little impact on neighboring property, and ordinances should be more carefully drafted to account for the vast differences in STR host behavior. A. OCCUPANCY CAPS WITHIN STR ORDINANCES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE GENERAL HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELFARE AS A MATTER OF POLICE POWER VALIDITY Any discussion of STR freedoms must consider the special power the Supreme Court has recognized of cities to protect residents in single-family districts from the impacts of incompatible use under the police power.144 Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas addressed whether the city’s definition of a single family as no more than two people “[un]related by blood, adoption, or marriage” living together under the same roof could be sustained in the face of several constitutional arguments, including a violation of the freedom to associate.145 The Court found that in enacting the ordinance, the village sought to address the growing problems of urbanization and boarding houses creeping into quiet residential neighborhoods.146 It reasoned that legislative bodies should be given broad powers to improve the public welfare, which encompasses such ideals as aesthetics, spaciousness, and cleanliness; and prevents scourges such as disease, overcrowding, and “misery.”147 The Supreme Court, however, also placed limits on the city’s power to define the occupant’s characteristics for single-family dwellings in Moore v. City of East Cleveland.148 Under East Cleveland’s zoning ordinance, single-family use was restricted to only certain categories within a nuclear family, thus criminal sanctions were brought for a grandmother and grandson living under the same roof.149 For the Court, such an intrusion into private and family life could hardly be sustained as a rational exercise of the police power, and the ordinance was struck.150 Many jurisdictions set a limit on how many unrelated people may occupy a single-family residence at one time through their zoning ordinances.151 Courts are often faced with the task of interpreting zoning statutes that define allowable uses, and the language contained in these ordinances can range in clarity from unconstitutionally vague to highly technical.152 One case of the technical variety, Hall v. Zoning Board of Appeals, interpreted Edgartown, Massachusetts’s zoning by-laws.153 The court found that if the number of occupants exceeded the allowable number for a residential dwelling, and the ordinance defined “transient residential facilit[ies]” as “lodging houses with a capacity of more than four guest beds,” then the residential use was transformed into an impermissible “transient residential facility.”154 Under Edgartown’s zoning by-laws, people in residential districts could have up to four boarders, but plaintiffs in Hall were found to have exceeded these allowable limits when the evidence showed that the subject dwellings housed between seven to ten occupants, although only four names appeared on the lease.155 The court found that exceeding the occupancy limits set out by the zoning by-law was a use that would ordinarily be inconsistent with single-family residential use.156 But where a zoning statute fails to define its terms in seeking to limit STR activity with clear language, the city can be frustrated in its planning efforts by conscientious litigants intent on profiting from their property.157 Whatever Sandusky, Ohio was attempting to proscribe, the appeals court found that it did not use clear enough language when it wrote its transient rental ordinance.158 The ordinance defined a “Dwelling” to be a “building designed or occupied exclusively for non-transient residential use (including one-family, two-family, or multifamily buildings).”159 Because the statute failed to define “non-transient residential use” by using a certain time frame, whether days or weeks, the court found the ordinance void for vagueness under Ohio state standards.160 Drafting errors, or having a court construe statutory language in a manner that the legislative body did not necessarily intend, are not confined to local ordinances, as one case in New York shows.161 Prior to New York amending its MDL to more strictly proscribe STRs in Class A dwellings, the MDL defined the Class A multiple dwelling as “a multiple dwelling which is occupied, as a rule, for permanent residence purposes.”162 Furthermore, under the city’s Zoning Regulation (ZR), the owners’ buildings were designated as “apartment hotels” in which the primary use of the building was to be for permanent residency.163 Local hotel businesses that had occupied certain apartment buildings since the 1940s, and carried on vacation rentals alongside their long-term leases, prevailed against an injunction brought by the city because of this statutory ambiguity.164 The court found that use of the language “as a rule” and “primary purpose” meant that a minority of the building’s units could be used as STRs under these statutes and that the city failed to show that a majority of the units were being used for transient purposes in violation of a clear statutory rule.165 New York would of course amend its MDL in 2010 to more clearly state that no STRs in Class A dwellings would be permitted.166 As the cases in this Subsection illustrate, local governments have broad ranging powers to regulate the activity of property within single-family residential districts. But as the cases from Parts II.B. and C have also shown, cities might bind themselves to observing pre-existing property rights that frustrate planning because of the representations they make to the public, the permits they issue, and the uses they allow.167 Thus, key aspects to effective planning include clear drafting of ordinances, observation of vested property rights by the use of grandfathering provisions, constitutionally permissible definitions of “family,” and the use of specific occupancy caps when cities want to expand residential uses. As we saw in 158. See id. 159. Id. at 1265. 160. Id. at 1268. 161. City of New York v. 330 Continental LLC, 60 A.D.3d 226, 227 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009). 162. Id. at 228 (quoting N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law § 4 (McKinney) (amended 2011) (emphasis added). 163. Id. at 229 (emphasis added). 164. Id. at 228, 230. 165. Id. at 230 (“There is no requirement under either the ZR or the certificates of occupancy that the subject buildings be used exclusively for permanent occupancy.”). 166. See supra Part I.C.1. 167. See supra Part II.B–C. Belle Terre, the city may go so far as to restrict a single-family dwelling use to only members of the same family unit with no more than two unrelated persons.168 Given this permissible restriction, the six-unrelated-person rule set out by the Austin ordinance is generous by comparison.169 Thus, the right to conduct STRs within those districts will be valid under either a nonconforming use theory (the city’s scheme permitted commercial use, or did not regulate use, before passing an ordinance permitting only residential use) or because the city issued the property owner a permit to conduct STRs, which cannot be subsequently withdrawn arbitrarily.170 B. STRS CAN BE CONSIDERED ACCESSORY, RESIDENTIAL, OR COMMERCIAL USE AND AMBIGUITIES ARE RESOLVED ON INCONSISTENT BASES No unifying legal theory on how to classify STR use has emerged in the wake of the sharing economy revolution.171 Some courts have maintained outright bans on rentals,172 whereas other courts have held, or at least suggested in dicta, that there is nothing inconsistent about STRs and single-family residential use.173 Courts and cities alike have asserted a range of legal interpretations that include accessory, residential, and commercial use.174 In other words, STR use is whatever the city says it is. Even when a court has found that STR use could be construed as consistent with single-family use, this was only because the city failed to clearly specify otherwise in its zoning ordinance.175 For example, in Marchenko v. Zoning Hearing Board, a host in Monroe County, Pennsylvania utilized her personal residence under a home-sharing model and was present or easily reachable for the duration of the guest’s stay.176 The ordinance at issue defined a “single-family dwelling” as one “occupied exclusively by one family,” and Pennsylvania had case law stating that as long as any use for 2017] transient purposes was not “purely transient,” STR use could be permitted under the meaning of single-family use.177 Hence, Marchenko’s use of her home under the home-sharing model did not exceed the scope of how Pennsylvania would construe the meaning of single-family use unless the city set out additional qualification of the use in the ordinance.178 The Pennsylvania approach is similar to how a court will normally view STR activity as an accessory use—one incidental and secondary to the principal use179—or more traditionally, “boarding.”180 The general rule for boarding as an accessory use is that the use must be proportional to that exercised by the principal resident—when the boarding use exceeds that limit, the use becomes commercial.181 On the contrary, the Indiana Supreme Court found language similar to that at issue in Marchenko enough to construe a host’s rental activity as commercial and not consistent with single-family residential use.182 The ordinance at issue in Siwinksi v. Town of Ogden Dunes defined commercial use as “any activity conducted for profit or gain” and single-family dwellings as “occupied exclusively as a residence by one family.”183 Defendant homeowner argued that because at any given time only one family occupied the residence, the defendant did not violate the ordinance.184 The court rejected this argument because it found the hosts were engaged in a commercial use since the residence was not occupied “exclusively” by a single family, but instead occupied sometimes by the owners and at other times by the renters.185 Furthermore, the owners conceded that they derived a profit from this use, and it was therefore commercial for that reason as well.186 How can almost identical language result in such drastically different results? The differences between Marchenko and Siwinski can be explained by the different canons of construction used by the Pennsylvania and Indiana Supreme Courts.187 Whereas the Indiana Supreme Court was guided by legislative intent in deciding how to read the zoning ordinance,188 the Pennsylvania courts broadly construe zoning terms to maximize property owners’ freedom within the meaning of the ordinance.189 Thus, whether STRs will be permissible within a residential district comes down to not only the language the city writes into the ordinance, but also which canon of construction the court will apply to the language. Will the court consider the intent of the drafter or give the ordinance a broad construction?190 In Texas, courts will be more likely to take an approach like that in Pennsylvania and construe restrictions on property owners narrowly while construing permissive language broadly because zoning regulations “are in derogation of common-law rights to use property.”191 In deciding how to litigate STR claims against a city, it is imperative for advocates to understand their state’s approach to statutory construction of zoning ordinances. Because Texas’s strict construction of zoning laws tends to maximize the freedom of property owners, STR advocates in Austin have one more legal arrow they can place in their quiver.192 However, because Austin has drafted a more precise set of requirements to regulate its STR permit holders,193 only those with valid nonconforming uses or who were previously issued permits are likely to have viable claims against the city.194 The residential versus commercial distinction, while providing courts with an easy mechanism for declaring STR use to be lawful or illegal, does not adequately balance the prerogatives of the city with the recognition of individual property rights. As this Comment asserts in Part I, supra, the way forward is for cities to take a more functional approach in drafting ordinances to account for the variable impact that different kinds of STR use have on a neighborhood. This can be done by allowing for free use of home sharing while restricting the number of transient renters, who are generally unaccountable for their guests.195 Curbing transient rentals will remain a due process issue because property owners will still seek to challenge such restrictions. In the next Part, this Comment will address many of the policy arguments that have been asserted as justification for regulating STRs and analyzes their merits against the backdrop 2017] of the enforcement challenges nearly all cities have faced with the emergence of the sharing economy. CITIES HAVE ASSERTED A RANGE OF POLICY JUSTIFICATIONS FOR BRINGING STRs INTO THE REGULATORY FOLD Zoning ordinances are presumed valid as long as they are substantially related to the “public health, safety, morals, or general welfare” of the communities they regulate.196 In the context of STR regulations, cities have asserted several justifications in either prohibiting STR use or implementing a permitting scheme.197 Cities claim that tougher regulations are necessary to deal with nuisances, such as loud parties, associated with some STR guests198—this has also been referred to as the nebulous “neighborhood character” justification.199 Other policy arguments include the preservation of affordable housing,200 safety of residences and guests alike,201 and the generation of transient occupancy tax revenue.202 The policy arguments with the strongest legal force, interestingly, appear to be preservation of neighborhood character and tax generation whereas the other policy arguments have had less legal or empirical force. PRESERVATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A VALID EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER As Ewing v. City of Carmel-By-The-Sea correctly observed, there is strong Supreme Court precedent favoring the municipality’s capacity to preserve neighborhood character.203 This ideal encompasses things such as aesthetics and prevention of nuisances so that “family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.”204 The Ewing court found that the city could validly restrict the occupation of homes in a residential area to those staying longer than thirty days, even if such people were not causing nuisances, because only permanent residents have a stake in the community and stick around long enough to get involved in things like “volunteer[ing] at the library” or “lead[ing] a Scout troop.”205 The court also recognized that the city was not trying to simply ban outsiders or visitors from coming to their city, it was only seeking to confine such activity to commercial areas.206 Although such standards as “neighborhood character” can often be hard to define—and should therefore present concerns for any legal scholar—judges (even Supreme Court Justices) and city officials often find these appeals persuasive. The Austin City Council was probably influenced most by a desire to preserve neighborhood character in passing its STR ordinance when it listened to its citizens at the public hearings.207 Even still, under Texas law, “[t]he existence of a nuisance is not a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of zoning regulations.”208 Therefore, cities need not wait for the nuisance to present itself before enacting zoning ordinances to place reasonable limits on transient renting. B. DISRUPTION OF TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES WILL SPAWN NEW FORMS OF TAXATION STR activity, especially with the ease of transaction brought about by Airbnb and other platforms, has made a tremendous impact on our economy.209 The platforms have clearly benefited the everyday consumer, who may now be able to afford lodging in an expensive city where before a hotel room was prohibitively expensive.210 But platforms have also disrupted the traditional hotel industry.211 Cities notice this effect most in the accompanying loss of tax revenue,212 and traditional hotels often complain of the unfair effect of having to compete with an industry peer that is not subject to regulation such as the transient occupancy tax.213 The ability of the city to collect this missing tax revenue, however, depends on the ability to enforce permitting schemes by locating and investigating defiant (or ignorant) hosts. Airbnb claims to be supportive of requiring its hosts to pay their fair share of taxes and asserts its amenability to working with cities in this endeavor,214 but this may only be true to a certain degree.215 Airbnb was embroiled in a high-profile dispute with New York’s Attorney General over a subpoena requesting host information so that authorities could enforce the ban on STRs in class A dwellings.216 But Airbnb prevailed in the trial court below and was not required to disclose host information that authorities were unable to glean from the bare online listings.217 Although the city could not sub206.

Ct. 2014). 216. Id. at 793. 217. Id. 2017] poena Airbnb for host information in New York City, the federal court in the Northern District of California held that San Francisco could fine Airbnb for collecting a fee from hosts who were found to be in violation of the city’s permitting requirement.218 Despite the success in the San Francisco case, the practical reality is that cities attempting to enforce permitting schemes, host presence requirements, or general prohibitions face an impossible task in eradicating all illegal forms of STR use.219 Even if the city wanted to ban STRs altogether, the use would probably continue in large numbers despite enforcement efforts. The city therefore has a much stronger incentive to utilize a permit scheme to (a) control the prevalence of STR use in particular zones, and (b) collect tax revenue it would otherwise lose if there were an outright prohibition. C. GUEST SAFETY IS A TENUOUS POLICY JUSTIFICATION As this Comment explained in Part I, New York City authorities face unique challenges in seeking to create the safest and healthiest environment in a city of millions of people living literally on top of each other. In Brookford, LLC v. Penraat, the court explained as much and elaborated that, unlike as required in the city’s hotels and other regulated lodging facilities, Class A dwellings used for STRs do not meet the same high level of code specifications for ensuring fire safety.220 Unlike all of the other cases discussed in this Comment, Penraat concerned a landlord-tenant dispute where the landlord sought to enjoin his tenant from engaging in STRs in violation of the MDL.221 The court found that the defendant’s activities were a threat to the safety of not only the guests but also the permanent residents of the building who “must endure the inconvenience of hotel occupancy in their buildings.”222 The concern of fire code safety was also integral to the New York Attorney General’s report, which included an affidavit and statistics of fire department and code officials in support of the findings.223 While these findings showed that fire safety code requirements were a necessary response to deadly incidents in New York’s past, and likely saved hundreds of lives over the past decades, the report did not include any incidents of STR guests being harmed as a result of their presence in a Class A dwelling.224 The safety justification is not as persuasive as other reasons asserted in favor of STR intervention. It seems unlikely that an STR guest, using an apartment in nearly the same manner as the permanent occupant would, is at any greater risk of dying in a fire than any of the other residents or children living in the building. This is not to say, however, that if an owner deliberately modifies the dwelling so as to violate existing codes and to maximize the usable space for STRs, a significant fire risk would not be created. D. LITTLE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT RISE OF STRS HAS IMPACTED THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING Proponents of stricter regulations for STR activity have asserted the affordable housing argument in Austin,225 New York,226 and the Los Angeles area.227 The argument goes like this: if people owning several pieces of valuable real-estate are allowed to use those properties for the more profitable enterprise of transient renting, then the long-term residents of the city are harmed because there are then fewer units available and the corresponding effect is a rise in the price of rent.228 Another possible effect is that people living in the more upscale residential neighborhoods see a drop in their property values because a neighbor uses the property for STRs, resulting in a higher transient presence in the neighborhood. On the other hand, STR advocates such as Airbnb and others deny that STR use has any effect on affordable housing, and they assert that the real effect is actually to the contrary—under a home-sharing model, a person could earn extra income to enable the person to meet increasing costs of living.229 But the consensus appears to be that any number of factors might affect the availability of affordable housing in a city, as even the National League of Cities conceded, and, therefore, more research is needed to determine what, if any, impact there is.230 CONCLUSION Internet-based short-term rentals have changed many lives for the better: certainly the platforms themselves have been enriched, hosts can now derive income where before they may not have been able to, and guests as consumers now have alternatives for accommodation when they travel at lower price points. But the new economic order did not emerge without resistance from those who may have been affected negatively. The person whose next-door neighbor abuses his STR permit by renting to thirty guests in a single-family home, the budget motel owner who saw his market share challenged, or the landlord whose tenant violates the lease are each potential victims. Professor Zale tells us that the commercial/noncommercial distinction applies in a wide array of legal contexts concerning the sharing economy but that a clear point at which to draw the line has eluded us.231 As we saw with the case studies in Part I, cities will continue to struggle to find the sweet spot of protecting the property rights of citizens while protecting the quality of life of their neighbors, with some jurisdictions skewing more to one side than the other.232 Cities attempting to take bold stances against STR use may get themselves into trouble with regulatory taking claims and, therefore, they should be mindful of pre-existing property rights.233 Although municipalities have a high level of deference in zoning decisions, a litigator might prevail over new STR regulations by attacking their drafting errors.234 This Comment has argued that while the authority to enact zoning laws to restrict STRs is extensive, it should be exercised in a way that addresses the complexity of the phenomenon. As shown, a failure to do so results in either constitutional challenges or void ordinances, which send underpaid and overworked city attorneys back to the drawing board. The City of Austin has taken some of the right steps even if, in other regards, the ordinance may be unconstitutional. Austin’s STR ordinance is useful in that it recognizes the gradients of use that are comparable to the three models this Comment proposes: it more heavily restricts Type II uses— transient rentals—than Type I home-sharing rentals.235 This is the best way to ensure that those with the most accountability are given the most leeway in conducting STRs with minimal impact, whereas those who are largely detached from the community can only profit by renting an income property to a long-term resident. Only by more thoroughly accounting for the new ways in which property owners are using their homes will cities be able to find their way forward in solving the STR controversy.

No federal official at any level is currently allowed to say Merry Christmas.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-no-federal-official-allowed-say/,False,False,False,False,False,False,"While it’s true that the intersection of religion, the workplace, and the federal government is legally tricky due to issues surrounding the separation of church and state, it is ridiculously false to say that ""no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’"" Guidelines in force for the past 15 years give substantial freedom for personal religious expression in the federal workplace, and neither those guidelines nor federal law includes anything like an outright ban on a federal official saying, ""Merry Christmas.""",Newt Gingrich says no federal official is allowed to say,"Newt Gingrich says the nation's obsession with being politically correct has come to this: Federal officials aren't allowed to say Merry Christmas.  On the campaign trail, Gingrich has offered strong criticism of efforts to keep religion out of public places and said he would hold judges to account if they rule in favor of stricter separation between church and state. The topic came up in Davenport, Iowa, on Dec. 19, 2011. The question wasn’t audible on a video clip, but here's Gingrich's reply:  This is actually weird . . . I’ve been investigating this for the last three days. I am told that this is actually a 20- or 30-year-old law, which I have to say I find strange, and I would advocate repealing the law. Apparently if the president sends out Christmas cards, they are paid for the Democratic or Republican National Committees because no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’ And the idea, I think, is that the government should be neutral. … I'm going to go back and find out how was this law written, when was it passed. We’ve had this whole — in my mind — very destructive attitude in the last 50 years that we have to drive religion out of public life.  A reader brought this to our attention, so we decided to look into whether Gingrich is right that no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’  First off, we’ll grant a little leeway in Gingrich’s wording. The United States government does not, as a general matter, monitor and control employees' private conversations, so we’ll assume that Gingrich isn't suggesting that if a federal bureaucrat is in the comfort of their home, they can't wish a neighbor Merry Christmas.  But what about in the workplace? If a federal worker wishes to say that to a colleague, do they get reprimanded?  To explore this, we examined federal rules, spoke with labor unions that represent government workers and interviewed lawyers with expertise in federal rules. The upshot: It's perfectly acceptable to say Merry Christmas! (Or Happy Hanukkah!)  We started with Memorandum on Religious Exercise and Religious Expression in the Federal Workplace, issued Aug. 14, 1997, by President Bill Clinton. We found the rule was respectful of employees' rights to express their religious preference:  First, agencies shall permit employees to engage in personal religious expression (as they must permit other constitutionally valued expression) to the greatest extent possible, consistent with interests in workplace efficiency and requirements of law. Of course, the workplace is for work, and an agency may restrict any speech that truly interferes with its ability to perform public services. In addition, an agency may have a legal obligation to restrict certain forms of speech that intrude unduly on the legitimate rights of others. But when an agency allows nonreligious speech, because that speech does not impinge on these interests, an agency also usually must allow otherwise similar speech of a religious nature. The one exception to this principle of neutrality—an exception mandated by the Establishment Clause—is when religious speech would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that the Government is endorsing religion. Subject to this exception, an agency may not typically subject religious speech to greater restrictions than other speech entitled to full constitutional protection, and therefore should allow much of this speech to go forward.  While there is some gray area in that passage, there’s nothing as sweeping as Gingrich claims, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in church-state issues.  Indeed, the more detailed rules affiliated with this memorandum suggest quite the opposite. Among the theoretical examples provided is this one: At Christmas time, a supervisor places a wreath over the entrance to the office's main reception area. This course of conduct is permitted.  Laycock added that there is no such law anywhere in the United States Code. There is no such regulation of sufficient status to appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. I am certain of these two facts, because they are both computer-searchable. … It is hard to imagine a rule that applies to every ‘federal official at any level’ not appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor and another specialist in church-state issues, agreed. I’m not aware of any general prohibition on federal workers, in private or on the job, saying the words, 'Merry Christmas.'   We also checked with the American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union for federal workers. A spokeswoman said she checked with the union’s legal staff and they confirmed the view that federal workers are allowed to say Merry Christmas.  John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a group that promotes careers in government, said the notion that any other federal official is prohibited by law from saying ‘Merry Christmas’ is absurd.  So where did Gingrich’s falsehood come from? The Gingrich campaign hasn't been responding to our inquiries, but it appears to be rooted in two things -- the White House tradition of using political parties to pay for the White House Christmas card, and the rules for congressional postage.  On White House Christmas cards, Gingrich has a point. The White House has long avoided the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for the Christmas cards it sends out, said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written about the issue. Instead, political party committees foot the bill.  But this appears to be a longstanding custom that began decades ago out of an abundance of caution, not because federal law bans the practice outright. The legal concerns that prompted the initial decision may have involved the separation of church and state, as well as concerns that the holiday cards would be viewed as political in nature, possibly implicating laws against the use of federal funds for campaign purposes, said Robert K. Kelner, a lawyer who specializes in political and election law at the firm Covington & Burling.  Joe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said that in recent years, the White House cards have been generally nonsectarian in character, probably because candidates of both parties happily take contributions from donors of all faiths and none. And they don’t want to turn off any potential contributors.  We checked transcripts of speeches by federal officials and quickly found plenty of examples of Christmas wishes:  • Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! -- President Barack Obama, Dec. 1, 2011  • Merry Christmas and happy holidays, everybody. -- Obama, Dec. 13, 2010  • Merry Christmas to my constituents, as I’ve said, and Merry Christmas to our first family and all that they have done for America. -- Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, Dec. 16, 2009  • Merry Christmas to everyone. I reserve the balance of my time. -- U.S. Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., Dec. 16, 2009  Gingrich's more sweeping claim fits into the annual complaint by Fox News commentators and other conservatives that there is a war on Christmas. This year, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner said the U.S. House of Representatives has banned wishing constituents a ‘Merry Christmas’ if they want to do so in a mailing paid for with tax dollars.  Mark Tapscott, who edits the newspaper’s editorial page, wrote that Members who submit official mailings for review by the congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it can be ‘franked,’ or paid for with tax dollars, are being told that no holiday greetings, including ‘Merry Christmas,’ can be sent in official mail.  Tapscott quoted a Capitol Hill staffer who requested anonymity saying, I called the commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy new year' – referencing the time period of a new year, but not the holiday.  The column goes on to cite a Dec. 12, 2011, memo from the Franking Commission Staff concerning Holiday Messaging.  According to the column, the memo said that examples of nonfrankable items include birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings. … You may make reference to the season as a whole using language along the lines of, 'Have a safe and happy holiday season.' It may only be incidental to the piece rather than the primary purpose of the communication. (This rule was subsequently mocked by Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly here.)  We weren’t able to independently obtain the memo from the House Administration committee, nor speak to a spokesperson for the committee. But we did look up the House’s official franking rulebook at the committee’s website, and it closely follows the language of the memo obtained by the Examiner, saying that birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings are prohibited.  We also checked the Senate guidelines, which are broadly similar. The Senate prohibits the use of the frank for ‘any card expressing holiday greetings from (a Senator).’ This prohibition extends to acknowledgments of holiday greetings sent to a Senator, but does not preclude an expression of holiday greetings at the commencement or conclusion of otherwise frankable correspondence.  So both the House and Senate -- whose employees are federal workers -- do restrict the use of taxpayer funds for sending out holiday cards, as well as birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement and condolence cards. So this is not a war on Christmas. It's more like a war on … greeting cards.  From that rule, it's a ridiculous leap to Gingrich’s claim that no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’  Here’s the kicker: The House regulations that sparked Gingrich’s outrage are dated June 1998, when the House Speaker was … Newt Gingrich. And the present Republican speaker, John Boehner of Ohio, was on the committee that directly wrote the rules.  Our rating  While it’s true that the intersection of religion, the workplace, and the federal government is legally tricky due to issues surrounding the separation of church and state, it is ridiculously false to say that no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’ Guidelines in force for the past 15 years give substantial freedom for personal religious expression in the federal workplace, and neither those guidelines nor federal law includes anything like an outright ban on a federal official saying, Merry Christmas.  The closest Gingrich comes to accuracy is that Congress does bar taxpayer-funded official mailings of all types of cards. However, such rules affect only one class of federal employees (those who serve in Congress); the rules are only about postage (lawmakers are free to send cards on their own dime); and it certainly does not abridge the right of any Member of Congress or congressional employee to speak the words Merry Christmas.

I won't get into how silly the whole argument is, but I will say this: you have a legal right to not have your employer force you to celebrate a particular holiday. If you don't celebrate Christmas, you probably don't have to spout Christmas greetings to your customers and coworkers.If you do celebrate Christmas, then please don't forget that there are many other religious holidays being celebrated in December. Some of your customers and coworkers may not want to have Christmas shoved down their throats. I've actually heard retail clerks carry on loud conversations in front of customers about how they are going to say, Merry Christmas, and that anyone who doesn't is part of the war on Christmas. I'm offended by that and I do celebrate Christmas. Imagine how offensive that is to a customer who celebrates a different holiday than yours. Why not say, Happy Holidays, and include everyone in your greeting?Here's just a partial list of the holidays other than Christmas being celebrated this month:As to your rights at work, the holidays are one of those times that bring religious discrimination suits by the boatload. Here are some of the ways you may be subjected to illegal discrimination at work this month:Merry Christmas: If your boss forces you to use a religious greeting to customers, you have the right to say no, unless your job really does require you to do so. Obviously, if your job is department store Santa, you have to say it. But a retail clerk does not. Nobody who doesn't celebrate a religious holiday should have to use religious greetings. Some Christians, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, don't celebrate any holidays, so even Christians should not be forced to use the greeting if it is against their religious beliefs. On the other hand, while your boss can probably ask you to use a more generic greeting to customers, they probably can't prohibit you from using the greeting with people you are certain also celebrate the holiday.Office parties: Your boss shouldn't pressure you to attend the office holiday party. Many people don't celebrate holidays at all, and some just don't want to attend a party associated with Christmas even if the company tries to keep it more generic. Another good reason not to force employees to attend is they could have a disability that prevents them from attending. Forcing people to attend parties is a good way to end up explaining to EEOC in 2016.Costumes: If your boss tries to make you dress up like Santa, an elf, the Grinch or another holiday figure, you can say no if it's against your religious beliefs. Plus, forcing the oldest employee to dress like Santa because he has gray hair is an age discrimination suit waiting to happen.Decorations: I don't care if your department is in a company-wide decoration contest. If you let them know that you don't want to participate, nobody should force you. And nobody should decorate your desk when you step away for a minute. You can say no to decorations.Time off to celebrate: Whatever your religious holiday, your religious beliefs should be accommodated. You can reasonably ask for time off to celebrate your holiday. Unless there's some hardship the employer will suffer by granting the accommodation, they have to let you take your holiday off.If you are being forced to participate in a religious celebration, you can ask for a religious accommodation to be excused from it. If you need to do something to celebrate your religious holiday, such as time off or wearing something specific, you also have the right to ask for a religious accommodation. I suggest putting any accommodation request in writing to HR so you have proof you said it was a religious accommodation.If your employer denies a reasonable religious accommodation, contact an employee-side employment lawyer in your state or EEOC to find out about your rights.For more information about employment law issues, check out Donna Ballman's award-winning employee-side employment law blog, Screw You Guys, I'm Going Home and her employment law articles at AOL Jobs.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/donna-ballman/happy-holidays-instead-of_1_b_8859118.html,
No federal official at any level is currently allowed to say Merry Christmas.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-no-federal-official-allowed-say/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,How the ‘War on Christmas’ Controversy Was Created,"It’s that time of year again, folks. It’s time for the War on Christmas.What is that, you may ask? The short answer: a sometimes histrionic yuletide debate over whether the United States is a country that respects Christianity.For the longer answer, keep reading.The idea of a “War on Christmas” has turned things like holiday greetings and decorations into potentially divisive political statements. People who believe Christmas is under attack point to inclusive phrases like “Happy Holidays” as (liberal) insults to Christianity.For over a decade, these debates have taken place mainly on conservative talk radio and cable programs. But this year they also burst onto a much grander stage: the presidential election.At a rally in Wisconsin last week, Donald J. Trump stood in front of a line of Christmas trees and repeated a campaign-trail staple.“When I started 18 months ago, I told my first crowd in Wisconsin that we are going to come back here some day and we are going to say ‘Merry Christmas’ again,” he said. “Merry Christmas. So, Merry Christmas everyone. Happy New Year, but Merry Christmas.”Christmas is a federal holiday celebrated widely by the country’s Christian majority. So where did the idea that it is threatened come from?What is the “War on Christmas”?The most organized attack on Christmas came from the Puritans, who banned celebrations of the holiday in the 17th century because it did not accord with their interpretation of the Bible.Fast forward 400 years, and the idea of a plot against Christmas gained wide publicity when Fox News promoted a 2005 book by a radio host, John Gibson, that alleged liberal antagonism toward the holiday, according to Dan Cassino, a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University.Mr. Gibson said in an interview that he was “amazed” by the uproar his book caused.He said it primarily focused on an issue that rarely happens anymore: educators and local officials banning nonreligious symbols like Santa Claus or Christmas trees out of a mistaken belief that displaying them violated the Constitution.Mr. Gibson said the book had taken on a life of its own over the years — and that it had never dwelled on the political implications of “Happy Holidays.”He attributed the firestorm to two things: The book’s take-no-prisoner’s title (“The War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought”) and the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly.“It wasn’t really me. I think it was more Bill, to tell you the truth,” he said. “When Bill made it an issue, it went mega.”Indeed, Mr. O’Reilly has returned to the theme of a war on Christmas again and again over the years. In 2012 he told viewers that liberals were “tying the Christmas situation into secular progressive politics” because they wanted “a new America, and traditional Christmas isn’t a part of it.”That argument became a sweeping shorthand for conservative anxieties, Mr. Cassino said.“They say the next step after saying ‘Happy Holidays’ is abortion on demand and euthanasia,” he said. “That’s a hell of a slippery slope, but that’s the argument being made.”A study by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that watching Fox News increased the likelihood that someone would believe in the War on Christmas by 5 to 10 percent.Mr. O’Reilly returned to the War on Christmas this year, but his tone has been triumphant.“That culture war issue ignited and we won,” he said last Tuesday, later adding, “Donald Trump is on the case.”Is this a real thing?There is no evidence of an organized attack on Christmas in the United States.The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the annual uproar is based on “stories that only sometimes even contain a grain of truth and often are completely false.” He has spent years pushing back against it.“This politicizing of the whole issue is mind-boggling to me,” Mr. Lynn said, “and it has been for well over a decade.”He added, “They see this as some kind of a politically correct effort, but I see it as reasonable to not use Christmas references as just an accommodation of the reality of America.”People who believe Christmas is under attack often blame the American Civil Liberties Union. Earlier this month, the A.C.L.U. in Indiana filed a lawsuit on behalf of a resident of Knightstown, Ind., who objected to a Latin cross displayed atop the town’s official Christmas tree. The cross was removed.Daniel Mach, director of the A.C.L.U. program on freedom of religion and belief, said his organization has also defended people’s right to engage in Christmas-related activity, including a Pennsylvania inmate who wanted to organize a communal prayer.“Christmas celebrations in this country are alive and well,” Mr. Mach said. “And as long as the government itself isn’t promoting religious doctrine those celebrations are entirely constitutional.”What does the “war” look like in practice?Many conservative groups have rallied to defend Christmas, lobbying for decorations in public schools or town halls. One group, the American Family Association based in Tupelo, Miss., publishes a “Naughty and Nice” list every year to castigate companies it believes are ""censoring ‘Christmas.’ ”“There are secular forces in our country that hate Christmas because the word itself is a reminder of Jesus Christ,” the group said on its website. “They want to eradicate anything that reminds Americans of Christianity.”Entries on the 2016 naughty list include Barnes & Noble, Best Buy and Victoria’s Secret. Starbucks has come under fire for several years for seasonal cup designs that emphasize winter weather or social harmony over Christmas greetings.“Maybe we should boycott Starbucks?” he said.Mr. Cassino said the boycott calls have had some success in pressuring businesses. “Retailers are taking this seriously, and thinking about these issues in a way they never did before,” he said.“Merry Christmas” or “Happy Holidays”?The greeting “Happy Holidays” has been in use as a Christmas greeting for more than 100 years. But it has grown in popularity in recent decades as people have tried to be inclusive and sensitive to those of other faiths and the nonreligious.The controversy appears to have shifted opinion about the proper greeting. Mr. Cassino wrote in the Harvard Business Review this month that the number of people who said they preferred to to hear “Happy Holidays” has decreased sharply in the last 10 years, from 41 percent to 25 percent. “Merry Christmas” remained popular. Indeed, President Obama, a Christian, has frequently uttered the phrase.It should be noted that Jews, Muslims and others who do not celebrate Christmas often say they are not offended by a hearty “Merry Christmas.”So perhaps there is hope for peace on earth, or at least cable television.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/us/war-on-christmas-controversy.html,
No federal official at any level is currently allowed to say Merry Christmas.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-no-federal-official-allowed-say/,False,False,False,False,False,Unrelated,,FALSE: Military Can't Say 'Christmas' per Obama Order,"Claim:  President Obama has issued an order banning U.S. military personnel from using the word “Christmas.”Example: [Collected via e-mail and Twitter, November 2015]Origins: On 14 November 2015 the web site Truth and Action published an article headlined “MILITARY CAN’T SAY CHRISTMAS PER OBAMA ORDER,” claiming the President had issued a directive creating a “blanket ban” on U.S. military personnel exchanging Yuletide greetings or making any other mention of the word “Christmas”:The Obama administration has directed the military to not allow personnel to say “Christmas,” in spite of the holiday’s status as a federally-recognized holiday. The reason given by armed forces officials is that not everyone celebrates Christmas and that out of respect for them, military members should refer to Christmas celebrations simply as “holiday”-themed festivities. This prohibition comes in the context of a wider push for political correctness in society in general and the military in particular, as evidenced by the recent reprimanding of Navy Chaplain Wes Modder for simply discussing religion, as chaplains are wont to do, with military personnel. This blanket ban on Christmas in the military has apparently been in the works for sometime.Precisely when the “order” was issued, its specific provisions, its scope, and other incredibly basic details were suspiciously absent from the article (and subsequent iterations of the same claim). Truth and Action cited Coach is Right as the source for their claims, linking to a 7 November 2015 post titled “MILITARY MEMBERS NOT PERMITTED TO SAY ‘CHRISTMAS,’ MENTION RELIGION PER OBAMA ORDER” which held that:Being the Christmas season it seems the right time to recall one of Barack’s most despicable slaps against the Christian faith to which he has falsely claimed allegiance throughout his political career. It took place in 2013 at Camp Shelby in Mississippi. During a pre-Christmas meeting with members of the 158th Infantry Brigade, the discussion turned to the upcoming Christmas football tournament. According to a soldier present at the meeting, it was at this point that “the equal opportunity representative stopped the briefing and told us that we can’t say Christmas.” This PC lunatic continued on, “[telling] our commander that not everyone celebrates Christmas and we couldn’t say Christmas celebration. It had to be holiday celebration.” And this was no simple suggestion. It was an order — that is a threat, backed up by Military “Justice” as necessary.Already, we’ve gone from “President Obama issued an order prohibiting military personnel from saying the word Christmas” to “two years ago, an unnamed soldier (who may or may not exist) claimed that a third party who was not President Obama told him soldiers ‘can’t say Christmas.'” Between 7 November 2015 and 14 November 2015, the tale evolved from a secondhand anecdote which has in no way been borne out in the two years since it first appeared to a novel order issued by President Obama informally known as “The Grinch Act.”Coach is Right in turn linked to a 24 December 2013 article by Fox News “War on Christmas” correspondent Todd Starnes titled “Army: Don’t Say Christmas.” Starnes’ piece (published on Christmas Eve) focused on a purported conversation between soldiers planning a holiday football game and an equal opportunity officer from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI), not President Obama). According to that 2013 article, the supposed dispute didn’t even pertain to a “blanket ban” on use of the word “Christmas,” but rather whether the Army could endorse a Christian-specific event:That’s the message that was conveyed to a group of soldiers at Camp Shelby by an equal opportunity officer from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, according to a soldier who attended a recent briefing. [In December 2013], a routine meeting was held at the Mississippi base with various leaders of the 158th Infantry Brigade. During the meeting, they discussed an upcoming Christmas football tournament. The equal opportunity officer immediately objected to the usage of the word “Christmas.” “Our equal opportunity representative stopped the briefing and told us that we can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me. “Almost the entire room blew up. Everybody was frustrated. The equal opportunity rep told our commander that not everyone celebrates Christmas and we couldn’t say Christmas celebration. It had to be holiday celebration.” [T]he equal opportunity representative tried to deflect the criticism by pointing out it was the Army’s rules — not hers.. “She said an individual can say Christmas, but as an organization in the Army you can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me.As Starnes’ own article asserted, the military itself maintained longstanding policies prohibiting its branches from endorsing any specific religion. The policies were in place well before President Obama was elected, and in 2014 Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen commented on a separate claim of religious persecution fronted by the same columnist:The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs.  The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense.The relevant policy expressly referenced the Constitution’s provisions prohibiting the establishment of an official, government-endorsed religion:Leaders at all levels must balance constitutional protections for an individual’s free exercise of religion or other personal beliefs and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. For example, they must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion. Commanders or supervisors who engage in such behavior may cause members to doubt their impartiality and objectivity. The potential result is a degradation of the unit’s morale, good order, and discipline.Starnes’ 2013 article included comment from an Army spokeswoman who expressly confirmed that there was no ban on the word Christmas:In summary, President Obama did not issue a “blanket ban” on the word Christmas for military servicemen in November 2015 or at any other time. In 2013, a DEOMI officer recommended soldiers at Camp Shelby call a Christmas event a “holiday game,” due to a longstanding Department of Defense general policy about the armed forces not endorsing any specific religion. The then-exaggerated claim was revived in 2015, but at no point has use of the word “Christmas” been banned in the military.",https://www.snopes.com/obama-military-christmas-ban/,

For several decade now the term “Christmas” or any of its religious aspects have been increasingly censored, avoided, or discouraged by many advertisers, retailers, government, and other public organizations. But just how much trouble can you really get into for acknowledging the Christian holiday?Last year, members the House of Representatives were told not to send out holiday greetings including the words “Merry Christmas” in official mailing.  This year North Carolina college students selling Christmas trees for charity were surprised when the college changed all advertising from “Christmas trees” to “holiday trees,” allegedly saying that, “We cannot market your trees in association solely with a Christian event.”While the Religious News Service reported that 9 out of 10 Americans plan to celebrate Christmas in 2011, the Religion News Poll found that Americans were split — 44 percent in favor and 49 opposed–on whether retailers should use generic holiday greetings out of respect for people of different faiths. On the other hand, another poll this year shows that 68 percent of shoppers prefer to be greeted with “Merry Christmas” rather than “Happy Holidays,” so it depends on who you ask.If your boss can fire you for not following seemingly trivial company rules — shaving your beard, wearing a collared shirt, or not chewing gum — you can bet they can fire you for saying “Merry Christmas” if asked not to. And while firing an atheist who refuses to dress up like an elf and say “Happy Holidays!” to customers might seem discriminatory, suing for wrongful termination could be tricky.While a Florida state law making it illegal to blast loud music from a car stereo was recently declared unconstitutional for violating free speech rights, a friendly Christmas greeting can legally get you fired if your employer has made it clear that it is not permissible. While it is not illegal to say “Merry Christmas,” (that would violate the First Amendment), your boss can ask you not to say it out of respect for non-Christian customers or coworkers.Christmas Day is recognized as an official federal holiday by the United States government; however, many groups — such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State — argue that government-funded displays of Christmas imagery and traditions violate the First Amendment since it promotes Christianity. The battle over whether the long-held tradition of holding public Christmas nativity displays should be banned has become rather heated as of late, and the city of Santa Monica has decided to end the tradition of having such displays in Palisades Park. Recently, an Arkansas elementary school took a heap of heat from angry parents opposing a field trip to see a stage production of A Charlie Brown Christmas at a church.While many retailers have removed Christmas from their advertising do so simply to not offend those who celebrate Hanukkah, Kwanza, or other associated holidays, some major retailers — who are aware that many Christians boycott stores who refuse to acknowledge Christmas — very boldly display the words “Merry Christmas!” in their advertising. The American Family Association provides a new “Naughty or Nice?” list every year listing retailers who do and don’t recognize Christmas; it appears that this year Walmart, Target, Lowe’s, Sears, and Best Buy are considered Christmas-friendly, while GAP and Old Navy are encouraged to be boycotted by the list.Some believe the so-called “War on Christmas” may be dying down a bit, at least since the popularity of news articles on the subject have dwindled on Google since 2005 — the same year the Capitol Hill tree was renamed the “Capitol Hill Christmas Tree” after being called a “holiday tree” since the 1990s. At any rate, it’s likely there will be controversy over the use of “Merry Christmas” and “Happy Holidays” on both sides for years to come.",http://stories.avvo.com/nakedlaw/bizarre/can-you-get-in-trouble-for-saying-merry-christmas.html,

The “war on Christmas” trope seems to surface with Black Friday sales, but who is actually at war?It is easy to imagine saying “merry Christmas” as another cudgel in the culture wars between Christians and the irreligious. The actual story, however, is much more nuanced. Public Religion Research Institute asked a nationally representative sample of Americans whether retailers should greet their customers with “happy holidays” or “season’s greetings” — rather than “merry Christmas” — “out of respect for people of different faiths.” Although a slim majority of those with a preference want retailers to say “happy holidays” or “season’s greetings,” we found that preference depends on your level of tension with the culture where you live. To explore these cultural tensions, we analyzed the PRRI data jointly with the 2010 Religion Census results.According to the findings, evangelicals, on average, strongly favor “merry Christmas” and seculars prefer “happy holidays” or “season’s greetings.” But the war on Christmas is not simply a religious divide. One of the more surprising findings is that the Bible-Belt South does not show the weakest preference for “happy holidays” (54 percent). That distinction belongs to the Midwest (44 percent). One reason for the difference is African-Americans (20 percent of the South in this sample), who strongly prefer “happy holidays” despite their high levels of religiosity.Preferences, not surprisingly, are filtered through a political lens, with Republicans opposing “happy holidays” at the strongest rates and most consistently across the nation. Republican responses probably reflect opposition to political correctness as much as (and perhaps more so than) spiritual sympathies. Republicans as a whole (30 percent) outpace even evangelical Republicans (38 percent) in their anemic support for saying “happy holidays.”Since Christmas is such a public holiday — people put out displays and pass out cookies, and they feel compelled to wish people some version of merriment — it is no surprise that reactions to it vary across communities. Non-Christians and the nonreligious in states with large white Christian populations are the most likely groups to urge stores to adopt a “happy holidays” regimen. Support for “happy holidays,” however, drops dramatically for secular citizens in largely nonreligious states like Oregon. In these areas, the social stakes are low — Christmas is not an entre to conversations about what church you attend, but more about presents, ugly sweaters and Santa. In such nonreligious states, seculars’ support for “happy holidays” is the same as it is among evangelicals nationwide (48 percent).The next time you hear or read a media dispatch about the war on Christmas, such as Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller’s threat to slap the next person who says “happy holidays” to him, realize that it does not reflect a national war but rather local skirmishes. There is no orchestrated war against saying “merry Christmas,” but it is important to recognize that Christmas can be a potent symbol that reflects intergroup tensions and signals exclusion to some Americans.",https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-to-say-merry-christmas-vs-happy-holidays/,

For instance the ACLU has claimed that nativity scenes in public places is a violation of the Constitution, and thus has attempted in the past to force places like courthouses to remove these displays.

""There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures.",Ann Coulter wrongly claims that U.S. 'has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population',"Ann Coulter’s new book argues that immigration is undermining the country, and she was delighted to give a full-throated defense of her stance in an interview with Univision and Fusion TV journalist Jorge Ramos. The two agreed on virtually nothing, including the most basic statistics.Ramos opened the segment of his show by telling Coulter that her facts on the number of undocumented immigrants were wrong. In her book, she claimed there are 30 million. The consensus figure is about 11 million. Coulter was unfased.You’re wrong, Coulter told Ramos. The number we keep hearing is 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. That’s so weird. It’s been 11 million for a decade. But as I explain in the book, they are all using the Census figures. If the Census figures are wrong, then everybody’s numbers are wrong.Coulter said there is absolutely no question that the number is at least 30 million. She said the work of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and a 2006 analysis by two Bear Stearns financial analysts supported her belief. We’ll touch on those items in a bit.But arguably Coulter’s biggest numerical claim was that America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population. She said it during her interview with Ramos and included it as a on her website.Several readers asked us to dig into that claim. We tried to reach Coulter through her publisher and other channels and did not hear back. However, she gives the source of her figure in her new book.Coulter zeros in on Mexico to undercut the argument that immigration promotes diversity. Diversity in immigration ought to mean every country on earth sends the same percentage of immigrants, she writes. In contrast, Mexico provides about a third of all immigrants, and that became her target.In a sub-section titled Doesn’t Mexico want any Mexicans? Coulter grounds her statement about America taking in one-quarter of Mexico’s population on a  analysis of census data. The top line number in that study finds that about 33.5 million people of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2011.Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people, and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has taken in one-quarter of the total.In reality, the immigration data from Pew is not nearly as neat and tidy as Coulter concludes. The Pew report attempted to count the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who came directly from that country.Why does that make such a difference?Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population.If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be taken in.The Pew definition is important, and if the numbers about Mexico don’t make it clear, let’s look at another country. We picked Ireland. In 2014, the Census Bureau said there were 34.1 million Americans with Irish roots. That’s nearly seven times Ireland’s current population.One could argue that if the parents hadn’t moved to the United States, the children wouldn’t have been born here. But Coulter offers no analysis and no data on that front. In her framework, a person whose family came from Mexico 70 years ago is just as much a Mexican as someone who arrived yesterday.According to the Census Bureau, about 10.5 million people of Mexican heritage come from families in which both parents were born in the United States. This group is at least second-generation American born.The Pew report found that about 11.6 million people of the 33.5 million total had been born in Mexico, including both authorized and unauthorized immigrants.Tangentially related to this fact-check is Coulter’s suggestion that groups are severely undercounting the number of unauthorized illegal immigrants based on census data.Coulter’s starting point is a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors . They set census data aside and looked at things like the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities with growing immigrant populations. The article said the increases were much larger than the official rise in population. The authors did not show how they reached their estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants, but they, and Coulter, emphasized that the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of.The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration much as Coulter does, disagrees with that last point.In a , the center wrote It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey.For illegals, we estimate 11 to 12 million with 50 to 60 percent from Mexico, said Steven Camarota, the center’s director of research.Jennifer Van Hook, who directs the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, said she believes the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States is 6.3 million-8.3 million. No matter how you slice it, Coulter’s claim doesn’t get any closer to true, she said.There is no way it is as high as 30 million, Van Hook said.The Migration Policy Institute estimates the total unauthorized population at 11 million. Director of research for American programs Randy Capps said figures produced by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey are just the starting point in determining that figure (the Census Bureau itself doesn't create a count). The final estimate reflects a hike of 20 to 25 percent to address the undercount of unauthorized immigrants in the ACS.Capps emphasized that his group, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies generally reach the same results because they all tweak the census data.All four of these sources incorporate an undercount of unauthorized immigrants ranging from 10 to 25 percent, Capps said.Capp’s counterpart at the Pew Research Center, Jeffrey Passel, rejected Coulter’s claim on both methodological and common sense grounds.It is simply not possible for there to be in excess of 30 million Mexican immigrants in the United States, Passel said. There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures.Coulter said that America has taken in one-quarter of the entire population of Mexico. Coulter based this on a study that counted all people of Mexican origin in the United States.But Coulter ignored that 65 percent of those were born in America and about a third came from families in which both parents were born in America. Their immigrant status lay at least two-generations in the past, and America couldn’t take them in because they were already here.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.Note: This claim was fact-checked as one of the donor-benefits tied to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

Ann Coulter sourced a  report in her book.So what’s Greenberg’s argument? He’s saying that Mexicans aren’t Mexican.In reality, the immigration data from Pew is not nearly as neat and tidy as Coulter concludes. The Pew report attempted to count the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who came directly from that country. Why does that make such a difference? Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population. If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be “taken in.”But they are Mexican. They say they’re Mexican, and the Government of Mexico thinks they’re Mexican. Many of the Mexicans born in the US are born to Mexican parents who are citizens of Mexico, and they can go to Mexico and claim citizenship there if they want.What we’re looking at is colonization. Citizens of Mexico move to the US, live in barrios and colonias, and raise their kids in America, and the so the Mexican population grows until the number of Mexicans in America is equal to, as Ann Coulter says, 25 percent of the population of Mexico.A much shorter answer to Greenberg  is the graph at the top of this post. In 1950, America had 4 million Hispanics. The difference between 1950 and 2015 is due to immigration, not natural increase.",http://www.vdare.com/posts/politfact-wrongly-claims-ann-coulter-is-wrong-about-america-absorbing-a-quarter-of-mexicos-population,

I have an explosive book on the No. 1 issue in the country coming out next week, I've already written 10 New York Times best-sellers (I'd be on a postage stamp if I were a liberal) but I can't get an interview on ABC, NBC or CBS.Only Mexican-born Jorge Ramos would interview me on his Fusion network. Yay, Jorge!After a spellbinding interview, Ramos ended by asking this excellent question -- which I had suggested myself for all authors, most of whom write very boring books, harming the marketability of my own books: Is there anything in your book that isn't already generally known?My soon-to-be-released book, Adios, America! The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, is jam-packed with facts you didn't already know. Don't even think of using it as a coaster, like those other books.These are just a few:-- Teddy Kennedy's 1965 Immigration Act was expressly designed to change the demographics of our country to be poorer and more inclined to vote Democratic.-- It worked! Post-1970 immigrants vote 8-2 for the Democrats.-- Citing this dramatic shift in the Democratic Party's fortunes, Democratic consultant Patrick Reddy called the 1965 Immigration Act the Kennedy family's greatest gift to the Democratic Party.-- Immigrants admitted before 1970 made more money, bought more houses and were more educated than Americans. The post-Kennedy immigrants are astronomically less-educated, poorer and more likely to be on welfare than the native population.-- With no welfare state to support them, about a third of pre-1965 Act immigrants returned to the places they came from. British and Jewish immigrants were the least likely to go home -- less than 10 percent did.-- Although America is admitting more immigrants, they are coming from fewer countries than they did before 1970. On liberals' own terms, the country is becoming less diverse, but a lot poorer and a whole lot more Latin.-- America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population.-- In 1970, there were almost no Nigerian immigrants in the United States. Our country is now home to more Nigerians than any country in the world except Nigeria.-- America takes more immigrants from Nigeria than from England.-- The government refuses to tell us how many prisoners in the United States are immigrants. That information is not available anywhere. But the ancillary facts suggest that the number is astronomical.-- There are more foreign inmates in New York state prisons from Mexico than from the entire continent of Europe.-- Hispanics are less likely to be in the military than either whites or blacks, and a majority of Hispanic troops are women. On the other hand, Hispanics are overrepresented in U.S. Prisons.-- In Denmark, actual Danes come in tenth in criminals' nationality, after Moroccans, Lebanese, Yugoslavians, Somalis, Iranians, Pakistanis, Turks, Iraqis and Vietnamese.-- At least 15 percent of all births in Peru and Argentina are to girls between the ages of 10 and 15. In the U.S., only 2 percent of births are to girls that young, and those are mostly Hispanics, who are seven times more likely to give birth at that age than white girls are.-- Sex with girls as young as 12 years old is legal in 31 of the 32 states of Mexico.-- In all of Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel combined, there have been eight reported births to girlsSeven of the eight were impregnated by immigrants.-- In some areas of America, law enforcement authorities have given up on prosecuting statutory rape cases against Mexican men in their 30s who impregnate 12- and 13-year-old girls, after repeatedly encountering parents who view their little girls' pregnancies as a blessing.-- The same North Carolina newspapers that gave flood-the-zone coverage to a rape that never happened at a Duke lacrosse party completely ignore real rapes happening right under their noses, being committed against children by immigrants providing cheap labor to the state's farming and meat-packing industries.-- Since 2004, Mexicans have beheaded at least a half-dozen people in the United States.-- Mexican drug cartels -- not ISIS -- pioneered the practice of posting videotaped beheadings online.-- An alleged ISIS beheading video making the rounds in 2014 was actually a Mexican beheading video from 2010.-- Post-1970 immigrants have re-introduced slavery to America. Indian immigrant Lakireddy Bali Reddy, for example, used the H1-B visa program, allegedly for high-tech workers,-- The above story was missed by the San Francisco Chronicle. It was broken by a high school journalism class.-- The ACLU took Reddy's side.-- We're still letting in Hmong immigrants as a reward for their help with the ill-fated Vietnam War, which ended 40 years ago.-- Between 2000 and 2005, nearly 100 Hmong men were charged with rape or forced prostitution of girls in Minneapolis-St Paul, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The vast majority of the victims were 15 years old or younger. A quarter of the victims were not Hmong.-- Proponents of the 1965 immigration bill swore up and down that it would not alter this country's demographic mix. As it turned out, Kennedy's immigration law has brought about the greatest demographic shift of any nation in world history.-- In 1980, Reagan won the biggest electoral landslide in history against an incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. Without the last 40 years of immigration, in 2012, Mitt Romney would have won a bigger landslide than Reagan did.

Jews are NOT White. Besides that who the heck cares if Romney won? He was just as bad as Obama. Here's a guy who wanted more troops in the Middle East, was claiming he was Mexican - granted his dad or granddad was born in Mexico but he was playing it up for the Mestizo invaders and I don't doubt that he was as pro-invader as Obama or Jeb Bush is. He man came up with Romney care that was only a blue print for Obamacare.   If you want real change and someone who supports Whites then vote for Merlin Miller or get Pat Buchanan to run. I was gonna let this one go, but...   I never implied that jews were White. Just the opposite. They are in the other category too. Might as well include them with the blacks. No, my point is they they are less than 2 percent of the US population, by their own admission. Granted, some jews control a lot of power via the entertainment industry, politics, and the investments section of our economy. But many do not, and would be easily kicked out of this country. Their hold on the US is tenuous at best. One good disaster or serious scandal of some sort and they're on the boat back to Europe or Israel.  And yea, Romney was no pick of the litter.

This has been the most dramatic historic ethnic change to any nation in world history. This is with lying to the American people—and without even consulting the American people on it, which is why I’m particularly enraged that every night I can see enthusiasm on MSNBC for ‘the browning of America, the browning of America, the browning of America.’ But if I say, ‘I don’t like what you’ve done,’ oh, that’s racist.”Ramos followed up by asking Coulter if he thinks America is a “stronger nation” because it’s “more diverse, more tolerant.”“It’s not more diverse, it’s more Mexican,” Coulter shot back.“I think it’s more diverse—much more diverse,” Ramos replied.After Ramos said he thinks “diversity” is “fantastic” and “beautiful,” Coulter wrapped the full segment with a question of her own for him.“We have taken in one quarter of the entire Mexican population,” Coulter asked him. “At what point will we have taken in enough, in your view?”“I think that with the legal system—“ he started to answer.“Half the Mexican population? The entire Mexican population?” Coulter kept pressing.“No, I think with the legal system we wouldn’t need and we wouldn’t be having hundreds of people dying crossing the border,” Ramos replied.“That isn’t an answer to the question,” Coulter corrected him. “One quarter of the Mexican population. How much more do we have to take?”Ramos dodged again, essentially admitting he supports no limit whatsoever.“It’s an economic situation,” he said. “As long as you have people here who need immigrants and workers and as long as you have workers needing a job, they’re going to be coming here. It’s an economic situation.”Ramos wrapped the interview at that point.Earlier in the interview, Coulter and Ramos sparred about the numbers of illegal aliens in America right now. After noting how he and Coulter were going to have an “honest debate,” Ramos started it off by saying to her: “your numbers are wrong.”“You are saying on page—right here, on page 72—that the real number of undocumented immigrants is 30 million,” Ramos said to Coulter.“I think you’re wrong, as I describe,” Coulter said. “The number we keep hearing is 11 million, 11 million, 11 million, 11 million—that’s so weird. It’s been 11 million for a decade.”After Ramos attempted but failed to cut her off—Coulter kept going and interrupted his interruption with “hey, I’m still explaining”—she explained why there are far more than 11 million illegal aliens in America.“As I explain in the book, they’re all using the Census figures,” Coulter said. “If the Census figures are wrong, then everybody’s numbers are wrong. I’m sorry, but it defies common sense that in the past decade that not one more illegal alien has come.“In fact, I cite the work, first of all, of two people advising people about their money, Bear Stearns analysts, and they looked at something other than the Census reports, which relies on people who have broken the law to be here telling the truth in government surveys. They said, no, instead we’re going to look at remissions of money back to Mexico, for example. That is money people send here. School enrollments in illegal alien hot spots. Housing permits in illegal alien hot spots.“Back in 2006, they said it was 20 million—two Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalists who spent a year investigating for Time Magazine, which you are one of the most influential people of—““So you better believe investigative reporters for Time Magazine and Vanity Fair,” Coulter continued. “In 2006, they said there have been another 3 million a year. That adds up to a minimum of 30 million.”“It says 11.3 [million] according to Pew Research Center,” Ramos said in response.“Yeah, they’re all relying on Census reports,” Coulter explained to Ramos.",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/26/jorge-ramos-admits-true-feelings-to-ann-coulter-no-limit-to-number-of-mexicans-allowed-into-america%E2%80%A8/,

Rush went on to say you can trace the demise of California to this.The Pew data Coulter referenced actually includes both native born and foreign born Hispanics of Mexican origin. Pew's summary of the data explained that this estimate includes 11.4 million immigrants born in Mexico and 22.3 million born in the U.S. who self-identified as Hispanics of Mexican origin.That means 65 percent of the people Coulter claimed that the United States has taken in, were born in this country.Using Coulter's flawed logic, if we were to analyze the number of people of Irish descent in the United States, the country has taken in 737 percent of the population of Ireland.",https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/28/ann-coulter-falsely-asserts-one-quarter-of-mexi/203804,

For each chapter, I selected a random endnote to check. I used a random number generator . Aftewards, I personally selected 5 more issues to check. I chose issues I thought were important like the number of illegal immigrants in the US.I scored each issue up to 100% based on, not politics. Coulter's average score across 10 checks was:. But that's just a quick overview. My main focus was on checking the details and explainingshe was right or wrong.Endnote quotes are, quotes from the main book are, and other quotes arein quotes was added by me for emphasis.It was easy to find page 10 of the pdf online:The 70% figure matches the report. This means the book text, which says majority, is correct.96% is the sum for either consumption only, or both consumption and savings. Coulter's wording is confusing. It sounds like she's saying 96% remit for both purposes, when actually 70% were remitting for consumption only. What she should have written, and presumably meant, is that 96% remit at least partially for consumption.Note that Coulter says In surveys. I appreciate that accuracy. She isn't saying this is actually true, it's just a survey result.I wouldn't take off points for Coulter just writing in her style which isn't always literal. But I think this is an actual wording error in an endnote, not a style choice to entertain readers. However, there's no serious error which would mislead a reader about what's happening in world affairs. It's just a technical wording error in an endnote. It doesn't meet my ideal standards, but it doesn't really hurt the book either.From Coulter's link 100,000 people is a minor exception? And the policy was to let them file from Mexico if they simply claimed to be legit? Dumb. But Coulter said the applications were mailed from Mexico, whereas this talks about applying at the border or a consulate.And what about the 100,000 farmworker[s] applying from New York City? Let's check the cited book . It discusses some ridiculous fraud similar in spirit to what Coulter wrote. But page 83 contradicts Coulter:That's not some 100,000. Page 89 is also relevant:The number is right. But this says filed, not mailed, so I think Coulter exaggerated on that point.The gist of what Coulter says in this part of the book is roughly accurate. There was a lot of fraud and the government did a bad job. But she wrote 100k and cited a book which says 29k. That's simply. However, it doesn't mislead the reader. If she simply changed the number, her passage would be OK. 29k and 100k are both big numbers, so the general idea is correctly communicated. I really don't like errors, but it's only a technical error, so I'm giving half credit. tweeted Coulter about this error, but received no response. I'd be happy to raise Coulter's score if she acknowledged the error and corrected it for the next edition.From the article So that's at least one murderer, and presumably more in the other 180,000 people who didn't get a background check. No doubt that's enough people withto include some robbers and rapists too.And to make matters worse, they weren't even trying to exclude robbers and thugs who commited their major crimes 5 years ago.This article, which complains several times about Republicans, is conceding everything. Since it's a hostile article – this is what Coulter's opponents are actually willing to admit to – I'm going to accept these numbers.180k is close enough to hundreds of thousands. It rounds up to 200k. The 70k and 10k figures are good. The murders, robbers and rapists claim is good.I appreciate endnotes which provide the link to the material.The Seattle Times is a perfectly reasonable source for quoting what someone said. Jayapal was indeed born in India Happily, Coulter actually links the article in a previous endnote.Time reports Mahmud's own wife told a Time reporter that Mahmud's a liar. There was no checking by the government, no need for documentation. Everything Coulter writes matches her source. Looks good to me.That concludes the random endnote checks. Now I'll choose 5 major issues to look at:Each endnote offers a link. 26 That last quote is from the New York Times, from 2006 not 2005. But close enough. It does reflect that the NYT thought there were similar to 11 million illegals in 2005.The report has some reasonable points:I don't think this is a perfect answer by any means. The Bear Stearns analysts don't have all the answers. But it's some reasonable information on the topic. Coulter herself emphasizes the topic doesn't have good enough data and statistics. For example:andThe big picture is we don't know all the numbers. Coulter's numbers make more sense than numbers she's challenging. That's good. And she doesn't overestate her case by claiming perfection with her stats.I'd say Coulter did a good job here. She presented the reader with useful information and put it in context in reasonable way. She challenged some claims that deserved challenging and gave some alternatives to consider that are more reasonable. They're imperfect, but the main point is people should stop accepting the 11 million figure and reconsider. Coulter's right about that.The Pew Research Center page linked does give the 33.5 million figure exactly as quoted. The population of mexico is around 120 million One problem is if we took in 33.5 million Mexicans, and there's 120 million in Mexico, then that's 153.5 million total, of which we have closer to a fifth (21.8%), not a quarter.I think Coulter's point was to put 33.5 million Mexicans in context. It's over a quarter of the current population of Mexico! That's a lot! I read her comment more as a stylistic choice than strictly about math. And I don't think rounding 21.8% to 25% is very bad, it's in the right ballpark.The one-quarter comment bothered Politifact , a group of partisan left-wingers who like to dress up their talking points as facts. Their best counter was:That sounds like a pretty big error. But let's see what the Pew analysis actually says:They were not looking for, or counting, anyone with any Mexican ancestry or roots like Politifact claims. They were only counting people whoas Hispanics of Mexican origin. Politifact is contradicting Pew's own statement about their data (hoping no one will notice) in order to try to make Coulter look bad.Did Coulter use loose language and exaggerate here? Yes. (Was what Politifact said worse? Yes!) But so what? You're allowed to talk loosely at times. The one quarter comment was putting things in perspective, not trying to be a rigorous analysis. There's plenty of other material inwhichmore rigorous and factual, and is worded to indicate that.I would like if Coulter was a little more careful at times, but I don't see any significant problem here. I don't think it would mislead a reader in general. There's a big problem and Coulter's saying there's a big problem, which is true.Another part of Politifact's article looked interesting to me. And I think picking issues to look at that her enemies bring up is a good method to try some. Coulter wrote:But Politifact says Well, they did indeed write that contradiction to Coulter. But they didn't argue it. At all. Coulter's position makes sense. This is just a center asserting something:And does endnote 50 have an argument that illegals respond to government surveys? No.That endnote is on the topic of estimating things about the people who did fill out surveys, not on the topic of how they established that illegals are filling out surveys in the first place.Rather than argue the issues, Politifact relied on judging statements by who said them It's not that the Center for Immigration Studies had a good argument. Or any argument at all. Nor does Politifact have an argument. Instead, it's that the Center for Immigration Studies is asserted by Poltifact to be anti-immigration, and their point is basically even the people who don't like immigration know Coulter is wrong. That's such an unscholarly approach that I wanted to point it out.For the issue of Politifact attacking Coulter's argument that illegals don't fill out governement surveys, I'd say Politifact did a lot worse than just remaining silent. It showed their own flaws, not any mistake by Coulter.That last claim Coulter made sounded interesting to me. Did the government really use a survey of illegals to try to find out whether (and at what rate) they answer surveys? Let's find out.The cited article says what Coulter claimed:But it's just a WSJ article with no cites or links. This is the internet! Why not link to the surveys you're talking about? :( He didn't even give the name of the study, the journal, or anyone involved with it, which makes it hard to search for.Even if I find the 2001 study and everything checks out, how would I know that the other unspecified studies presuming the 10% figuring were basing it largely on the 2001 study? To figure this out properly would require a bunch of work. Coulter or Bialik should have done this work, but they haven't. Coulter, unfortunately, seems to have just dumped responsibility on Bialik's article which makes some big claims without giving the details.I think Coulter's right about the issue here. For example the Bear Stearns Study says:andI didn't find a paper on the 2001 survey itself, but I found Immigrant Voting in Home Country Elections which has detailed information about it.Looks like the survey happened in the right place with the right number of people.This 38% non-response rate fits with the claim that almost two in five households refused to answer. (Note: they already are ignoring outcomes like no one was home. This is people who were there and didn't answer the questions, so the word refused is accurate.)That's a lot!Guess what the footnote is. Think it'll provide details of the 10% undercount? Or maybe it'll give their calculations for the 1.8-3.1 million range? No, all it does is say the government used the 10% number.That's not useful. Although it does provide an example of the 10% figure being used, like the WSJ article claimed.Here's another statement about the 10% undercount. It's in a paper that at least has a bunch of linked endnotes with citations written out:I looked for 2000 Census coverage of foreign-born Mexicans in Los Angeles County: Implications for demographic analysis by Marcelli and Ong. Google scholar is aware it exists. But it's not available online. It isn't just behind a paywall. There's no copy of it available. They presented it at an IRL meeting, and people cite it, but there's I see no mention of it actually being published anywhere. Here is the meeting information and the paper information And that's all the information we get. This makes it hardre to blame Bialik and Coulter for not providing more cites. These guys just publish a paragraph summary online and don't bother publishing their actual details. They share their ideas in person, apparently to be cited by other people who took notes while they were talking, I guess.Finally, I see the government is using this , as claimed:Note the 850,000 adjustment the INS used is 6.7%, not 10%, even though their footnote says 10%.OK now let's step back. Coulter said they asked people if they answered the census, and 10% said no. But I wasn't able to find that question from the survey and the results for it. Coulter's own citation should have led me to find that, since she makes that claim in her book. That's bad.On the other hand, she's right about the big picture: the government and others are pretty much just making stuff up instead of being scholars with facts. The quality of the work Coulter's questioning is ridiculously low. She's right to draw attention to it. The theme of her book holds up. So again I'm going to deduct some points for a technical problem (I couldn't find some of the specifics she brought up her endnotes, even after doing quite a bit of research), but Coulter hasn't said anything that would mislead a reader about the state of the world. She isn't playing loose with facts to trick anyone about anything.So, will illegal immigration destroy the country? Would amnesty mean Republicans never get elected again? Are these third-worlders assimilating, or not? Are we in danger? Is this a serious enough issue to really threaten our country? Could it be!?The article says:Like Coulter said. But where's the details? They were harder to find because Ruben Rumbaut's name is mispelled :( I did find some paywalled stuff, but since I don't even know which one they are talking about, I didn't buy it.Teixeira's article says, as claimed:(28% is a little low to be calling nearly a third.)What about assimilation?The article indeed is a bunch of appeasement of unassimilated immigrants. It has an attitude that their problems are white people's fault, and American needs to change to make Somalis better off. For example:The focus here is on Americans doing something, changing their thinking, looking at the world differently, etc, rather than on saying to the immigrants, Hey guys, you came here. If you want to make more money and be more educated, then you change. Start acting like Americans and you'll get the same results we do without our city changing anything.With immigrants not being assimilated and voting heavily for the Democrats, America is at genuine risk. But I wasn't satisfied with the details of the second generation immigrant cite. Again I'm not questioning the book's main themes, but I would have liked better research behind Coulter's factual details.Coulter's average score is 87.5%. But you should try to understand whatis like, not rely on a summary number. Please judge for yourself.Here's what I think:If you liked this, check out my previous Ann Coulter fact check , and my review of her critics' scholarship Thank you Justin Mallone for help finding some of the information.",http://curi.us/1820-adios-america-fact-check,

Says Obama called Sarah Palin a pig.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/10/john-mccain/if-theres-lipstick-on-a-pig-its-this-mccain-ad/,False,False,False,False,False,False,"We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better.","If there's lipstick on a pig, it's this McCain ad","The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned:“I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.”The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain’s proclaimed agenda for “change” in Washington.John McCain says he's about change, too, Obama said. And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'That's not change, Obama said. That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it’s still going to stink after eight years. We’ve had enough of the same old thing.Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!!Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama’s comments and Palin’s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize.“Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a ‘pig’ is not exactly what we want to see,” Swift said.The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain’s campaign tactics “lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.”On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called “Lipstick.” It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying “Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.” A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail.The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it’s clear that Obama isn’t talking about Sarah Palin. He’s talking about McCain’s argument that he represents change.Second, “putting lipstick on a pig” is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up.We weren’t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper The Hill labeled the phrase “Congress Speak” back in June, and gave it an official definition: “an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.”In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan’s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy’s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. “You know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,” she groused.Obama and McCain both have used the expression.In September 2007, Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy:“I think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,” Obama said. “George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.”In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton’s health care plan, calling it “eerily reminiscent” of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton’s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.“I think they put some lipstick on a pig,” McCain said, “but it’s still a pig.”On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush’s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. “It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don’t,” McCain said. “You can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it’s still a pig, in my view.”It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he’s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it’s hard to see how one could interpret Obama’s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama’s point, but his remark wasn’t the smear that McCain’s people have tried to make it.If anyone’s doing any smearing, it’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is Pants on Fire wrong.",http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/10/john-mccain/if-theres-lipstick-on-a-pig-its-this-mccain-ad/,

Barack Obama's reference to lipstick on a pig has Republicans demanding an apology and Democrats accusing Sen. John McCain of a pathetic attempt to play the gender card.McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's.Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in Norfolk, Virginia. Enough is enough. Watch Obama deliver his harsh words »The phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry. Read more about what Obama saidObama made his controversial lipstick remarks at a Virginia campaign stop late Tuesday afternoon. Watch what happens with politics and lipstick collide »John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,' he said.That's not change.

You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing. Watch how tensions are rising on the trail »The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line.The Illinois senator then praised both McCain's compelling story and Palin's interesting story, and said his hat goes off to anyone who's looking after five kids -- I've got two and they tire Michelle and me out. ...That's why John McCain's campaign manager [Rick Davis] said this campaign isn't going to be about issues, this campaign is going to be about personalities.Within minutes, the McCain campaign announced a conference call focused on the remark, which they said was a deliberate reference to Palin's line: You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her convention speech, and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail.In Iowa last October, McCain drew comparisons between Hillary Clinton's current health care plan and the one she championed in 1993: I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig. He used roughly the same line in May, after effectively claiming the Republican nomination.McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN the campaign saw a big difference between the two references: McCain was referring to a policy proposal. Obama was referring to [Alaska] Gov. Sarah Palin. It's obviously disrespectful and offensive. ...Who has been talking about lipstick lately? It was obvious. The crowd went crazy because of it.It wasn't the first time Obama used the line. In a phone interview with The Washington Post last September, he used it in reference to the situation in Iraq.I think that both Gen. [David] Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment, Obama told the Post. George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.Other politicians have also used the phrase in recent years, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rep. John Mica of Florida and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, among others.Torie Clarke, a former McCain adviser, even wrote a book called, Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game.Still, the McCain campaign says Obama's use was intentional, and they want an apology.Barack Obama's comments today are offensive and disgraceful. He owes Gov. Palin an apology, said Maria Comella, a McCain-Palin spokeswoman.Obama's campaign said enough is enough and accused McCain of running a dishonorable campaign.The McCain campaign's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy -- the same analogy that Sen. McCain himself used about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan just last year, said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn. This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run.McCain ally Mike Huckabee took Obama's side on the issue, saying he didn't think it was a swipe at Palin.It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin; he didn't reference her. If you take the two sound bites together, it may sound like it, he said on Fox's Hannity and Colmes.But I've been a guy at the podium many times, and you say something that's maybe a part of an old joke and then somebody ties it in. So, I'm going to have to cut him slack.But McCain's campaign is not about to let the issue go. They released a Web ad Wednesday that plays Obama's lipstick comments, then asks, Ready to lead? No. Ready to smear? Yes.CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand, Sasha Johnson and Chris Welch contributed to this report.",http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/campaign.lipstick/,

When asked why she was so certain that the comment was aimed at Mrs Palin - it is an expression so common it is the title of a book by a former Pentagon spokesman – she said it was an obvious reference to Mrs Palin's much-quoted line that the only difference between hockey moms and pitbull dogs was lipstick.It seemed to me a gendered comment. There's only one woman in the race, she said.Mrs Palin has electrified the Republican vote since her introduction into the race less than two weeks ago and has helped Mr McCain climb above his younger rival in the polls for the first time.Many in the audience in Lebanon laughed uproariously when Mr Obama made his lipstick remark, clearly taking it to be a reference to the first female Republican on a presidential ticket, who is highly unpopular with Democrats for her arch conservative views and personal attacks on their candidate.“I don’t think he meant it personally, but as soon as he said it I wondered if it would come back to haunt him,” said Tony Dodi, mayor of Lebanon and head teacher at the school where Mr Obama spoke last night.Robert Gibbs, chief Obama spokesman, ridiculed the notion that any offence was intended to Mrs Palin. “The expression is timeless and it has always meant that though you may dress something up, it doesn’t change what that something is.”",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/2774494/Sarah-Palin-was-target-of-Barack-Obamas-Lipstick-on-a-pig-jibe-says-McCain-camp.html,

Now, in the wake of Barack Obama's use of the saying and the McCain/Palin attacks against him over it, putting lipstick on a pig has become the latest flashpoint in the presidential campaign circus. But politicians and average joes have tossed around the folksy phrase long before this recent bump on the campaign trail. A sampling: One of the oldest published quotes using the entire phrase appeared in The Washington Post in November 1985. Asked by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to put his station's $20,000 fundraiser earnings toward the renovation of Candlestick Park, KNBR personality Ron Lyons scoffed, That would be like putting lipstick on a pig. While on the campaign trail with John Kerry in September 2004, then-vice presidential nominee John Edwards derided the Republicans' attempt to make lackluster job-creation numbers into a shining moment for the Bush administration. They're going to try every way they know to put lipstick on this pig, he said. But you know when you put lipstick on a pig, at the end of the day, it's still a pig. At a November 2004 Bush re-election campaign rally in Honolulu, Vice President Dick Cheney peppered his stump speech with the down-home expression, claiming John Kerry's tough talk about national security was nonsense. He's trying every which way to cover up his record of weakness on national defense. But he can't do it. It won't work, Cheney said. As we like to say in Wyoming, you can put all the lipstick you want on a pig, but at the end of the day it's still a pig. Torie Clarke, the Pentagon's communications chief during the early years of George W. Bush's presidency and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under Donald Rumsfeld, published in February 2006 Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game. Clarke, who also served at one time as McCain's press secretary, argues in the book that sugarcoating bad policy doesn't make the policy any better. A bad story is still a bad story. While campaigning in Iowa in October 2007, Senator John McCain used the popular expression to criticize Hillary Clinton's revamped health care plan, arguing that it wasn't much different from the one she unsuccessfully pushed in 1993. I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig, he said. McCain brought up the phrase again in May of this year to describe Clinton's health care plan at a town hall in Denver: I don't like to use this term, but the latest proposal I see is putting lipstick on a pig, he said. Speaking to more than 500 journalists at a Democratic campaign event in April, Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former presidential candidate John Edwards, said John McCain's healthcare proposals were like painting lipstick on a pig. It looked good on the surface, Edwards said, but underneath it was a mess. House Minority Leader John Boehner also used the homespun phrase in April, telling reporters that Republican fundraising efforts were far from where they needed to be to ensure victory in November. Right now our fundraising sucks, Boehner said. There's no other way to put it. There's no use putting lipstick on a pig.","http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1840392,00.html",

Lipstick” – which drew huge cheers from the GOP faithful.Former Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift, speaking on behalf of the McCain campaign, quickly called on Obama to apologize.“This is just the latest in a series of comments that females like me will find offensive . . . There’s only one woman in the race. It’s hard to think this was directed at anybody other than Gov. Palin.”Obama’s campaign spokesman insisted he wasn’t referring to Palin with the line, calling it an old expression.The Obama camp has struggled with how to handle Palin since GOP nominee John McCain made the surprising pick for his ticket. Palin gave the McCain campaign new energy, evidenced by a jump in the polls, a surge in volunteers, and big crowds.Recent polls show the race to be a dead heat or McCain with a slight lead, while the Republicans have gained among white women and independents since the Palin pick.But after Obama focused his attacks on McCain, in recent days he and running mate Joe Biden have been ratcheting up their direct hits on Palin.Obama has drawn laughs at his rallies by describing her as a “moose shooter,” even as he assures his audience he is complimenting her for her background and accomplishments.In Farmington Hills, Mich., a crowd booed on Monday when Obama first mentioned Palin’s name and laughed when he said she had a compelling biography.“Whatever,” an audience member shouted, as Obama tried to continue.And in Dayton, Ohio, today, another Obama crowd cheered “No pit bulls! No pit bulls!” – a reference to Palin’s joke.",http://nypost.com/2008/09/09/obama-put-lipstick-on-a-pig-its-still-a-pig/,

Barack Obama and John McCain, Vice President Dick Cheney and Rep. Charles Rangel. Joel Salatin, a farmer from Swoope, Va., talks about what actually happens when one attempts to put lipstick on a pig. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: Well, speaking of pork, we now have some thoughts on the phrase that sent the political world buzzing overnight. Yesterday, Barack Obama said this about John McCain. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Presidential Nominee): So I guess his whole angle is, watch out, George Bush. Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington. (Soundbite of applause) Sen. OBAMA: That's not change. SIEGEL: And then he invoked the wisdom of barnyard cosmetology. Sen. OBAMA: You know, you can put lipstick on a pig. (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. OBAMA: It's still a pig. SIEGEL: But the McCain campaign promptly accused Obama of sexism. They turned out at TV ads saying that Obama was referring to Sarah Palin, who has talked famously about lipstick herself. Governor SARAH PALIN (Republican, Alaska; Vice Presidential Nominee): You know, they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull, lipstick. (Soundbite of cheering) SIEGEL: But today, Obama expressed outrage. Sen. OBAMA: The McCain campaign would much rather have the story about phony and foolish diversions than about the future. SIEGEL: But the blogs, radio, TV, were already ablaze with this debate. A common expression, the Obama supporters said. And we wondered, how common? Well, Senator McCain said this about Hillary Clinton's health care plan this year. Senator JOHN McCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Presidential Nominee): I think they've put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: Dick Cheney aimed the phrase at John Kerry's campaign in 2004. Vice President DICK CHENEY (United States): You can put all the lipstick you want on a pig. But at the end of the day, it's still a pig. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: And then there was New York Democrat Charles Rangel speaking of a tax bill also in 2004. Representative CHARLES RANGEL (Democrat, New York): You can put lipstick on a pig, but you can't call it a lady. SIEGEL: And we have found instances of many other politicians - Democrats and Republicans - speaking the truth about pigs and lipstick. Now, the real test. Has anyone actually put lipstick on a pig? Well, joining us from Swoope, Virginia, where he's co-owner of Polyface Farms, is Joel Salatin. Welcome to the program, Mr. Salatin. Mr. JOEL SALATIN (Co-Owner, Polyface Farms): Thank you. It's - well, I'm not really with you. I'm out here in the field with the pigs. SIEGEL: I gather you have both a pig and some lipstick? Mr. SALATIN: Yes, sir.

SIEGEL: Does the pig look any better with the lipstick on him or her? Mr. SALATIN: No, they really don't. Now, you know, if you put a cummerbund around his loins and some Birkenstocks on his hooves, it might improve him a little bit. SIEGEL: Well, Joel Salatin, I just want us to agree here. I can't see what you've done, but I assume that no harm was done to any animal in the making of this story. Mr. SALATIN: No. In fact, they really didn't like it and they've all gone and started lying down. So I think I bored them. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: Perhaps they're smart animals.

The implication: Obama was slyly up to something when he said McCain's call for change in Washington is lipstick on a pig, days after Palin made a lipstick joke at the Republican convention.He's very eloquent, McCain told The Associated Press and Florida newspapers in an interview, and it was the wrong thing to say.A day earlier, hard-nosed Republican tactician Karl Rove, a former adviser to President Bush, said some of McCain's ads were not truthful and both sides should cool the attacks.McCain said of Obama's comment: I didn't like it. So we respond. I think the American people will judge as to whether he and others have treated Governor Palin fairly or not. But he said he won't let attacks go unanswered.McCain stood up for Palin at other times in the interview.He was asked about nearly $200 million in congressional pet projects Palin requested for 2009 for her state, despite her boasts that she opposes such projects and his claim that she didn't ask for any. McCain responded by criticizing Obama for seeking more than $900 million in these earmarks, by one count.That's nearly a million every day, every working day he's been in Congress, McCain said. And when you look at some of the planetariums and other foolishness that he asked for, he shouldn't be saying anything about Governor Palin.Did he call her a pig? McCain was asked. No, I but know that he chooses his words carefully, and it was the wrong thing to say, he responded.McCain cut off a question about the Bridge to Nowhere, which Palin claims to have killed in Alaska even though Washington pulled back money for the project before she turned against it.The important thing is she's vetoed a half a billion dollars in earmark projects — far, far in excess of her predecessor and she's given money back to the taxpayers and she's cut their taxes, so I'm happy with her record, McCain said.In addition to her current requests, state budget documents show Alaska requested 52 earmarks worth $256 million for 2008.",http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26724457/,

He deployed it last year to describe the Bush administration's Iraq war strategy. ,Obama refuses to apologise for 'pig in lipstick' jibe as women switch to the Republicans in droves,"Barack Obama was at the centre of a sexist smear storm last night after he was accused of comparing Republican vice-presidential hopeful Sarah Palin to a pig in lipstick. The Democrat nominee angrily refused to apologise after he told a cheering crowd of supporters: 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.' John McCain's supporters immediately claimed he was making a direct reference to Mrs Palin because she had joked at the Republican convention last week that 'lipstick' was the only difference between a 'hockey mom' like her and a pitbull.The row couldn't come at a worst time for the Obama camp as polls show women switching in droves to the Republicans, attracted by Sarah Palin's dramatic and historic introduction to the White House fray.The McCain campaign called Mr Obama's remarks 'sexist, offensive and disgusting' and demanded an apology. - despite the fact that John McCain had used the same phrase in 2007 in reference to Hillary Clinton's healthcare policies.They quickly put out an 'attack ad' claiming the lipstick jibe was clearly aimed at Mrs Palin and saying of Mr Obama: 'Ready to lead? No. Ready to smear? Yes.'The advert included a recent clip of a TV news presenter observing that one lesson of the campaign was the 'continued and accepted role of sexism in American life'.But the Illinois senator, angered at being pilloried for comments he believed were taken out of context, hit back at Republicans for stirring a 'made-up controversy'.'Enough is enough,' he said. 'What their campaign has done is the same game that has made people sick and tired of politics in this country,' he said.'They seize on an innocent remark, try to take it out of context, throw up an outrageous ad because they know that it's catnip for the news media. 'I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phoney outrage.'Lies and outrage: Barack Obama speaks to supporters in Norfolk, VirginiaDemocrat aides insisted Mr Obama was not taking a swipe at the 44-year-old Alaska governor, pointing out the 'lipstick on a pig' expression is common phrase used in U.S. politics to describe old policies dressed up to look new.Mrs Palin, a mother of five, has energised the McCain campaign since being named as his running mate, spearheading a leap in the polls, a surge in volunteers and big crowds wherever she goes.Despite Mr Obama's insistence last night that he meant no offence, Democrat strategists feared it could fuel the backlash over perceptions that he treated Hillary Clinton poorly during their heated primary campaign.'Lipstick has been the buzzword of the campaign coverage ever since Palin mentioned it in her speech so to use the words pig and lipstick in the same sentence was incredibly na've,' said one party strategist. 'Whatever Obama really meant, an awful lot of voters are going to think that he was saying that Palin is a pig.'Mr Obama, 47, drew the farmyard analogy while criticising Mr McCain's attempts to hijack his campaign theme of bringing change to Washington.Popular: Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin signs autographs as she enters a campaign rally in Lebanon, OhioSpeaking to a rally in Virginia, he said: 'John McCain says he's about change, too, and so I guess his wholeangle is, Watch out George Bush. Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy. That's not change. That's just calling something the same thing, something different.'But you know,' he added, 'you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know, you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years.' The McCain campaign was quick to capitalise on the pig blunder. Jane Swift, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, said: 'As far as I know there is only one candidate in this contest who wears lipstick. It's clear to me that Senator Obama owes Governor Palin an apology.'Both campaigns then went into overdrive to find past examples of their opponents using the phrase.The Obama campaign swiftly circulated a 2007 article quoting Mr McCain using the term 'lipstick on a pig' in reference to a healthcare proposal from Mrs Clinton.It was not the first time Mr Obama has used the phrase. He deployed it last year to describe the Bush administration's Iraq war strategy.McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers hit back at Mr Obama last night saying: 'Barack Obama can't campaign with schoolyard insults and then try to claim outrage at the tone of the campaign. His talk of new politics is as empty as his campaign trail promises.'See video of Mr Obama's speech here",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1054135/Obama-refuses-apologise-pig-lipstick-jibe-women-switch-Republicans-droves.html,

Barack Obama angrily challenged Republican claims that he insulted Gov. Sarah Palin by using the expression ""lipstick on a pig"" to describe Sen. John McCain's attempts to paint himself as an agent of change, and called the GOP indignation ""phony outrage and Swift boat politics."" ""What their campaign has done this morning is the same game that makes people sick and tired about politics in this country,"" Obama told students at Granby High School in Norfolk, Va. Obama was referring to a new Web video that states that Obama called Palin a pig, as well as demands by the GOP's Palin Truth Squad that he apologize to Palin for the remark, insisting it was a direct shot at the Republican vice presidential candidate. ""She is the only one of the four candidates for president, or the only vice presidential candidate who wears lipstick,"" said former Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift, a member of the Palin Truth Squad. ""I mean, it seemed to me a very gendered comment."" ObamaPlay null Watch Gov. Sarah Palin's Exclusive Interview With ABC News' Charlie Gibson Beginning Thursday Palin had highlighted her use of lipstick during her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention by calling herself a ""hockey mom"" and joking that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull was lipstick. Obama did not sound like he intended to apologize during his campaign stop this morning in Virginia. ""Spare me the phony outrage, spare me the phony talk about change,"" Obama scoffed. ""The McCain camp would much rather have this be about phony and foolish diversions,"" Obama said. He said it was reminiscent of earlier Republican campaign tactics of ""lies, phony outrage and Swift Boat politics."" The Swift Boat politics was a reference to a GOP campaign to raise questions four years ago about Sen. John Kerry's service in Vietnam, despite the fact that Kerry won three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star. ""Enough,"" Obama said and began a speech about the economy. Nevertheless, the Republicans made clear they are not giving up on the issue. ""Obama stepped in it,"" a McCain aide told ABC News and the campaign believes it will resonate with women voters. The uproar began when Obama ridiculed the argument by the GOP ticket of McCain and Palin that they would be the team to change the politics of Washington, taking over a theme that had been Obama's campaign mantra. GOP Angry Over Obama Comment ""'We're really gonna shake things up in Washington,'"" Obama said, mocking McCain's claim to offer change. ""That's not change. That's just calling something the same thing, something different. But you know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. ""You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing! It's time to bring about real change to Washington. And that's the choice you've got in this election,"" Obama said. Told of the whole quote, Swift suggested that Obama was also calling his opponents ""an old rotten fish."" Democrats tried to dismiss the Republican accusation. ""Enough is enough. The McCain campaign's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn. ""This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run,"" Dunn said. ""That expression is older than my grandfather's grandfather,"" said Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""And it means that you can dress something up but it doesn't change what it is. He was talking pretty clearly about the fact that you can't just call yourself change when you've voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time."" 'Lipstick' Jungle: McCain, Obama Presidential Contest Gets Ugly The Obama campaign also pointed out that McCain used the same words -- ""lipstick on a pig"" -- last October to describe Sen. Hillary Clinton's health care plan. Obama is finding, however, that the presidential race is no longer a two-man -- or a two-person -- race, and Palin's entrance has changed the dynamic. Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, said Palin and the Republicans are eager to make the race personal. ""Folks, look, I know what she's going to try to do. She's going to try to make it as personal as she can,"" he said. Palin, Biden noted, has ""a ""compelling initial story"" and personality, and it's a big deal to have a woman nominated to be vice president, but eventually, the momentum will return to the Democrats' side. ""I think you're going to see this thing change,"" he said, predicting that the change will come as Palin makes her positions known on issues such as Supreme Court justices and global warming. Obama said he didn't believe polls that showed Palin's emergence as the GOP's VP candidate had vaulted McCain and Palin into a tie or a lead with the Democrats. ""The notion that people are swinging back and forth in the span of a few weeks, or a few days, this wildly generally isn't borne out,"" Obama said Tuesday. ABC News' political analyst Matthew Dowd agreed that the GOP surge may not last. ""Usually when you have swings this large and this quick, they don't stick for a long time,"" Dowd told ""Good Morning America."" Dowd said that Palin is the ""buzz"" of the campaign at the moment. ""It's hard to talk about anything else other than her personality. She is the pivot in this race, which everybody is trying to figure out how to deal with."" Referring to the lipstick remark, Dowd said it was ""an expression that was fine to use two weeks ago. ... My guess is whether they apologize or not, Barack Obama will never use that expression again in the next 60 days."" Sarah Palin Effect: Will It Last for John McCain? It remains to be seen whether Sarah Palin's popularity will hold up during the nearly two months of campaigning before the November election. So far, she hasn't strayed far from the convention speech that introduced her to voters and, not including a homecoming rally when she returns to Alaska this week, has not campaigned without McCain. Alaska is, of course, safe territory for Palin to make her solo debut. Her approval rating in her home state is sky high and the crowd will be huge. Palin will also submit to her first grilling by the national press when she sits down later this week with ABC News' Charlie Gibson. She will also face off with Biden in the first and only vice presidential debate next month.",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=5769091&page=1,

""You can put lipstick on a pig all day long, but it's still a pig.",Barack Obama is just the latest politician to use the expression 'lipstick on a pig' - John McCain has as well,"Over the years, American politicians of all political stripes have applied a lot of lipstick to a lot of pigs, rhetorically speaking.It is not just Barack Obama, who this morning struck back at what he called the latest made-up controversy - Republican accusations that he insulted Alaska governor Sarah Palin by using a common folk expression to describe John McCain's policies.The Democratic presidential candidate yesterday said, You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. He was speaking of the McCain campaign's effort to rebrand itself as a change campaign, rather than one founded on the former prisoner of war's experience in Vietnam and his 26 years in the US House of Representatives and Senate. Obama continued, You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink.The McCain campaign, which since last week has been quick to accuse the news media and the Democrats of sexism in their criticism of vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, cried outrage.Hoping to stoke anger among female voters, McCain aides dispatched former Massachusetts governor Jane Swift on a conference call with reporters to accuse the Illinois senator of insulting Palin, who, Swift pointed out, is the only of the four candidates in the race who wears lipstick. This morning, the McCain campaign released to the media an advertisement saying Obama had smeared Palin.Campaigning in Virginia today, Obama said the McCain campaign is using the lipstick matter to distract Americans from Republican failures on the economy and other fronts, and keep the news media focused on trivialities.What their campaign has done this morning is what has made folks sick and tired of politics in this country, Obama said at a campaign event. He said the Republicans had taken an innocent remark about McCain's economic plan out of context.Suddenly they say, 'Oh, you must be talking about the governor of Alaska. The McCain campaign would rather have a story about phoney and foolish diversions than about the future. We've got an energy crisis, we have an education system that is not working for too many of our children ... We've got two wars going on, veterans coming home, not being cared for, and this is what they want to talk about. This is what they want to spend two out of the last 55 days talking about.Observers from both sides of the political aisle have noted the expression is an old folk saying. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who is known to sling a folkism now and then, said last night, It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin. He didn't reference her.McCain himself used it last autumn, comparing Hillary Clinton's healthcare proposal to that which she developed while first lady.Other politicians have used the phrase to denigrate everything from an abortion rights bill to efforts to reform the US healthcare system.Here are some other instances of the colourful American idiom:Senator Tom Harkin, speaking in 1991 about president George Bush Sr's plan to send military aid to the El Salvador army, said, To suggest they are guardians of liberty because they have committed fewer human rights violations in the latter half of 1990 is like putting lipstick on a pig - you've dressed it up a bit but you haven't changed the nature of the beast.Former Democratic Texas governor Ann Richards, speaking of the same President Bush's 1992 call for the Democratic Congress to move on a constitutional amendment to force the government to keep a balanced budget, said, You can put lipstick on a pig and call it Monique, but it's still a pig.Anti-abortion lobbyist Doug Johnson in 1992 used the phrase to describe efforts to attach minor restrictions on abortions to a bill that would explicitly affirm abortion rights. He said the amendments would make the bill, which he opposed, more palatable and facilitate its passage. You don't want to put lipstick on a pig, Johnson said.For Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, one of the most conservative members of the Senate until his defeat in 2006, legislative reforms to government subsidies for southern peanut and sugar farmers were the lipstick. The pig was the subsidy programme itself.In 1998, Republican Ohio congressman John Boehner used the phrase to describe what he said was a rudderless Republican congress that had suffered losses in that year's election.When there's no agenda and there's no real direction, what happens is you can't - you really can't have a message, he said.

The ad has since been pulled, because the campaign also used footage of CBS anchor Katie Couric without securing the proper permission first (an ongoing problem with the McCain campaign – or, perhaps more evidence of McCain's emulation of Bush, showing up in his contempt for the law).Viewed in the context of the stump speech from which the lipstick on a pig line was pulled, it's clear that Obama was not directly calling Palin a pig:The pig in question is John McCain's policies, not Sarah Palin.But was it still sexist?Obama's had what we'll call a bit of a problem using sexist dog whistles and soubriquets, and his campaign has not been above using overt sexism and engaging in double standards when it's suited him. And it's no secret that I think he's got to improve the way he speaks (at minimum) about women's issues, from reproductive rights to AIDS prevention.It's a misconception that I'm hard on Obama for this stuff because I don't like him; the truth is that I want him to beat John McCain – no, not just beat him: I want him to trounce John McCain by double digits and ensure that the man never comes within 100 yards of the White House unless on a tourist excursion during his long overdue retirement. (Not because he's old, but because he sucks.) I'm hard on Obama because I don't want him to win on the back of misogyny and because I want him to be solid on women's issues, which will help him win.But the point is, I'm hard on him. And calling his lipstick on a pig line sexist?It might have been a dog whistle – except for the fact that dog whistles have to make some sort of sense. In the context of Obama talking about McCain's policies, and how are in perfect alignment with Bush's policies, suddenly implying Sarah Palin's a pig is utterly nonsensical. It's a non sequitur. However, implying that McCain's dressing up the same old shit as change is like putting lipstick on a pig, well, that makes sense.If Obama had been talking about Palin being added to the ticket, and how, even though she's a woman, she embraces the same anti-feminist policies as every other bloody Republican, and that's no more real change than putting lipstick on a pig is, that would be a dog whistle. Context matters – and if that's the context we were talking about, I would be writing something very different indeed.But that's not what happened.It was nonetheless exceptionally tone-deaf; Palin had, merely a week earlier, taken to the national stage and firmly associated herself with the image of a pitbull in lipstick. Inevitably, the lipstick on a pig line was going to invoke that widely-discussed bit of Palin's address, and Obama should have known to lay off of it. There's no reason to hand the most mendacious people in the world stuff to use against you.And use it against him they did – positioning themselves as some sort of feminist crusaders, even as they simultaneously cast their own veep candidate as a helpless damsel being stalked by wild animals.It's breathtakingly audacious, and just as infuriating.Because here's the thing about the GOP erroneously playing the gender card by co-opting feminist rhetoric and twisting it into some funhouse mirror version of feminism to be wielded as a weapon against the Democrats: It contributes to a cultural environment in which legitimate complaints about sexist rhetoric are already not taken as seriously as they should be, where they are routinely dismissed with charges of hypersensitivity and hysteria. That the GOP will further discredit feminism in the process of destroying Obama is not a flaw of this strategy, but a feature.That's bigger than Obama – and that's why I'm hard on him.He can't give them anything.Not an inch. Not a word.And they don't care a whit about sexism, except insofar as it can be used to their advantage – like being levied as a charge against an opponent. Even when he isn't being sexist.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/uselections2008.sarahpalin,

You heard me right. While blasting the GOP ticket at a campaign event, Obama said, You know, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. The crowd went wild, clearly believing Obama was referencing Palin's convention line, What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick. When is he going to stop?Team Obama claims this is just an old expression. I'd be more willing to believe that if Obama didn't have a history of making these kinds of flubs. Aside from the lipstick pig comments, here are some of Obama's other greatest sexist hits—these were used against Hillary: You challenge the status quo and suddenly the claws come out . You know, over the last several weeks since she fell behind, she's resorted to what's called 'kitchen sink' strategies. . . . She's got the kitchen sink flying, and the china flying, and the, you know, the buffet is coming at me .And let's not forget Obama calling a female reporter Sweetie , while ducking her question.On top of Lipstickgate, Obama's VP Joe Biden stepped in it with women yesterday, too. As Palin is steadily locking in women voters for her ticket, Biden crassly told a reporter , I assume she thinks and agrees with the same policies that George Bush and John McCain think, and that's obviously a backward step for women. He didn't say she's backward on any particular issue, only that he assumes her thoughts are a carbon-copy of President Bush and John McCain's and well, they're just backward, too. I guess a pretty little woman like her just takes her orders from the big boys. Ha.If Obama and Biden haven't learned by know what is appropriate and inappropriate to say about women, they aren't going to. If you watched the GOP convention, you would have see that Republican men were much more willing to fight back against sexism than they've gotten credit for. Did you see Rudy Giuliani defend Palin from the media's dirty attacks? He could have dang near been a member of NOW with that feminist critique! But where were the liberal, male Democrats when Hillary needed defending? (Her husband doesn't count.) Nowhere. Outta sight. That should tell you something.Where is the Democratic feminist outrage on this? Where are the women's rights groups like NOW and the Feminist Majority Foundation?

Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki countered the accusation, saying, That expression is older than my grandfather's grandfather and it means that you can dress something up but it doesn't change what it is. Is the expression really that old?The concept is an old one, but the phrasing used by Obama is rather new. Many porcine proverbs describe vain attempts at converting something from ugly to pretty, or from useless to useful. The famous maxim that You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear dates back at least to the mid-16th century. Other old sayings play on the ludicrousness of a pig getting dressed up. A hog in armour is still but a hog was recorded in 1732 by British physician Thomas Fuller. As Francis Grose later explained in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1796), a hog in armour alludes to an awkward or mean looking man or woman, finely dressed. Charles H. Spurgeon noted another variation in his 1887 compendium of proverbs, The Salt-Cellars: A hog in a silk waistcoat is still a hog, meaning, Circumstances do not alter a man's nature, nor even his manners.The lipstick variation is relatively novel—not surprising, since the word lipstick itself dates only to 1880. The incongruity of pigs and cosmetics was expressed as early as 1926 by the colorful editor Charles F. Lummis, writing in the Los Angeles Times: Most of us know as much of history as a pig does of lipsticks. But the exact wording of putting lipstick on a pig (or hog) doesn't show up until much later. In 1985, the Washington Post quoted a San Francisco radio host on plans for renovating Candlestick Park (instead of building a new downtown stadium for the Giants): That would be like putting lipstick on a pig.Ann Richards did much to boost the saying's political popularity when she used a number of variations while governor of Texas in the early '90s. In 1991, in her first budget-writing session, she said, This is not another one of those deals where you put lipstick on a hog and call it a princess. The next year, at a Democratic barbecue in South Dakota, she criticized the George H.W. Bush administration for using warships to protect oil tankers in the Middle East, which she considered a hidden subsidy for foreign oil. You can put lipstick on a hog and call it Monique, but it is still a pig, she said. Richards returned to the theme in her failed 1994 gubernatorial race against the younger Bush, using the call it Monique line to disparage her opponent's negative ads.Since then, lipstick on a pig has spiced up the political verbiage of everyone from Charlie Rangel to Dick Cheney. John McCain himself used it last year to describe Hillary Clinton's health care proposal. And even though the folksy expression is one that sounds old (and connects back to genuinely old proverbs), it's not quite the vintage of anyone's grandfather's grandfather.",http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/09/who_first_put_lipstick_on_a_pig.html,

It’s the unofficial ones that aren’t.",Trump's 'Made in America' week: the president's hypocrisy is on display,"Donald Trump has declared this week “Made in America” week. According to the White House, it’s an opportunity for the president to showcase “products that are made in America”.Unfortunately for Trump, that description would rule out many of the products he and members of his family have made and sold. From Donald J Trump Collection clothing to Trump Vodka to Trump: the Game, the president has a track record of not making things in America.The week was scheduled to kick off at the White House on Monday, with Trump walking around some tables looking at products made in all 50 states. So in honour of the president’s communist-dictator-esque photo opportunity, here’s a look at some not-made-in-America Trump gear.Trump Vodka (“The finish is disappointingly harsh” – InternetWines.com) was an ill-fated attempt by Trump to branch into the spirits world. The vodka (“No discernable flavor” – Chicagoist) was manufactured in the Netherlands by a company called Wanders Distillery and launched in the US in 2006.But the beverage (“My taste buds unfortunately associate the flavor with the smell of paint” – VodkaBuzz) failed to sell. The trademark was abandoned in 2008, according to Rolling Stone. By 2011, Trump Vodka was “out of circulation”.“We don’t need Chinese products,” Trump told Fox News in 2010. “The stuff that’s been sent over from China is – it falls apart after a year and a half. It’s crap.”It was an odd thing to say for a self-described master businessman offering to the American public many menswear products – featured in the Donald J Trump Signature Collection – that were made in China.Donald J Trump eyeglasses were made in China. Donald Trump’s ties were made in China. Some of the Donald J Trump suits were made in China.To be fair, Trump is an equal opportunity overseas manufacturer. His dress shirts have been manufactured in Bangladesh, Honduras and Vietnam. And China.It turned out Trump was right about people not needing Chinese products. In 2015, the Donald J Trump Signature Collection was jettisoned by Macy’s. His famous red hats, meanwhile, actually are made in the US. It’s the unofficial ones that aren’t.Trump University (“A fraud from beginning to end” – New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman) was a US business.But the university, which was not actually an accredited university, encouraged students to outsource jobs overseas.“We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs – how sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses,” Trump wrote on the Trump University blog in 2005. “But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.”In November 2016, Trump settled three fraud lawsuits relating to the university for $25m.“Several Trump Home items are listed as made in China or imported from China,” the Washington Post reported in 2016.According to the Post, foreign-made items in Trump’s furniture collection include mirrors, ceramic vases, wall decorations, kitchen items and lighting fixtures. They were all made in China. Some Trump Home picture frames were manufactured in India.Earlier this year, Peter York, who wrote a 2006 book about the homes of autocrats, including Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceaușescu, wrote about the similarities between their tastes and Trump’s interior decor preferences.“The best aesthetic descriptor of Trump’s look, I’d argue, is dictator style,” York said.Trump: the Game (“I loathed every miserable second of it” – Ars Technica) was launched in 1989, then pushed out again in 2004 after Trump became host of The Apprentice.The game (“Bizarre” – Business Insider) was manufactured in the US by Milton Bradley Company. But the dice, according to this photo of the Trump: the Game packaging, were made in China.It is difficult to tell if the dice were “crap” and fell apart after a year and a half, because Trump: the Game sold poorly. In 2011, Time magazine listed the game as one of Trump’s top 10 business failures.It’s not just Donald Trump who has a track record of overseas manufacturing. In December, the New York Times, citing two trade databases, reported that “almost all” of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line is made overseas.In May, New York-based activists were arrested in China while investigating the making of Ivanka Trump shoes. In July, the Washington Post traced Ivanka Trump products to Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.More than 20 stores have dropped Ivanka Trump’s products since her father started his run for president.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/17/made-in-america-week-donald-trump-businesses,

There's a good chance that both will be wearing a Donald Trump Make America Great Again hat. The ugly, weird red hat has become a sensation during this campaign season. Even Tom Brady has gotten in on the action. Well this week, the LA Times has a fascinating look at the people who make these hats. And it turns out many of them are the same people who Donald Trump wants to keep out of the country with a wall.But look around the factory floor where these hats are being made by the thousands, and you’ll find faces that don’t seem to fit into Trump’s America. Yolanda Melendrez is one of them. Melendrez, an immigrant from Mexico who was brought to the United States by her parents when she was a baby, has worked at the Carson-based Cali-Fame headwear company since 1991. 'When we first got the order [for the Trump hats], I said to myself, ‘Just wait until he sees who’s making his hats. We’re Latinos, we’re Mexicans, Salvadoreños.’Trump has not just spoken of wanting a wall to keep Mexicans from coming to the U.S., but he's also gone so far as to disparage the Mexican people as a whole. So far during this campaign he has said of Mexican immigrants:When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.And if that wasn't crazy enough, he decided it was best to make his claims about immigrants even more ludicrous and confusing:People came into the country illegally and killed their children, Trump said. The illegals come in and the illegals kill their children.It's kind of crazy. All Donald Trump has to do to learn that he's wrong about immigrants is look to where his own hats are being made. Because, at the Cali-Fame factory in southern California, a bunch of men and women who were not born in this country are working their asses off to make the most popular campaign item of the season. And they're doing it to pay their bills so their families can eat. Isn't that weird?

Not necessarily always the case, an Associated Press review found.The iconic, baseball-style hats are indeed stitched together at a small factory in the Los Angeles area. But at least one of the hats in a small sample tested by AP and an outside expert did not contain the specific type of American-made fabric the hats' manufacturer insists his factory always uses to make each one.The true origin of the fabric in that hat remains a mystery — whether U.S.- or foreign-made and by whom — and a striking example of how difficult and murky it can be to verify something is actually Made in USA. The Republican presidential candidate has made it a cornerstone of his campaign that U.S. companies and individuals should aim for that standard to bring back American jobs, even if it means paying more.Informed of the AP's findings, Trump said any misrepresentation would be unacceptable. I pay a good price for that hat. If it's not made in the USA, we'll bring a lawsuit.The AP review included a microscopic analysis of five hats bought from Trump's campaign website, which showed the fabric in one was of a different type than that made by the supplier the manufacturer told the AP provides all his hat fabric.In addition to the fabric analysis, two of the manufacturer's employees, including a top sales agent, said the hats' fabric, bills and stiffeners were imported.The factory's owner, Brian Kennedy of Cali-Fame of Los Angeles Inc., said the two employees were wrong, but he refused to explain the fabric discrepancy. Federal law requires that items labeled Made in USA be made from materials all or virtually all from the United States.I'm not using imported materials, Kennedy told the AP. We're playing by the rules.On a broad level, the tale of Trump's hats shows the challenge of revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, which has been ravaged by cheap competition from overseas. Trump has accused Asian countries of unfairly manipulating their currencies to boost exports.Labor costs in Asia are so low that hats or other clothing can cost less than half the price of products made in the United States. Asian fabric prices are also lower, though less dramatically. While Trump has tried to get Made in USA hats for his campaign, knockoffs of those hats, clearly made in China, do a brisk business for other vendors. And Trump's private companies and the clothing line run by his daughter, Ivanka, routinely sell clothes and other products made in China and other Asian countries.Trump has warned Ford Motor Co. that he would place a 35 percent tax on cars sent to the U.S. from a planned plant in Mexico, and he has pledged to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country.All it takes is a commitment to winning and making 'Made in America' a badge of honor like it used to be, Trump wrote last year.But the Trump campaign's experience shows how difficult it can be to be utterly certain of a product's provenance. Trump told the AP that his staff had visited Cali-Fame's factory and reviewed paperwork guaranteeing the hats qualified for Made in the USA labeling. It was very important to us that these hats be made in the USA, he said.Kennedy, the factory owner, provided the AP with a copy of a certificate dated March 24, 2016. It shows the purchase of 1,488 yards of U.S.-origin, red polyester-cotton blended fabric, called Saxtwill, from Carr Textile Corp. of Fenton, Missouri. Kennedy later provided copies of three other certificates from Carr Textile, dated September 2015, for components of black and white hats of U.S. origin.Kennedy declined to comment further after the AP told him that a microscopic analysis of the fabric in a red cap the AP purchased directly from Trump's campaign website did not match the red Saxtwill material that the AP obtained directly from Carr Textile. He said providing any further detail would reveal proprietary information.To do the microscopic analysis, the AP obtained samples directly from Carr of the same red polyester-cotton blended fabric that Kennedy said was in the hats: one type imported and one U.S.-made. The AP asked Deborah Young, a professor of textiles and clothing at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, to compare two Trump hats that the AP had purchased from the campaign website with the fabric samples. The AP did not identify the fabric samples to prevent bias.Her conclusion: The material in one Trump hat was inconsistent with either Carr sample.

There's no way this hat was made out of either (Carr) sample.The analysis was not able to determine where the fabric in that hat actually came from.Young said the other Make America Great Again hat that the AP had also purchased from Trump's campaign could have come from either the U.S.-made Carr fabric, from Carr's cheaper imported fabric, or from an entirely different source.After receiving Young's opinion, the AP bought an additional three hats from the Trump campaign for review. Those were also compatible with either Carr's Saxtwill or the cheaper fabric that Carr imports.In addition to the fabric analysis, two of Cali-Fame's employees, Andy Meade and Angela Olague, told the AP and a product distributor, separately, that the hats were made from imported fabric and other components.The AP asked Kevin O'Brien, the president of Ethix Ventures Inc. of Boston, a distributor specializing in U.S.-produced, sweatshop-free merchandise, to call Meade, Cali-Fame's top sales agent, on the AP's behalf to ask about the company' hat prices and the origin of the hats' materials. The AP asked O'Brien to call so that the company's employees would respond as they would to a regular industry customer.It's domestic made of imported, Meade said.An AP reporter separately called Olague in the company's sales department to ask which materials were imported, disclosing that he worked for The Associated Press when asked.The hats are made in the USA, but all the materials are not, Olague told the AP of the company's Made in America product line. Pressed further, she said the factory could hypothetically produce hats from American-made fabric — but only if the customer supplied domestic fabric with the same specifications of the material Cali-Fame used.Meade and Olague declined subsequently to speak to the AP.

But in a small sample tested by The Associated Press and an outside expert, at least one did not contain the specific type of U.S.-made fabric the manufacturer insists is always used for the hats.The true origin of the fabric in that hat remains a mystery — whether U.S. or foreign made. It shows how difficult and murky it can be to verify something is actually Made in USA.Informed of AP's findings, Trump said any misrepresentation would be unacceptable. He said: I pay a good price for that hat. If it's not made in the USA, we'll bring a lawsuit.The Republican presidential candidate has made it a cornerstone of his campaign that U.S. companies and individuals should aim for the Made in America standard to bring back American jobs, even if it costs more.The AP review included a microscopic analysis of five hats bought from Trump's campaign website. The analysis showed the fabric in one hat was of a different type than that made by the supplier the manufacturer told the AP provides all his hat fabric.In addition to the fabric analysis, two of the manufacturer's employees, including a top sales agent, said the hats' fabric, bills and stiffeners were imported.The factory's owner, Brian Kennedy of Cali-Fame of Los Angeles Inc., said the two employees were wrong, but he declined to explain the fabric discrepancy. Federal law requires that items labeled Made in USA be made from materials all or virtually all from the United States.I'm not using imported materials, Kennedy told the AP. We're playing by the rules.On a broad level, the tale of Trump's hats shows the challenge of revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, which has been ravaged by cheap competition from overseas. Trump has accused Asian countries of unfairly manipulating their currencies to boost exports.Labor costs in Asia are so low that hats or clothing can cost less than half the price of products made in the United States. Asian fabric prices are also lower, though less dramatically. While Trump has tried to get Made in USA hats for his campaign, knockoffs, clearly made in China, do a brisk business for other vendors. And Trump's private companies and the clothing line run by his daughter Ivanka routinely sell clothes and other products made in China and other Asian countries.Trump has warned Ford Motor Co. that he would place a 35 percent tax on cars sent to the U.S. from a planned plant in Mexico, and he has pledged to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country.All it takes is a commitment to winning and making 'Made in America' a badge of honor like it used to be, Trump wrote last year.But the Trump campaign's experience shows how difficult it can be to be utterly certain of a product's provenance. Trump told the AP that his staff had visited Cali-Fame's factory and reviewed paperwork guaranteeing the hats qualified for Made in the USA labeling. It was very important to us that these hats be made in the USA, he said.The requirements for labeling a product as made in the USA go well beyond stipulating that it be produced in a factory on American soil.

We're Latinos, we’re Mexicans, Salvadoreños,' said Yolanda Melendrez, the 44-year-old employee who runs the floor, starting at the Southern California factor in 1991 as a machine operator before climbing the ladder.Trump, right out of the presidential campaign gate, took a hard stance on illegal immigration.So tough that he suggested illegal Mexicans living in the United States were rapists.He's said again and again that he would make Mexico pay to build a wall between the two countries.And he's often said these things with a grin wearing that hat.It's a 'five-panel trucker hat with cord,' explained Brian Kennedy, the president of Cali-Fame.The Southern California company started a business relationship with Trump a decade ago, producing hats – clearly made in America – for the businessman's branded golf courses.When candidate Trump reached out to the company to produce the political merchandise, Kennedy told the Los Angeles Times he felt the need to address his workers.'I said to them, We're not political. We're here to work,' Kennedy said.Kennedy also told the Los Angeles Times that 100 percent of his workforce's immigration status is verified.But Trump's sudden rise to political fame has helped the company, which already was paid $270,000 by the Trump campaign and that's just for one quarter.Overall the campaign spent $825,000 on merchandise, which means about one-third went to the popular ballcaps.The relationship is mutually beneficial too.Trump can tout an American-made product, as he tamped down early rumors that the hats were made in China.He's also able to show that he has a potent small donor base, as the hats only go for $25 a pop.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3333925/Donald-Trump-s-Make-America-Great-hats-Latinos-relax-legal.html,

But thanks to resources on the internet, we have some answers.Here’s the Trump merch that IS made in America.The Hillary Clinton campaign took aim at Trump’s trademark campaign slogan hats in August 2016, but it turns out the hats themselves were at least partially produced here in the states. The hats are hand-stitched in California, reports AP. But a fabric analysis and a conversation with two of the manufacturer’s employees and a top sales agent determined that “the hats’ fabric, bills and stiffeners were imported.”Trump water, “one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world,” according to Trump’s website, is sourced in Vermont and New York.*The Washington Post reported Trump’s bedding comforters are made in the U.S., but the link cited is no longer active. The bedding used in Trump’s hotels is, according to the Downlite website, “filled and finished in the USA of imported materials,” while the shell is made in China. So these get half a point, we guess.Here’s all the Trump merch that is NOT made in America.Ivanka Trump deals so much with foreign factories to source her clothing, it was even reported that her brand imported 53 metric tons of Chinese goods during her father’s “Buy American Hire American” speech.Trump’s brand made headlines in June for acknowledging its work with a shoe factory in which two men were arrested while investigating her supply chain, but simply stated the brand had since distanced itself from said factory.You do remember that David Letterman segment, in which Letterman not only asks Trump where his ties are made but then informs him they are made in China, don’t you?Facebook user Mary Cummins shared an image of a Donald Trump suit back in 2015 with a label that reads “Made in Mexico.” Other suits are reportedly made in Indonesia, according to Buzzfeed.The fact that Trump makes chandeliers in the first place, let alone chandeliers that cost more than $1,000, is not surprising. Neither is the fact that they are, at least in part, made in China, according to Amazon.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-made-in-america_us_596f9be6e4b01696c6a24918,

While shocked to discover that the caps were made in China, they still bought some, hoping no one would notice.On Trump’s official campaign website, the caps are, reportedly, indeed American-made and are priced around $25-$30. The variety sold by vendors in Washington on Friday, however, were much less expensive, with most going for just $20.Just like the ones Joshua Rojas and Alyssa Young bought during the event.“I loved it as soon as I saw it. I bought it right over there from one of the vendors for $20,” Young told Reuters. Asked if her hat was American-made, she replied, “I don’t know where it was made actually.”To check, she flipped her hat and looked at the label.  “Oh no,” said Young sounded disappointed. “It’s made in Vietnam!”Others also made similar discoveries in “horror”, finding out that some of the hats were made in China, some in Vietnam and the others in Bangladesh.And while many were disappointed, some of them actually did not seem to mind (or get) the irony.",https://nextshark.com/trumps-supporters-shocked-discovering-caps-actually-made-china/,

It shows the purchase of 1,488 yards of U.S.-origin, red polyester-cotton blended fabric, called Saxtwill, from Carr Textile Corp. of Fenton, Missouri. Kennedy later provided copies of three other certificates from Carr Textile, dated September 2015, for components of black and white hats of U.S. origin.Kennedy declined to comment further after the AP told him that a microscopic analysis of the fabric in a red cap the AP purchased directly from Trump’s campaign website did not match the red Saxtwill material that the AP obtained directly from Carr Textile. He said providing any further detail would reveal proprietary information.To do the microscopic analysis, the AP obtained samples directly from Carr of the same red polyester-cotton blended fabric that Kennedy said was in the hats: one type imported and one U.S.-made. The AP asked Deborah Young, a professor of textiles and clothing at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, to compare two Trump hats that the AP had purchased from the campaign website with the fabric samples. The AP did not identify the fabric samples to prevent bias.Her conclusion: The material in one Trump hat was inconsistent with either Carr sample.

To counteract this, Trump has pledged a 45% tariff on imports from China if he becomes elected.But Trump is a businessman, which means that he himself has made the exact decision many businesses make — one that utilizes the cheaper manufacturing systems abroad versus finding a way to do it in the United States. As he said in the March 10 GOP debate , Frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries...it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it.So how many of Trump's products — campaign-related and otherwise — are actually manufactured in the United States?

Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are ""bad"" or not, there is no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States.",Donald Trump says Mexican government 'forces many bad people into our country',"In a July 8 interview with NBC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump didn’t ease up his rhetoric about Mexican immigration -- at all.The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart, he told interviewer Katy Tur. They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems.In the interview, Trump left no doubt that he believes the Mexican government is taking an active role in pushing migrants into the United States: He used the word forcing four times to describe what the government was doing.But is it really the government forcing Mexicans across the border, rather than individual decisions to leave, either to seek employment or to join family members in the United States?A range of immigration experts told PolitiFact that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. (The Mexican Embassy did not respond to our inquiries, nor did a Trump representative.)For evidence, let’s start with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns.The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey finds Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong.He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career.What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact.Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’  Massey said. Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border.Immigrants come to work or to join family, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave.No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object, added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration.Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980.While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups, Smith said.But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added.About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is forcing people to leave.It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said.Trump does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population, Massey said. People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate.In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well.Trump said the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country. Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are bad or not, there is no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States.

This is pertinent when examining President Donald Trump’s statements on Mexico. Trump’s many mischaracterizations threaten $500 billion in annual trade, U.S.-Mexico relations, and America’s national interests.The United States has a vital national interest in continuing to avoid hostile or failed states on its borders. A prolonged crisis with Mexico — not least because of effects on ordinary Americans and U.S. domestic politics — would inevitably divert the administration’s time, attention, and resources away from other U.S. core national interests — including working with allies to contain China’s hegemonic ambitions in Asia and Russia’s neo-imperial policies in Europe, as well as to successfully combat international terrorism. While U.S.-Mexico relations have long been stable, Trump’s “alternative facts” could reverse this record. Here we evaluate six of the president’s untrue assertions about Mexico, showing the dangers they pose to the United States and to the U.S.-Mexico relationship.1. “Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization — moving our jobs, our wealth, and our factories to Mexico….” — Campaign speech on trade in Monessen, Pennsylvania, June 28, 2016.From 2000 to 2016, the number of U.S. manufacturing plants fell from 398,837 to 345,206 and the number of manufacturing jobs fell from 17.3 million to 12.3 million. Yet while factory flight to Mexico preoccupies the president, most research suggests that improved productivity, not job movement across borders, eliminated the majority of those 5 million lost jobs. A 2015 Ball State University report attributed 87 percent of job losses to productivity gains but only 13 percent to international trade. Economists finding trade-related losses fault competition from China for killing 985,000 manufacturing jobs, and not Mexico, whose exports support U.S. jobs: $0.40 of every dollar of U.S. imports from Mexico originates in the United States, and 63.7 percent of those imports are industrial inputs or investment goods. U.S. firms integrate Mexican and U.S. supply chains to improve efficiency and reduce prices. Attempting to restore jobs with tariffs would jeopardize the positions that U.S. exports to Mexico create, make U.S. manufacturing less competitive, fail to address automation’s effects on employment, and estrange an important trade partner.2. “NAFTA is the worst trade deal…. Thousands of jobs [are] leaving.” — First presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, Sept. 26, 2016.From 1994 to 2000, after NAFTA was enacted but before the 2001 recession and the reduction of investment restrictions in China, U.S. manufacturing employment rose from 16.8 million jobs to 17.3 million. While estimates vary, research suggests NAFTA had a modest but positive effect on the U.S. economy. A 2014 study by U.S. International Trade Commission economists found that NAFTA slightly increases national real wages and employment in the U.S. machinery and metal industries, while slightly decreasing employment in the sugar and apparel sectors. Still, for certain regions, especially the southeast, NAFTA has stronger negative wage effects. Nevertheless, protectionist policies would harm consumers and eliminate jobs. Trade-related underemployment can be addressed with adjustment assistance and training programs, but tariffs would cause major economic dislocations.3. “Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border.” — Republican primary debate, Dec. 15, 2015.Net migration from Mexico to the United States has been negative since the 2008 recession. The Pew Research Center estimates that the U.S. Mexican immigrant population fell from 12.8 million in 2007 to 11.7 million in 2014. Most exiting immigrants were undocumented. The number of apprehensions of Mexican migrants at U.S. borders also fell from 1,637,000 in 2000 to 188,000 in 2015, reaching a low level not seen since 1969. Trump’s proposal to build a border wall, with an estimated cost of $12-22 billion, would address an issue substantially diminishing in severity.4. “The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country … and they are drug dealers and … criminals of all kinds.” — Interview with Katy Tur, NBC, July 8, 2015.Evidence indicates that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens — 4.26 percent of the 1,526,800 U.S. federal and state prisoners in 2015 were non-citizens, even as the U.S. immigrant population share was 13.2 percent a year earlier. Moreover, of the “illegal aliens” convicted of federal crimes in 2015, nearly three-fourths were convicted of immigration-related offenses. Many studies show negative correlations between immigration and violent crime. Additionally, a 2015 American Immigration Council report found that only 2.8 percent of Mexican immigrant men age 18 to 39 were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of native-born men in that age range and 10.7 percent of those men without college degrees. Moreover, nothing supports the claim that the Mexican government sends criminals over the border. This accusation alienates Mexico, which spends millions of dollars trying to secure its southern border and detain Central American migrants attempting to enter the United States illegally.5. “Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border & WALL!” — Tweet, Aug. 27, 2016.Heroin flows from Mexico to the United States present a significant problem. U.S. heroin overdose deaths in recent years increased nearly 250 percent, from 3,036 in 2010 to 10,574 in 2014, and over three-fourths of heroin authorities seized in 2014 originated in Mexico. However, the United States spends billions of dollars annually on border security without reducing drug deaths. Working with Mexico on programs to reduce corruption and subsidize non-drug crops, which have received only $235 million since 2007, would help more than spending billions of dollars on a wall.6. “Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it’s a tax or whether it’s a payment.…” — First press conference as president-elect of the United States, Jan. 11, 2017.Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) faces tough 2018 elections due to rising gas prices and violence — Peña Nieto’s approval rating fell to 12 percent in January. Demanding that Mexico pay for a wall could force the PRI to take a more hostile stance against the United States to maintain power. Beyond trade wars, this could mean decreased cooperation with U.S. law enforcement and border security. Moreover, Trump’s commentary on Mexico has led to peso depreciation and reduced foreign investment. If Trump decreases U.S.-Mexico trade (worth 30 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product) and remittance flows (worth $2 billion per month) he could cause a Mexican recession and reduce Mexico’s ability to address violence and drug crime.The U.S.-Mexico relationship certainly has challenging problems, but Trump’s policy inventions could rupture ties and thus undermine vital U.S. national interests. “Alternative facts” may excite adoring crowds in political rallies, but they have no place in American foreign policy, including in U.S.-Mexico relations.",http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/28/fact-checking-trumps-alternative-facts-about-mexico/,

Our Southern neighbor has offered the state aid and assistance to help recover from the catastrophic floods.They might have gone with “When you go low, we go high.”That’s because the Mexican government made the offer even though President Donald Trump used the weekend to continue to insist he’d find a way to force Mexico to pay for a wall along the Southern border, something the country has no intention of doing.Mexico’s response to the president’s tweets was concise and consistent. On Sunday night the foreign ministry issued a formal statement. “As the government of Mexico has always maintained, our country will not pay for, under any circumstances ... a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border.”But the statement didn’t stop there, despite the American president’s insistence on the wall:The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States for the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and express that we have offered the US government help and cooperation to be provided by different Mexican government agencies to deal with the impacts of this natural disaster — as good neighbors should always do in difficult times.On Sunday evening, the Dallas Morning News reported, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray also spoke to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and verbally reiterated the country’s offer of aid.On Wednesday the Texas governor said his state would accept the offer.This will not be the first time Mexico has offered disaster assistance to the United States.In 2005, following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, the Mexican government sent soldiers, medical personnel, engineers, and aid to the stricken citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi. They carried with them safe drinking water and food.As the Washington Post reported on Monday, “By the end of their three-week operation in Louisiana and Mississippi, the Mexicans had served 170,000 meals, helped distribute more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations.”It’s an image of Mexico completely at odds with the one Donald Trump has promoted since he launched his run for the White House.The question is whether Texans remember any of that the next time they head to the polls. In 2016, the state went for Trump — and his harsh anti-Mexican rhetoric — giving the president 52.2 percent of the vote.",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/29/16222160/mexico-aid-hurricane-harvey-trump-wall-tweets,

So when our Commander in Cheif said that Hispanics were bringing drugs, crime and rapists into this country during his campaign, it was difficult not to take it personally.In an interview on All In with Chris Hayes on Wednesday, July 8, 2015, Trump said The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they`re smart. They`re smarter than our leaders. When he was asked to provide any evidence for these claims during an interview on CNN's The Situation Room, he got his information from a Fusion article.Lemon then explained that article actually said 80 percent of women and girls from Central America are raped by human smugglers, gang members other migrants or government authorities while immigrating to the U.S. However, despite being corrected, Trump shot back dismissing the victims and suggesting Latino immigrants were the ones raping the victims.In my experience, if anything, Hispanics are some of the hardest working and family oriented people I know.Recent events in Texas with Hurricane Harvey have shed light on the fact that while Trump wants to build a wall, Mexico is a friendly neighbor in times of hardship that we may not want to be too quick to fence ourselves off from.According to Dallas News, on Wednesday, the state is accepting Mexico's offer to help get Texas back on its feet in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.This was in response to Mexico's diplomatic proposition on Tuesday, providing a long list of items it could supply, including troops, convoys of food, medicine, portable showers and water.This was very similar to their response to Hurricane Katrina victims in September 2005 where former diplomat Stephen R. Kelly wrote, This time, however, the Mexican soldiers were on a relief mission to feed tens of thousands of homeless and hungry Americans displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Setting up camp at a former Air Force base outside San Antonio, they distributed potable water, medical supplies, and 7,000 hot meals a day for the next three weeks.Does this sound like a problem or a solution?Are Mexicans really as bad as President Trump makes them out to be, or is he just spewing divisive narrative to serve fear and encourage a mob mentality to elect someone who just tells it as it is, even if that someone has no idea what he is really talking about.",https://www.theodysseyonline.com/hurricane-harvey-and-hispanics-trump-was-wrong,

(END VIDEOTAPE)  HAYES: Good evening from New York. I`m Chris Hayes.  Well, the more Donald Trump`s business empire continues to suffer, as a result of his comments about undocumented immigrants, the more his political future seems to brighten. The celebrity chef Jose Andres announced today he is backing out of a deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump`s forthcoming new hotel in Washington, D.C., adding to a growing list of businesses to cut ties with Trump over remarks many have seen as offensive.   At the same time, a brand new poll today from left-leaning Public Policy Polling shows trump in first place, first place in North Carolina, among GOP primary voters, more evidence he is a force to be reckoned with in the Republican field.   NBC correspondent Katy Tur got a chance to sit down with the candidate earlier today. What follows is one of the most bizarre political interviews I`ve ever seen.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  KATY TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Why are we in New York? Why aren`t we out in the campaign trail?  TRUMP: Oh, I`ve been to Iowa many times. I`ve been to New Hampshire many, many times. I love the people there and we`ve had tremendous success. We`ve had tremendous crowds.  Nobody gets as many standing ovations and, you know, I spent a lot of time out.   I was in South Carolina recently and we`re all over.   I`m going -- this weekend, I`ll be with Clint Eastwood in California. A tremendous group of people.   I`m going to Arizona this weekend. I`ll be all over the place.   TUR: You were one of the only candidates who didn`t campaign during the Fourth of July. Pretty much all of them were in New Hampshire. You were there. You had no campaign events really this week. No campaign events planned for next week that we know of so far.  You`re not campaigning that much. How can anybody take you seriously if you`re not out there showing your face?  TRUMP: Because I`m doing television with you and I am up there actually a lot. And I watch them up there walking the streets, and it didn`t mean anything. I was actually getting more news coverage than anybody else by far because I`m the one that brought up the whole situation and the whole mess with immigration and what the Mexican government is doing to us.   So, you know, I didn`t have to be and I would have been if they wanted me to. And I just decided that probably it wasn`t necessary. I`m going up actually next week and I`ll be in Iowa many times over the next couple of months and New Hampshire many, many times.   TUR: Let`s talk immigration since that`s the hot topic. Yesterday, there was news coming out from The Washington Post about your hotel site in D.C. There are a lot of immigrants working on that, including some who say --   TRUMP: Legal immigrants.   TUR: -- that they are not here -- they`re not legally here. Do you --   TRUMP: They didn`t say that. If you read the article it really doesn`t say that. In fact, the writer was very surprised that they weren`t able to find anybody. We have a very strong system.   I have a contractor, that`s one of the biggest in the nation doing it. So far, they`re doing a very job. They have a very strong verification system. And the whole story was about, you know, they thought they were going to find people and they weren`t able to find --   TUR: They did find some people who said that they were undocumented.   TRUMP: Well, they certainly didn`t write them down and write their names and we`re very strong on that. And, you know, with 11 million to 31 million illegal immigrants in the country, it`s pretty hard to be in a position where you actually can`t find anybody.   That`s going to be a fantastic job. That was sitting there for years, like 30 years, empty, vacant, a disastrous situation. I took it over. We`re going to have one of the great hotels of the world. We`re also very proud of the building and the building practices.   TUR: Are you concerned for the people working for you to put these buildings up? One of the workers told The Washington Post, Do you think that we`re hanging out of the eighth floor window and raping or selling drugs? We`re risking our lives and our health. These fumes are toxic.  Do you have a reaction to that when somebody says that about your job site?   TRUMP: No. I was totally misquoted. I could read. I could give you a copy of the speech. I could read it to you.  I was so misquoted that it`s incredible. I`m talking about the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they`re smart. They`re smarter than our leaders and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn`t believe. They`re forcing people into our country.   This guy that killed the wonderful young woman from San Francisco, he went back to Mexico, they forced him out. They forced people into our country. And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds.   We are taking Mexico`s problems. Mexico is beating us on trade and beating us at the border. But Mexico doesn`t want to take these people. So, what do they do? They send them to our stupid politicians and we have sanctuary cities and all of this nonsense.   I`ve been saying this a long time, Katy, and it is a disgrace. And, frankly, if I didn`t bring it up, you wouldn`t even be talking about immigration right now.   TUR: When was the last time you were at the border?  TRUMP: I`ve been to the border three or four times over the years. And I have many people that live around the area. I`m going to Arizona this weekend where they want to talk to me because Arizona is -- somebody said I`m the most popular person in Arizona because of my stance. And I`m going to be there this weekend.  TUR: When was the last time that you were there?   TRUMP: Probably three years ago.   TUR: So, how do you -- if you haven`t been there in three years, how do you know that it is such --   TRUMP: Because I knew it was bad then and it is worse now. It was terrible then and it`s worse now. It`s worse now than it`s ever been.   We don`t even have a border. People are just flowing through like water. There was no border right now.  TUR: The murder rate in El Paso, Texas, right on the border, is the lowest murder rate for any of the big cities in the country.   TRUMP: Don`t try to convince me that there is no crime, that it`s wonderful.   The people that are being forced in, and these aren`t just Mexican people. The people being forced, Mexico doesn`t want people. They are forcing them into our country. And we`re taking them and we`re putting them in our jails and our hospitals and we`re paying them money through different sources.   It is a disgrace. Don`t tell me about safety. Are you trying to justify safety on the border? I don`t think so.  TUR: We have a lower incarceration rate for Mexican immigrants and illegal immigrants than we do any U.S.-born citizens.   TRUMP: It`s a wrong statistic. Go check your numbers. It`s totally wrong. It sounds good.   TUR: It`s Pew Research.   TRUMP: It sounds good. It`s a wrong statistic. Check your numbers.   TUR: So, do you think --   TRUMP: And by the way, I`m not -- I have great relationship with the Mexican people. I have many people working for me. You can look at the job in Washington. I have many legal immigrants working for me. Many of them come from Mexico. They love me. I love them.   And I`ll tell you something. If I get the nomination, I`ll win the Latino vote. I will win it, because I`m going to create jobs.   Hillary Clinton is not going to be able to create jobs, I will tell you right now. Neither is Jeb Bush going to create jobs. I will create jobs and the Latinos will have jobs they don`t have right now. And I will win that vote, and everyone thinks, oh, gee, Trump is going to not do well with that vote. I`ll do better with vote than anybody. I have thousands of them working for me in different places that I have all over the country. I will win that vote.   TUR: Why -- why should people believe your numbers when you come out and say they`re committing crimes and they`re in our jails and they`re murdering us and taking our jobs? A few years ago, you led the birther movement. You sent investigators out to Hawaii to find out whether or not Obama was not born here. And it turned out to not be true.   TRUMP: Well, I don`t know. According to you it`s not true. I don`t know.   TUR: He released his birth certificate.   TRUMP: You know, if you believe that, it`s fine. I don`t care. It`s an old subject.   I`m about jobs, I`m about security, I`m about fixing the military, I`m about taking care of our vets. I`m about things that you don`t to have bring up old subjects.   Whether he did or not, who knows? A lot of people don`t agree with you on that, by the way. But I`m really about economic development and I`m about jobs. That`s what we have to start talking about.   And I`m about beating ISIS militarily and not acting like a bunch of babies like we`re acting right now.  TUR: Do you have a plan for ISIS?   TRUMP: I do have a plan actually.  TUR: What is it?  TRUMP: I would knock the hell out of oil areas because they`re rich as can be. They`re building a hotel in Iraq. They took over a hotel. They`re renovating a hotel in Iraq. They`re renovating another hotel in a different location. They have nothing but money. It is coming out of their ears and they`re getting most of their money from oil.   TUR: Would you send ground troops?  TRUMP: And if you remember -- excuse me, Katy -- if you remember, number one, I said you shouldn`t go into Iraq any way because you`re going to destabilize the Middle East, that`s exactly what happened. Then I said, once you`re in, if you`re leaving, keep the oil.   Well, ISIS has the oil. And Iran has the oil. If they would have listened to me, and I was very strong. The Bush people in 2004 sent people to my office because they didn`t want me to say what I was saying. And I`m more into the military, by the way, than anybody. But you have to know when and where to use the military.   We made a tremendous mistake. We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place, who I love, by the way, all over the place. And what do we have?   We`re not even there anymore. And Iran is taking over Iraq. In fact, they`re meeting right now. Iran is taking over Iraq.   We got nothing for it. Zero. And it is really a sad situation. With ISIS, you kill them at the head. You take the oil. That`s where they`re getting their money. If you bomb the hell out of it, you bomb the hell out of it. You`ve got to stop their wealth. They have tremendous wealth.  TUR: What about civilians?   TRUMP: I`m talking about oil. I`m talking about oil areas. I`m not talking about civilian areas.   TUR: Civilians are near oil areas.   TRUMP: Oh, give me a break, Katy. Go ahead. Next question.  TUR: Let`s say domestically, a lot of people are killed by gun violence in this country. What would you do about that?   TRUMP: You have a lot of people that are killed by guns. But I`m a big Second Amendment person. You know, when the prisoners escaped up in New York, which was a tragedy in itself, people that were against guns said, thank God we have guns.   I remember seeing on television a woman saying, I was always fighting with my husband. He wanted guns. He felt so strongly about guns and I would fight him. Now, we have a gun on drawer, a gun in every table in case these guys broke into this house.   It`s very interesting. No, I`m a Second Amendment person.  TUR: What about people that walk into churches and shoot people, or walk in the schools and shoot people?   TRUMP: They`re sick people. Those are very, very sick people. They`ll be able to get something somewhere.   TUR: Are you not more concerned about them than illegal immigrants coming in here and killing people?  TRUMP: I`m concerned about everything. I`m concerned about the country. Our country is going to hell.   I`m concerned about everything, OK? Our country is being beaten in trade deals by China, by Japan, by Mexico. Mexico is the new China. Mexico is killing us in trade.  We`re being beaten at every front. We`re being beaten militarily. We have a military that every time we send equipment to our so-called allies, one bullet is shot in the air. We lost 2,300 armor-plated Humvees, not two or three or seven. We lost 2,000 -- in one day, 2,300 Humvees. I say, that`s impossible. How can you lose that many?   TRUMP: A bullet gets fired into the air and the people that we`re giving these Humvees to, they run like bandits and the enemy takes them over. The enemy has better equipment than we have because we`re foolish.   TUR: You`re for the second amendment. Do you have a gun in.   TRUMP: I have the license to have a gun. Yes, I do.   TUR: Do you own one?   TRUMP: Yes, I do.   TUR: Do you use it? Gun range?   TRUMP: That`s none of your business. It`s really none of your business. I have a license to have a gun.   TUR: Gun control.   TRUMP: What are you talking about?   TUR: Or stronger background checks.   TRUMP: Yes, I have a gun. Excuse me, yes, I have a gun and yes, I have a permit to have a gun.   TUR: Stronger back ground checks. What about that? Is there any steps that you would make it harder to get a gun?   TRUMP: The problem is once you get into that, you start getting into a situation, the slippery slope where all of a sudden, you`re going to violate the Second Amendment. I don`t want to do anything on violate the Second Amendment. To me, the Second Amendment is very important.   TUR: I want to talk about some -- what some of the Republicans have been saying about you just this week. You`ve been very divisive for the party. You have Charles Krauthammer who`s called you a rodeo clown.  TRUMP: Well, Charles Krauthammer is a totally overrated person, who really dislikes personally. I never met him. I mean, he is a totally overrated guy, doesn`t know what he`s doing.  He was in favor of the war in Iraq. He wanted to go into Iraq and he wanted to stay there forever.   So, you know, these are overrated people. I see who it is. You can mention name after name.   By the way, are you going to mention the ones that do like Trump? You don`t do that, do you?  TUR: Goldberg has compared to a failed man who mistook flattery for insight. George Will --   TRUMP: If I`m a failed man, I`m worth a fortune. I built -- you know, what`s interesting? I went to best school, got the best, great marks, everything else, I went out and made a fortune, a big fortune, tremendous fortune. I`ll be announcing that in about a week because I have to file my papers, bigger than people even understand. I have a book called The Art of the Deal. I do The Apprentice. The Art of the Deal was like the number one business book of all time, or just about. I think it was.   And I do The Apprentice and NBC is angry at me because they renew The Apprentice and I wouldn`t do it, and that`s one of the reasons that NBC is so angry with me.  And then I get called by a guy that can`t buy a pair of pants, I get called names. Give me a break.  TUR: So, you will release your financials on time.   TRUMP: Yes. I think we`re going to have it on time. In fact --   TUR: Eight days from now.   TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. I`m allowed a 45-day extension and another 45-day extension. I don`t expect to be using the extensions. You know, on time is really not on time, because you`re allowed automatically two 45-day extensions. I don`t think I`m going to be using them.   I should be filing. They`re very complicated. You know, these papers were not meant for me because of the complexity and the bigness of what I have. But we should be releasing them ahead of schedule.   TUR: Where did you get your money from?   TRUMP: I made it the old-fashioned way, in real estate, in real estate. I made a lot of money doing everything I did. I made a lot of money with The Apprentice. I made a lot of money in real estate. I made a lot of money -- everything I did. I`ve had great success.   TUR: What about the company that have backed away from you? Nine by our counts. If you want to count the city of New York that`s looking at its contracts, 10.  Are you concerned that you`re going to come to a point where you`re going to lose so much business that this isn`t worth it?   TRUMP: Now, I`m not concerned. Let me tell you what`s worth. If it weren`t for immigration, OK, you wouldn`t even hear the word immigration if it wasn`t for Donald Trump. Immigration is a word. Illegal immigration, I brought up the whole subject up.   In fact, your friends at FOX gave great credit for that the other day. They said, if it wasn`t for Donald Trump, we wouldn`t even be talking about illegal immigration or even immigration right now.   And I`ve been given -- and then you had the horrible tragedy in San Francisco with the young woman who was shot with a person that should have never been here.   Now, this is too important. Yes, I`m losing some contracts. Who cares? People politically, they are weak and they want to be politically correct. Some of them have already apologized to me. They made a mistake.   And you know what? That`s fine, because compared to what I have. First of all, my company is a massive company and it`s a very rich company. But compared to what I have, it doesn`t matter.   Most importantly -- even if it was a huge amount of money, I would still do this. Now, when people run for -- as an example, when these people are running for president, they don`t lose anything. A politician doesn`t lose anything when he or she runs for president. They run, they lose, they win, they don`t lose anything.  When I run, as a successful person, I lose a tremendous amount. I mean, the kind of money that I lose on all these deals that you`re reading about, now, a lot of them are blown out of proportion, like they had ESPN. ESPN said, do you know what it was? It was a ballroom evening. An evening in a ballroom, that`s already replaced.   They have NASCAR left. That was another thing. I guess ESPN maybe was a little golf tournament. NASCAR was a ballroom, it was a banquet. They make it a tremendous deal.   TUR: If it`s hurting you, why do it?  TRUMP: Katy, let me just say, the press is very, very dishonest. And I think people are wiser than the press.  TUR: If it`s hurting you, why do it?   TRUMP: Because I want to make America great again. Honestly, very simple, our country is in trouble. We owe $18 trillion going up to $21 trillion very soon. Once we`re $24 trillion, we are Greece. We are Greece on steroids. We are large scale version.  I want to make our country great again. We have the potential to have that great spirit that we once had. We don`t have it anymore. Our country is a mess.   (END VIDEOTAPE)  HAYES: Much more of Katy Tur`s interview with the man apparently making a lot of sense to a fair number of Republican primary voters, Donald Trump, coming up. Including his response to charges he`s damaging the Republican Party, and his plan to beef up security on the Mexican border.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I will make that wall impenetrable, OK? Impenetrable. You don`t have to worry about how high it will be. And Mexico will pay for that wall.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Everybody come in, killers, criminals, drug dealers, everybody. If you listen to Hillary, everybody is going to be flowing through the nation. They are sort of now anyway. But if you listen to Hillary, she is so weak on immigration. We will have a crime wave like you`ve never seen before.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  HAYES: Donald Trump`s opinion of his potential competition and much, much more, when we come back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Ask yourself this thought experiment. If Donald Trump were a Democratic mole placed in the Republican Party to disrupt things, how would his behavior be different? I don`t think it would be.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  HAYES: Conservative commentator George Will just one of the member of the Republican establishment to criticize Donald Trump`s impact on this party.  In his interview with NBC News correspondent Katy Tur, Trump fired back.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  TUR: George Will said you could be a Democratic operative.   TRUMP: George Will is another one. He was in Mar-A-Lago years ago. He spoke. I didn`t want to listen to him speak and he`s never forgiven me for the fact that I didn`t show up, because I find him to a very boring guy. So, why do I want to listen to George Will for?  I listen to the people. I get the biggest crowds, I get the biggest standing ovations, and I guess you see it in the poll numbers.   And I don`t even care about it. Look, maybe I`m wasting my time and it costs me some money in terms of some deals. The big money is the opportunity, because while I`m wasting time talking to you, which is, you know, essentially one sided, but that`s fine. But while I`m wasting time talking to you, I could be doing deals on other things, so I`m losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars.   Nobody else loses. When they run for office, they don`t lose. A politician doesn`t lose. I do lose. But I want to make -- I mean, just to answer the question. I`m running because I want to make our country great again.   TUR: Republicans say that you`re hurting the party. Do you think you`re hurting the party? If you divide them so severely, will you be able to get the nomination and then become president?   TRUMP: Well, on FOX, they say that I did a great service, because I`m the one that brought up the whole discussion on immigration and I think I`m helping the party greatly.   And I actually think that -- if you look at Mitt Romney, who was a great disappointment because he ran a terrible campaign and especially in the last month, he totally collapsed, he choked. Something happened to him but he choked, pure and simple.   If you look at him, many of the conservative Republicans just stayed home. They didn`t want to do anything. I mean, they stayed home, they didn`t vote for him.  If those people got out and voted, he would have won. But you had a lot of Republicans and conservative Republicans stay home because they weren`t energized.   TUR: The Latino vote ultimately --   (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Let me tell but the Latino vote. I will win the Latino vote because I`m going to put them to work. I`m going to be able to get jobs. I will take jobs back from China, I`ll take jobs back from Japan, where they`re making so many cars -- I mean, millions and millions of cars. What do we get? We send very little to Japan by comparison.   I`ll take jobs back from Mexico. Mexico is going to become the car capital of the world the way they`re building.   Ford is now building a $2.5 billion plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico. They`re going to sell cars in the United States and parts and trucks in the United States. Excuse me, how does that help us?   In Tennessee, they just lost a plan that was going to be built in Tennessee. It went to Mexico.   So, Mexico is going to take care of their people because as I said before, their leaders are smarter than our leaders and their negotiators are far better. And that will never happen if I`m president.   TUR: You have 17 percent of the population that is Latino. A lot of them say they`re very offended by what you`re saying was a misquote from yours or a misunderstanding.   TRUMP: Not a misquote. No, it was --   (CROSSTALK)  TUR: Do you want to apologize?   TRUMP: No, there`s nothing to apologize for. There`s nothing to apologize for.   Read my statement. My statement is referring to Mexico and they`re pushing a lot of bad people into our country and we`re taking care of a lot of criminals that shouldn`t be in our country. And you saw that the other day in San Francisco. We`re taking care of these people.   When people read my quote, they say, oh, it`s sort of interesting. I made my presidential announcement right here in this building. I made it. Everybody gave me great reviews -- some great, great reviews, some good reviews.   It wasn`t until a week later that people started criticizing that one statement. And I`m referring to Mexico.   I have great respect for the country of Mexico. I love the Mexican people and their spirit. But the country of Mexico is killing us. The country of Mexico is taking our jobs. They`re killing us at the border. They`re taking advantage of the fact that we have stupid negotiators.   We have very stupid people in our country negotiating for us. And we have leaders that don`t know what they`re doing. So, I respect that. I`m not angry at Mexico. I`m angry at our leadership for not putting our right people to negotiate.   TUR: Why wouldn`t you keep your manufacturing here? Your ties, your suits, why would you not have them made here?   TRUMP: Because China so manipulates their currency that it`s very hard to find companies that can do business in the United States.   TUR: You`re a billionaire though. Why would you not move it here just for having it in America?   TRUMP: Excuse me, because I`m a businessman.   Let me just tell you something and it`s very interesting. You`re not bringing anything new. You`re acting like you`re the great reporter, blah blah blah.   You`re not bringing -- every speech I make, I talk about I always hate that I have to have my ties made in China. And do you know why they`re made in China? Because China manipulates their currency to such a degree.   They just manipulated it again two weeks ago. I never thought I would see it so fast again and again.   They`re taking our jobs, they`re taking our manufacturing, they`re destroying us. By the way, we`re rebuilding China.   Do you know what they do? They loan us back the money. We owe $1.4 trillion to China.  So, they take our jobs, they take our manufacturing, and then they give us money and we have to pay them interest.   TUR: How do you get that money back? How do you recover from this?   TRUMP: You take jobs back from China. You take jobs back from Japan. You charge Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia makes a billion dollars a day. Every time there`s -- if you think these people were after Yemen, they`re not after Yemen. They`re after the oil in Saudi Arabia.   You take a look at that border. This was the country that Barack Obama said, oh, wow, we had a great victory in Yemen. Great victory, it`s all over. Great victory, right?  A week later, it totally blew up in his face. That border is a long border right along Saudi Arabia. You look at what happens. Just like I predicted what was going to happen in Iraq and all these other candidates that I`m running, they just (INAUDIBLE) -- you look at somebody like Jeb Bush. It took him five days, five days, to give a proper answer on Iraq. He was changing his answer every day.   How is somebody like that going on negotiate with?   TUR: International diplomacy is a delicate thing. You have to watch what you say. And how can anybody expect that you`ll get into the White House and watch your mouth when you were so widely panned for these Mexico comments? How were you going to be hold your tongue and not anger other countries?   TRUMP: So, I will tell you this. I made a lot of money against China. I made a lot of money in all of these countries. I have great relationships with these countries.   If you take a look at what is going on in terms of relationship with the United States, everybody hates us.   Hillary Clinton was the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States. Hillary was the worst in the history of the United States. There is never been a secretary of state so bad as Hillary.   The world blew up around us. We lost everything including all relationships. There wasn`t one good thing that came out of that administration or her being secretary of state.   I have great relationships. If you look at Businessweek magazine, they did a story on the 10 things that China most wants. One of the 10 things, anything Trump. Anything Trump. And I`m the toughest critic there is on China.   People have to respect you.   TUR: What do you think of Hillary Clinton as the president if she wins the nomination --   TRUMP: I think she would be a terrible president. She was the worst secretary of state in the history of our nation. Why would she be a good president? I think she would be a terrible president.   TUR: She says you`re too divisive on immigration. The Republican Party is too divisive on immigration.   TRUMP: Hillary is weak on immigration. I may be divisive on immigration, but she`s weak on immigration, which is far worse.   Hillary would let everybody coming in -- killer, criminals, drug dealers, everybody. If you listen to Hillary, everybody is going to be flowing through nation. They are sort of now any way. But if you listen to Hillary, she is so weak on immigration, we will have a crime wave like you`ve never seen before.  TUR: Immigration is down. Why is this such a big topic for you right now?   TRUMP: Immigration is a very big topic. Take a look at all the crime that`s being committed. Go take a look at -- look, I`m going to Arizona --   TUR: The research says the crime does not match what you`re saying.   TRUMP: It depends on whose research.  TUR: The research -- the Pew Research, which is independent, says --   TRUMP: Don`t be naive. You`re a very naive person.   TUR: The Pew Research says that there for immigrants on the whole --   TRUMP: Come on, try getting it out. Try getting it out.   TUR: I`ll get it out.   TRUMP: I mean, I don`t know if you`re going to put on this television, but you don`t even know what you`re talking about. Try getting it out. Go ahead.  TUR: Immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born citizens. There are less immigrants on our jails than --  TRUMP: You know what, number one, I disagree with it, and number two, whether it is true or not, illegal immigrants -- I`m talking about illegal immigrants. I`m talking about illegal. I`m an immigrant, you`re an immigrant, we`re all immigrants... TUR: Illegal immigrants commit less crime -- other than coming through illegally. TRUMP: I`m talking about illegal immigrants are causing tremendous crime, tremendous crime. And nobody wants to talk about it. And that`s why Fox, at least Fox. And you won`t believe this perhaps, but at least Fox is being honest because they`re now talking about it. And if I didn`t bring up the subject a number of weeks ago, we wouldn`t even be talking about illegal immigration right now. TUR: If you found out that you had an illegal immigrant working for you and they are a hard worker, how would you treat them? TRUMP: I think that I would treat them probably -- I would have to tell them, you have to go back, I think. TUR: What if they were supporting their family? TRUMP: I would probably tell them you have to go back. I mean, they`re illegal immigrants. I probably would say you have to go back. Do I like doing that? No. I`m a nice person believe it or not. I mean, I have a heart. But I would probably tell them, you have to go back. Look, we have anywhere 11 to 31 million -- our country doesn`t even know, can you believe the statistics are from 11 to 31 million illegal immigrants in our country. We don`t even know. OK, we don`t even know. Nobody is able to tell me the number. It used to be 11 now. Now they think it`s 31 million. Nobody even knows. It is a very sad situation. But you have to create a strong border. And if I didn`t bring this up. TUR: Who pays for that wall? TRUMP: Mexico. TUR: How do you get Mexico to pay that wall? TRUMP: Only if I`m president. TUR: How does that happen? TRUMP: Because Mexico is making a fortune off the United States. I would get them to pay for the wall. Believe me they will pay for the wall. TUR: I just don`t understand how you would. TRUMP: And I watch all these pundits that don`t have brains, I watch all of them say, oh, Trump can`t get them -- I built a great empire through a negotiation. You have to be able to negotiate. Mexico is making a fortune off the United States, a fortune. In addition to sending a lot of people here, forcing, forcing, and I`m talking about their bad people. Again, I love the Mexican people. I love their spirit. Many of them work for me right now. I respect Mexico, but their leaders and their negotiators are too smart for our leaders and our negotiators? TUR: How high would the wall be? TRUMP: I will make that wall impenetrable. Impenetrable. You don`t have to worry about how high it will be and Mexico will pay for that wall. TUR: OK. TRUMP: Thank you very much. TUR: I really appreciate it. TRUMP: Thank you. A great honor. OK. TUR: It`s fun when you... TRUMP: Well, fun. It`s too bad that she mentions only the negatives, you don`t want to mention the positives. TUR: You know, let me ask you, put the mic back on. I`m going to ask you one more. I forgot to ask it.  TRUMP: What is it? TUR: I want to know why you think voters like you so much and why you`re getting big crowds. But your microphone is not on. TRUMP: That question I can handle.  TUR: You have two minutes left of tape. So, you say you`re drawing these big crowds and I was there. You drew a big crowd. TRUMP: The way you put it, everything is so negative I`m not saying I`m drawing -- you`re saying I`m drawing them. TUR: You`re number two. Why do people respond to you so much? TRUMP: Well, I`m actually number one in Huffington Post and some others and the new polls haven`t even come out yet. TUR: Why are they responding to you so much? TRUMP: Because I tell truth. I say what`s happening. I made a tremendous fortune. And that`s the kind of mentality we need in this country. Jeb Bush will never take us to the promise land. He doesn`t have it. Hillary will never take us to the promised land. Hillary will be a disaster as a president.  Jeb will be very poor as a president. No energy. We need somebody that can make great deals with China, with Japan, with Mexico. We need somebody that really understands and cherishes the military. I actually think I`ll be the jobs president, but I actually think I`ll be actually even better in term of the military.  I will create military where nobody is going to mess around with the United States.  TUR: do you think it is just name recognition? TRUMP: No. I think it`s the fact that I say things that people agree with. TUR: More people than maybe we expect to agree with you, or the establishment might expect? TRUMP: People like what I say, they agree with what I say. I have had tremendous success. If I didn`t have the success, I think it wouldn`t be the same thing. I`ve had tremendous success. They understand I`ve had tremendous success and they respect me. And what I`m telling -- I don`t need this. I don`t need this. What I`m doing this for the country. I want to make America great again. We have a last shot. If we keep going way it`s going, America is going to be permanently scarred. (END VIDEOTAPE) HAYES: All right, if you thought we were completely through the looking glass, hold on, we`re going to keep going further. Still ahead, reaction to Donald Trump`s immigration comments from none other than the man who used to run that country, the former president, Felipe Calderon of Mexico. Stick around. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HAYES: We have a response from Donald Trump`s presidential campaign to the interview we just ran with NBC`s Katy Tur, which included an exchange concerning a Washington Post story about a Trump hotel site in Washington, D.C. reportedly being built in part by undocumented immigrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The whole was about -- you know, they thought they were going to find people and they weren`t able to find anyone...  TUR: No, they did find some people who said that they were undocumented. TRUMP: Well, they certainly didn`t write them down and write their names. (END VIDEO CLIP)  HAYES: The Washington Post story did in fact find that many of the laborers at Trump`s hotel site said they had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. In a statement, the Trump campaign said that a contractor overseas construction of the site and that, quote, our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law. When we come back, I asked the former president of Mexico Felipe Calderon to respond to Trump`s claim that the Mexican government is sending Mexico`s worst citizens to America. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HAYES: One of the strangest claims Donald Trump has been making on immigration is that the Mexican government has some sort of an active program to select and then ship Mexican criminals and rapists to the U.S. Today, as we saw in his interview with Katy Tur, he was at it again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I`m talking about the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country, because they`re smart. They`re smarter than our leaders and their negotiators are far better than what we have like to a degree that you wouldn`t believe. They`re forcing people into our country. This guy that killed the wonderful young woman from San Francisco, he went back to Mexico. They forced him out. They force people into our country and they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico`s problems. (END VIDEO CILP) HAYES: Now, this afternoon I happened to be talking to the former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, the man who was head of the Mexican government from 2006 to 2012. And I asked him to responsibility to that claim. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FELIPE CALDERON, FRM. MEXICAN PRESIDENT: First, I don`t want to talk about this guy. He doesn`t deserve any more comment, because he is only trying to get votes. And I won`t provide him more attention. He doesn`t deserve it. I can comment in general on immigration. Mexican people are really hard working people everywhere. Probably we cannot understand the prosperity of the United States last century without the Mexican worker that came to here. You are talking about government like mine, let me tell you that through providing more opportunities for kids, for instance, we created in my tenure, more than 140 new universities, more than 1,100 new high schools, and all of them tuition free. And with that, for instance, Mexico is graduating more than 100,000 engineers a year which is providing an incredible boost in competitiveness for manufacturing industry and at the same time it is opening opportunities for kids. We build modern, almost 2,000 new hospitals pr clinics in Mexican territory in six years. We provided with health care for almost all the people there. For these reasons, I know there -- for instance even the recession in The States. The net rate of immigration of Mexican workers to U.S. went to zero two years in a row -- 2010, 2011, 2012. My first time ever.  So on the contrary, Mexican government are working really hard in order to provide to the Mexican people the opportunities. And I hope that in the future, the only way in which the people -- the people will not need to emigrate under the basis of necessity. So I strongly recommend to stay far away from the extremism that only are trying to sit -- to seat hate between countries that are friends, allies, neighbors, and the only way in which we can prosper both sides of the border is working together, putting aside all those voices that, because self interests in some cases, vested interests, just trying to separate us from this very important alliance we need to forge. (END VIDEO CLIP) HAYES: We`ll have more from my interview with former Mexican President Felipe Calderon in which we talk about things other than Donald Trump tomorrow. But first tonight, breaking news out of Baltimore as a police commissioner loses his job and Tom Selleck investigated over accusations of water theft during California`s drought. That`s ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HAYES: Big news out of Baltimore where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has fired the police commission of Baltimore following a reason surge of homicides. Commissioner Anthony Batts was dismissed today, replaced by deputy commissioner Kevin Davis until a permanent replacement is found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE, MAYOR OF BALTIMOER: With the utmost urgency that we get the crime surge under control, and when the focus is on repeatedly on the leadership, on who supports the leader, who doesn`t support the leader, that`s attention that we`re all taking away from the essential work that we all have to do together. (END VIDEO CLIP) HAYES: Now, the mayor`s decision came hours after the police union, the fraternal order of police, released a report that heavily criticized the police department leadership during last month`s rioting, which followed the deathof Freddie Gray who died after injuries receiving while in police custody. That police union, which has been quite critical of the mayor, also highlights a claim by the police department`s media section that there was a quote, credible threat by gang members against police officers. This on -- during the riots, a claim that was roundly debunked. The mayor, however, sharply criticized the police union report and said it did not play a role in her decision. Police say there have been 155 homicides this is year, a 48 percent increase over last year. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HAYES: Actor Tom Selleck has found himself caught up in his own personal Watergate. Accused of allegedly pilfering truck loads of water for his southern California estate. The California municipal water district filed suit Monday against actor Tom Selleck and his wife saying, Selleck had huge amounts of water from a public hydrant delivered to his sprawling Hidden Valley ranch, which contains an avocado farm. Now according to the suit, this has happened on more than a dozen occasions since 2013, even though the water district sent Selleck a pair of cease and desist letters. According to Monday`s complaint, as recently as March of this year, a commercial water truck was spotted filling up at the same public hydrant and delivering water to Selleck`s estate. Calleguas municipal water district is suing Selleck for more than $21,000 to cover the cost of the investigation and other damages to be determined. The good news for Selleck is that the Ventura County sheriff`s department told NBC news, they`ve looked into the allegations and were unable to establish a crime was committed. All In reached out to Tom Selleck for comment, but did not hear back. California officials have been cracking down on water theft as the state enters its fourth year as an absolutely historic drought. And as conflicts over who gets to use the dwindling water supply get increasingly heated and high stakes. And that is why All In is heading west for a special series of shows, live from California, starting this Monday, taking an in-depth look at the state`s water wars. You do not want to miss it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAYES: What would you like to see happen to Mr. Cosby? P.J. MASTEN, COSBY ACCUSER: I would like to see his star taken off the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I would like to see his statues taken off Disney properties and I would like to see him held accountable for all the rapes that did he to all these women. (END VIDEO CLIP)  HAYES: All right, 30 minutes after we went off the air, after that interview aired, the Bill Cosby statue was indeed taken off the lot of Walt Disney World. And according to Deadline Hollywood, Cosby he`s been dropped by his agent CAA as the world`s of entertainment and pop culture are just starting to reckon with the possibility that this beloved celebrated comic was a serial predator. And the question now is whether there will be any legal ramifications following a judge`s release of a 10-year-old deposition in which Cosby admitted to getting seven prescriptions for Quaaludes during the 1970s for the purpose of using the drug on women with whom he wanted to have sex. Cosby has never been charged, has denied these allegations in prior statements and has declined to offer further comment in the past few days. But civil suits have been filed against Mr. Cosby, signed by some of his accusers. Joining me now, Joe Cammarata, the attorney for three women who are suing Bill Cosby, Tamara Green, Taris Serenice (ph) and Linda Traits (ph). Joe, what is the status of the civil lawsuit that you have filed on behalf of your clients? JOE CAMMARATA, ATTORNEY: We have, excuse me. Pardon my voice. We have filed a civil lawsuit for defamation. Mr. Cosby has filed a motion to dismiss that case, to have it thrown out of court. And we`re waiting for the court`s ruling on whether or not the case will continue. HAYES: What are the possible legal avenues to be pursued here? You`re seeing conversations about statutes of limitations. A prosecutor from Pennsylvania who had first looked into the case that sort of spawned this lawsuit talked to my colleague Ari Melber and talked about the possibility of reopening it. I mean, where do you think this goes legally? CAMMARATA: Well, certainly the women that have been called liars have, within the last year or so, have a viable claim within the period within which they can file a lawsuit for defamation. As for the assault claims that happened 30, 40 years ago, I think they would be hard pressed to assert a claim for sexual assault given this late date. HAYES: This is a key point. There has been, there have been very pointed responses from the Cosby camp in response to many of these saying that essentially these allegations are fabricated. You`re representing women who were essentially called liars. And your lawsuit is specifically about that response, it`s about the defamation that you say occurred. CAMMARATA: It absolutely is. The women came forward with their allegations against Mr. Cosby and they were met with statements by Mr. Cosby through his lawyers and press people branding them as liars. And so if the court allows our case to go forward, the issue will be who is telling the truth? Was it the women or was it Mr. Cosby. HAYES: So this is key. In establishing defamation, what you`re saying is what will be at issue before the court if the lawsuit were to proceed is actually the facts of the matter, the truth of the case about what happened to the women that you represent and what Bill Cosby did or did not do. CAMMARATA: Absolutely. Because you can`t determine whether or not they were telling the truth without determining whether or not what they say happened, happened. They say they were assaulted, abused by Mr. Cosby and Mr. Cosby says, ain`t so. I`m not that kind of guy. I didn`t do it. They`re liars. And so now you have one in stark contrast to the other. And we`re going to have a forum, a trial hopefully that will determine who is just telling the truth.  HAYES: Finally, one of your clients was mentioned, I believe, in the deposition that was uncovered, not by name. She was redacted. But how does she feel about that? CAMMARATA: Well, I can`t talk to you specifically about how my client feels, but I can tell you generally that down to the very last woman, they have a felt sense of vindication, a sense of joy that this deposition has come out. And shown that they were telling the truth. HAYES: All right, Joe Cammarata, thank you very much. That`s All In for this evening. The Rachel Maddow Show starts right now.THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Currently, such people are detained in the U.S. and allowed to request asylum.President Trump wants them to do so from Mexico, communicating via videoconference calls with U.S. immigration officials from facilities that Mexico would presumably be forced to build.“This would say if you want to make a claim for asylum or whatever we’ll hear your case but you are going to wait in Mexico,” a DHS official said. “Those are details that are being worked out both within the department and between the US government and the government of Mexico … there are elements that still need to be worked out in detail.Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will travel to Mexico later this week to meet with representatives of the Mexican government. It remains unclear if they will discuss this issue.The new authority for immigration agents is among the dramatic, some would say untenable, tactics the Trump administration is preparing to deploy as it upends President Obama’s policies on illegal immigration.A pair of memos signed by John Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, and publicly released on Tuesday outline the plans for what present and former government officials say will be a massive roundup of undocumented immigrants. Near final drafts of the memos had leaked over the weekend and had been first reported by McClatchy.Officials disclosed that two former Senate aides to Attorney General Jeff Sessions drafted the plan without input from career DHS policy staffers. The ideas aren’t new. Many of the approaches described in the memos come from a 1996 law that policy makers and law enforcement agents had disregarded as either unenforceable or absurd.“Most of these provisions of law have been there for decades,” the DHS official said. “We are simply trying to execute what Congress has asked us to do.”Among them was the Mexico part of the plan, for example, which calls for returning undocumented immigrants “to the foreign contiguous territory from which they arrived.” The memo goes on to point out how foisting the immigrants onto Mexico would benefit DHS’s budget, saying that it would, “save the Department’s detention and adjudication resources for other priority aliens.”However, former senior Mexican and American immigration officials said it could very well create new security problems along the border, as authorities in each country push unwanted migrants back and forth.The American Immigration Lawyers Association said that the proposal would violate U.S. law and international treaty obligations. Mexico is as likely to embrace the plan as it did the notion of paying for a wall. “I would expect Mexico to respond with an emphatic ‘No,’” said Gustavo Mohar, a former senior Mexican immigration and national security policy official.Whether viable or not, the Trump administration’s deportation plans mark a dramatic departure from decades of policy and practice. Current and former immigration policy officials say that while the details of how the administration intends to carry out the plans remain unclear — if not insurmountable — the administration’s overall message to enforcement agents across the country is clear: the limits have been lifted.President Obama attempted to focus enforcement efforts on immigrants who had been convicted of serious crimes, and on those who were caught while or shortly after illegally entering the country. Still, his administration deported record numbers of immigrants, most of whom had only been accused of minor crimes and immigration violations.The Trump administration says it, too, is focused on deporting criminals, but it has redefined crimes to include any activity that might bring a conviction, including entering the U.S. without permission. Effectively, that makes virtually everyone in the U.S. without a proper visa subject to roundup at their workplace or home.“If you are present in the U.S. without being admitted or paroled or having overstayed your visa, the immigration laws of the U.S. subject you to removal,” the DHS official said. “Everyone who is in violation of the laws is theoretically subject to enforcement. The Department has limited resources and we will, to the extent that we can, focus on folks who have committed serious crimes.”The only clear exception, according to the enforcement plan and the DHS briefing, is for immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers.“Anyone who complained about Obama as the deporter-in-chief,” said David Martin, formerly DHS’s principal deputy general counsel, “is unfortunately going to get a taste of what it’s like when someone is really gung-ho.”Greg Chen, the policy director at AILA, said the Trump plan would “effectively unleash a massive deportation force with extremely broad authority to use detention as the default mechanism for anyone suspected of violating immigration law.”The question looming over the proposals is how many of them, with all their legal and logistical obstacles, will the president actually be able to carry out.The memos, for example, authorize the Border Patrol to hire 5,000 new agents, even though the force has never been able to fill the slots it has already been allotted. Some 60 percent of applicants to the Border Patrol fail the required polygraph, and those who pass take 18 months to get sent out into the field.The Trump plan calls for the expansion of a George W. Bush-era program, known as 287g, which allows DHS to deputize state and local police as immigration agents. It was touted after 9/11 as a critical “force-multiplier.” But by 2010, some of the country’s largest police departments were refusing to participate because they believed it would shatter the trust between their officers and the communities they were sworn to protect. Meanwhile, participating agencies, which foot the bill for the program, were suddenly saddled with new debts and hounded by accusations of racial profiling and other abuse, forcing the Obama administration to suspend expansion of the program.Until now, the enforcement of summary deportation laws, known as “expedited removal,” have been limited to those apprehended within 14 days of illegally entering the country and within 100 miles of Canada or Mexico. The memos signed by Kelly would allow use of those laws anywhere in the country against anyone who entered illegally within the past two years.Lucas Guttentag, a former DHS adviser and Stanford law professor, said this would “unleash chaos,” violate due process, and meet challenges in court, similar to those that scuttled the administration’s travel ban.There would also be aggressive challenges, lawyers said, to plans that would allow immigration agents to deport unaccompanied minor children who crossed the border illegally, rather than uniting them with parents or other relatives in the U.S.The reason for discussing unaccompanied minors is “ that they have been abandoned by their parents or legal guardians,” the DHS official said. If it is “determined that there is a parent or guardian in the U.S. that they can be handed over to, then DHS needs to take a hard look over whether that person is actually’’ an unaccompanied minor.“There will be a renewed focus on ensuring that folks don’t abuse the system,” the DHS official added.They also expect legal opposition to a proposal that would strip undocumented immigrants of existing privacy protections, allowing personal information such as asylum cases or immigration violations to be publicly disclosed.“We want to ensure that our privacy policies are consistent with the law,” the DHS official said. “The Privacy Act applies by statute to citizens’’ and green card holders. “The President has asked us to align our laws with what congress has directed.”“The Trump people have clearly bought into the model of harsh enforcement. They apparently think, ‘we’ll be tough, and a lot of people will leave on their own,’” said Martin, an immigration law professor at the University of Virginia. “They believe they’ll win in the court of public opinion. I’m not sure about that. A lot of Americans know hard-working undocumented immigrants. The kind of enforcement Trump’s people are talking about will visibly create many more sympathetic cases than unsympathetic ones.”Some of the provisions explicitly acknowledge that it could take years before DHS has the manpower and money to pull off what the president has ordered. Immigration enforcement agents, however, have already begun filling the policy void by launching raids and deportations, including some that advocates worry are meant to test the limits. Meanwhile panic has taken hold in many immigrant communities.“The level of fear is more than anything we’ve ever seen,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She said the plan’s sweep, “sent a chill to my bones,” because it threatens to do irreparable harm to millions of families. She added, “This all seems aimed at changing who we are as a nation.”",https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-plan-deport-anyone-crossing-mexican-border-regardless-of-nationality,
The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,NAFTA’s Economic Impact,"The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, is a three-country accord negotiated by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States that entered into force in January 1994. NAFTA’s terms, which were implemented gradually through January 2008, provided for the elimination of most tariffs on products traded among the three countries. Liberalization of trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing was a major focus. The deal also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute-resolution mechanisms, and, through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards.NAFTA fundamentally reshaped North American economic relations, driving an unprecedented integration between Canada and the United States’ developed economies and Mexico, a developing country. NAFTA enjoyed bipartisan backing—it was negotiated by Republican President George H.W. Bush and passed through Congress and implemented under Democratic President Bill Clinton. It encouraged a more than tripling of regional trade and cross-border investment between the three countries also grew significantly. Yet NAFTA has remained a perennial target in the broader debate over free trade. President Donald J. Trump says the deal has shifted U.S. manufacturing production, and jobs, to Mexico, and in August 2017 his administration reopened negotiations with Canada and Mexico with the aim of reforming it.When negotiations for NAFTA began in 1991, the goal for all three countries was the integration of Mexico with the highly developed, high-wage economies of the United States and Canada. The hope was that freer trade would bring stronger and steadier economic growth to Mexico, providing new jobs and opportunities for its growing workforce and discouraging illegal migration from Mexico. For the United States and Canada, Mexico was seen both as a promising new market for exports and as a lower cost investment location that could enhance the competitiveness of U.S. and Canadian companies.While the United States had completed a free trade agreement with Canada in 1988, the addition of Mexico was unprecedented. Opponents of NAFTA seized on the wage differentials with Mexico, which had a per capita income just 30 percent [PDF] that of the United States. U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot argued in 1992 that trade liberalization would lead to a “giant sucking sound” of U.S. jobs fleeing across the border. Supporters like Presidents Bush and Clinton countered that the agreement would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs a year, while Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortiari saw it as an opportunity to modernize the Mexican economy so that it would “export goods, not people.”NAFTA also ushered in a new era of regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs), which have proliferated as the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) global trade talks have stagnated. The United States now has FTAs with twenty countries, and is pushing for major new regional deals with Asia and Europe. NAFTA also pioneered the incorporation of labor and environmental provisions in U.S. trade agreements, provisions which have become progressively more comprehensive [PDF] in subsequent FTAs.Economists largely agree that NAFTA has provided benefits to the North American economies. Regional trade increased sharply [PDF] over the treaty’s first two decades, from roughly $290 billion in 1993 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2016. Cross-border investment has also surged, with U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in Mexico increasing in that period from $15 billion to more than $100 billion. But experts also say that it has proven difficult to tease out the deal’s direct effects from other factors, including rapid technological change, expanded trade with other countries such as China, and unrelated domestic developments in each of the countries. Debate persists regarding NAFTA’s legacy on employment and wages, with some workers and industries facing painful disruptions as they lose market share due to increased competition, and others gaining from the new market opportunities that were created.In the years since NAFTA, U.S. trade with its North American neighbors has more than tripled, growing more rapidly than U.S. trade with the rest of the world. Canada and Mexico are the two largest destinations for U.S. exports, accounting for more than a third of the total. Most estimates conclude that the deal had a modest but positive impact on U.S. GDP of less than 0.5 percent, or a total addition of up to $80 billion dollars to the U.S. economy upon full implementation, or several billion dollars of added growth per year.Such upsides of trade often escape notice, because while the costs are highly concentrated in specific industries like auto manufacturing, the benefits of a deal like NAFTA are distributed widely across society. Supporters of NAFTA estimate that some fourteen million jobs rely on trade with Canada and Mexico, while the nearly two hundred thousand export-related jobs created annually by the pact pay 15 to 20 percent more on average than the jobs that were lost.Critics of the deal, however, argue that it is to blame for job losses and wage stagnation in the United States, driven by low-wage competition, companies moving production to Mexico to lower costs, and a widening trade deficit. The U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. Economists like the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s (CEPR) Dean Baker and the Economic Policy Institute argue that this surge of imports caused the loss of up to 600,000 U.S. jobs over two decades, though they admit that some of this import growth would likely have happened even without NAFTA.Many workers and labor leaders point to these numbers to blame trade, including NAFTA, for the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. The U.S. auto sector lost some 350,000 jobs since 1994—a third of the industry—while Mexican auto sector employment spiked from 120,000 to 550,000 workers. CEPR’s Baker argues that econometric research shows that increased trade also puts downward pressure on wages for non-college educated workers, who are more likely to face direct competition from low-wage workers in Mexico.But other economists like Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) emphasize that increased trade produces gains for the overall U.S. economy. Some jobs are lost due to imports, but others are created, and consumers benefit significantly from the falling prices and often improved quality of goods created by import competition. A 2014 PIIE study of NAFTA’s effects found that about 15,000 jobs on net are lost each year due to the pact—but that for each of those jobs lost, the economy gains roughly $450,000 in the form of higher productivity and lower consumer prices.Many economists also assert that the recent troubles of U.S. manufacturing have little to do with NAFTA, arguing that manufacturing in the United States was under stress decades before the treaty. Research by David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson published in January 2016 found [PDF] that competition with China had a much bigger negative impact on U.S. jobs since 2001, when China joined the WTO. Hanson, an economist and trade expert at the University of California, San Diego, says that the steepest decline in manufacturing jobs, which fell from seventeen million to eleven million between 2000 and 2010, is mostly attributable to trade with China and underlying technological changes. “China is at the top of the list in terms of the employment impacts that we found since 2000, with technology second, and NAFTA far less important,” he says. A roundup of global news developments by CFR.org editors, including analysis from CFR scholars. In fact, says Hanson, NAFTA helped the U.S. auto sector compete with China. By contributing to the development of cross-border supply chains, NAFTA lowered costs, increased productivity, and improved U.S. competitiveness. This meant shedding some jobs in the United States as positions moved to Mexico, he argues, but without the pact, even more would have otherwise been lost. “Because Mexico is so close, you can have a regional industry cluster where goods can go back and forth. The manufacturing industries in the three countries can be very integrated,” he says. These sort of linkages, which have given U.S. automakers an advantage in relation to China, would be much more difficult without NAFTA’s tariff reductions and protections for intellectual property. Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says anxiety over trade deals has grown because wages haven’t kept pace with labor productivity while income inequality has risen. To some extent, he says, trade deals have hastened the pace of these changes in that they have “reinforced the globalization of the American economy.”NAFTA gave a major boost to Mexican farm exports to the United States, which have tripled since NAFTA’s implementation. Hundreds of thousands of auto manufacturing jobs have also been created in the country, and most studies have found [PDF] that the pact had a positive impact on Mexican productivity and consumer prices.The pact was the continuation of a decade of economic liberalization that saw the country transition from one of the world’s most protectionist economies to one of the most open to trade. Mexico had reduced many of its trade barriers upon joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the WTO, in 1986, but still had a pre-NAFTA average tariff level [PDF] of 10 percent.Mexican policymakers saw NAFTA as an opportunity to both accelerate and “lock in” these hard won reforms to the Mexican economy. In addition to liberalizing trade, Mexico’s leaders reduced public debt, introduced a balanced budget rule, stabilized inflation, and built up the country’s foreign reserves. Thus while Mexico was hard hit [PDF] by the 2008 U.S. recession due to its dependence on exports to the U.S. market—in 2009 Mexican exports to the United States fell 17 percent while its economy contracted by over 6 percent—its economy was able to bounce back relatively quickly. Mexico returned to growth in 2010, its GDP expanding over 5 percent, and subsequently falling to around 2 percent in 2014 and 2015.But Mexico’s NAFTA experience has suffered from a disconnect between the promises of some of its supporters—that the pact would deliver rapid growth, raise wages, and reduce emigration—and the deal’s more mixed outcomes. Between 1993 and 2013, Mexico’s economy grew at an average rate of just 1.3 percent a year during a period when Latin America was undergoing a major expansion. Poverty remains at the same levels as in 1994. And the expected “wage convergence” between U.S. and Mexican wages didn’t happen, with Mexico’s per capita income rising at an annual average of just 1.2 percent in that period—far slower than Latin American countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru.Mexican unemployment also rose, which some economists have blamed on NAFTA for exposing Mexican farmers, especially corn producers, to competition from heavily subsidized U.S. agriculture. A study led by CEPR economist Mark Weisbrot estimates that NAFTA put almost two million small-scale Mexican farmers [PDF] out of work, in turn driving illegal migration to the United States. (Migration to the United States, both legal and illegal, more than doubled after 1994, peaking in 2007. However, the flow reversed after 2008 as more Mexican-born immigrants began leaving the country than arriving. Experts attribute this to stricter border enforcement, changing demographics in Mexico, and the combination of fewer available jobs in the United States along with more in Mexico.)Many analysts explain these divergent outcomes by pointing to the “two-speed” nature of Mexico’s economy, in which NAFTA drove the growth of foreign investment, high-tech manufacturing, and rising wages in the industrial north, while the largely agrarian south remains detached from this new economy. As University of Pennsylvania economist Mauro Guillen argues, Mexico’s rising inequality stems from NAFTA-oriented workers in the north gaining much higher wages from trade-related activity.Ultimately, many experts caution, Mexico’s recent economic performance has been affected by many non-NAFTA factors. The 1994 devaluation of the peso drove Mexican exports, while competition with China’s low-cost manufacturing sector [PDF] likely depressed growth. Unrelated public policies, such as land reform, made it easier for farmers to sell their land and emigrate. As UCSD’s Hanson has argued [PDF], Mexico’s struggles have largely domestic causes: poorly developed credit markets, a large and low-productivity informal sector, and dysfunctional regulation.Canada has seen strong gains in cross-border investment in the NAFTA era: Since 1993, U.S. and Mexican investments in Canada have tripled. U.S. investment, which accounts for more than half of Canada’s FDI stock, grew from [PDF] $70 billion in 1993 to over $368 billion in 2013.However, the most consequential aspect for Canada—opening its economy to the U.S. market, by far Canada’s largest trading partner—predated NAFTA, with the 1989 entry into force of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA). Overall Canada-U.S. trade increased rapidly in the wake of Canada’s trade liberalization. Post-NAFTA, Canadian exports to the United States grew [PDF] from $110 billion to $346 billion, while imports from the United States grew by almost the same amount.Agriculture, in particular, saw a boost. Canada is the leading importer of U.S. agricultural products, and one of NAFTA’s biggest economic effects for Canada has been to increase bilateral U.S.-Canada agricultural flows. Canadian agricultural trade with the United States more than tripled since 1994, as did Canada’s total agriculture exports to NAFTA partners.Neither the worst fears of Canada’s trade opponents—that opening to trade would gut the country’s manufacturing sector—nor its highest hopes—that it would spark a rapid increase in productivity—came to pass. Canadian manufacturing employment held steady, but the “productivity gap” between the Canadian and U.S. economies wasn’t closed: Canada’s labor productivity remains at 72 percent [PDF] of U.S. levels.The deal has remained a political target. In 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama responded to widespread trade skepticism in the Democratic base by promising to renegotiate NAFTA to include tougher labor and environmental standards, an idea subsequently postponed to future trade agreements. The issue resurfaced in the 2016 presidential campaign, with both Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) and Donald Trump criticizing the pact for job losses.In May 2017, President Trump made good on his campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA, officially informing Congress that talks would be reopened with Canada and Mexico. The three countries kicked off formal negotiations in August 2017, stating that they hope to conclude them by early 2018, before Mexican presidential elections in July of that year. While details of the talks are classified, the Trump administration has said it will focus on reducing the U.S.-Mexico trade deficit, tightening rules-of-origin requirements, reforming the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism, and updating the pact to include digital services and intellectual property. Even as negotiations proceed, Trump has reiterated his threat to withdraw the United States altogether.Among policy experts, much of the debate has centered on how to mitigate the negative effects of deals like NAFTA, whether by compensating workers who lose their jobs or providing worker retraining programs to help them transition to new industries.In particular, expanding the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which helps workers pay for education or training to find new jobs, could help quell anger directed at trade liberalization. Introduced in the 1960s, TAA was cut sharply in the 1980s, and many economists argue that its current funding levels are far from sufficient to address the increase in trade-related job losses. “There are pockets that have felt lots of pain,” says UCSD’s Hanson. “The existence of those pockets highlights our policy failures in helping regions and individuals adjust to the impact of globalization.”Another policy pressed by some economists, as well as by President Obama, is expanded wage insurance, which would guarantee laid-off workers a portion of their previous salaries for a set period, usually several years. Such insurance would be especially relevant for many older workers who may struggle to find work in new industries without taking a steep pay cut.Many experts have argued for deeper North American integration, especially in areas such as energy, border security, and immigration reform. To that end, President Obama had pushed the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with eleven other countries, including Canada and Mexico. That deal was signed in February 2016. But with President Trump rejecting the TPP in addition to reopening NAFTA, the new administration is set to upend decades of bipartisan consensus on the desirability of expanding the United States’ multilateral trade relationships.",https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/naftas-economic-impact,

It’s a time to celebrate Mexican culture and, for some, an opportunity to drink a lot of margaritas and cerveza.But it is also a frequently misunderstood holiday. For those out of the loop, here’s a refresher on what Cinco de Mayo is all about.What exactly is Cinco de Mayo?People often mistake Cinco de Mayo for a celebration of Mexican independence. But they’re wrong.The holiday celebrates a failed French invasion after a fledgling Mexican state defaulted on debt payments to European governments.In 1861 Mexico was suffering from financial ruin following years of internal strife. This was exploited by the French President Napoleon III, who thought it would be a fantastic time to try and build an empire there. Mexico had defaulted on debts with Britain and Spain as well, but those two countries negotiated with the country and withdrew their navy.The French invaded Mexico in late 1861 with well-armed forces and stormed Veracruz, forcing the Mexican government and its forces to retreat into northern Mexico.Confident of further victories, French forces focused their attention on the city Puebla de Los Angeles. Anticipating the attack, Mexican President Benito Juárez brought together a group of 2,000 men to fight back, many of whom were indigenous Mexicans or of mixed ancestry.When the French finally attacked, on May 5, 1862, the battle lasted from daybreak to early evening. The French ended up retreating after losing almost 500 soldiers. The Mexicans lost fewer than 100.Strategically, not really. The battle represented more of a symbolic victory for the Mexican forces and added to the resistance. French forces didn’t leave until 1867 after years of fighting. Mexicans were helped in part by the end of the Civil War, when the US was able to send their own troops to help out their besieged neighbour.So all of Mexico celebrates Cinco de Mayo, right?Nope. People in Puebla celebrate, as that's where the unlikely victory occurred, but the festivities aren't nationwide. Cinco de Mayo isn’t a federal holiday so the day is just like any other day for most people in Mexico.When does Mexico celebrate its independence?Mexico celebrates its independence on September 16. On that day in 1810, Mexican revolutionary priest Miguel Hidalgo y Castilla made a famous call to arms for his fellow men and women to resist Spanish colonial government.Why is it celebrated in the United States?The holiday is widely seen as a celebration of Mexican cultural heritage for America's growing Hispanic population.Latino activists raised awareness for the holiday in the 1960s. In large part, those early holidays in the US were a forum to celebrate the fact that a group of ragtag indigenous people were able to successfully hold back French forces. The holiday has really taken off in the US since then and people today celebrate with parades, parties, mariachi music, and traditional Mexican foods.Is Cinco de Mayo particularly significant this year?Donald Trump’s election has bred some uncertainty and fear amongst some people of Mexican heritage in the United States. Mr Trump has favoured anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, including a promise to deport all undocumented immigrants in the country and build a wall on the border with Mexico to keep people out.Last year Mr Trump tweeted out a photo of him eating a taco bowl (which is not a traditional Mexican dish) on Cinco de Mayo with the statement “I love Hispanics”. But Mexican-Americans aren’t necessarily encouraged by that tweet or the president’s actual positions since, and some have said they are fearful of celebrating Cinco de Mayo this year because Mr Trump has stepped up immigration enforcement since taking office.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cinco-de-mayo-2017-mexico-what-is-it-when-what-happens-how-to-celebrate-a7720331.html,
The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country.,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,What If Mexico Really Does Pay for Trump’s Wall?,"Updated on April 5 at 9:15 a.m. ET Maybe it’s because Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexican border has more than doubled in height over the course of his presidential campaign, theoretically soaring past the Berlin Wall and Great Wall of China. Maybe it’s because Mexico’s former president said he wouldn’t pay for “that fucking wall.” Maybe it’s because the idea has been reduced to a call-and-response mantra at rallies. Whatever the explanation, Trump’s critics tend to dismiss his pledge to make Mexico “pay for the wall” as a cheap, chauvinist applause line at best and a dangerous deception at worst—an attempt to foist an impossible dream on an impossible benefactor. “The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that will run the whole border, that he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for,” Hillary Clinton mused in March. “You know, it is just fantasy.”Trump’s logic begins in a similar place as Obama’s, but then marches off in a different direction. He argues that American indispensability is a rotten deal that has turned a once-respected economic powerhouse into a “poor” nation burdened by $19 trillion in debt, lacking real friends but flush with freeloaders. He wants the U.S. to be a self-interested superpower, conducting diplomacy primarily through protectionist trade policies. And to “make America great again,” he’s willing to rethink and upend the key components of indispensability: America’s intricate alliances, overseas military bases, and mutual defense pacts, plus the pillars of the post-World War II international system—NATO, the UN, free trade, the global nuclear nonproliferation regime—that the United States helped design. “I’m not isolationist, but I am ‘America First,’” Trump told The New York Times, using a term for his foreign-policy doctrine that David Sanger of the Times had suggested. “We have been disrespected, mocked, and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher.” It’s a theme Trump has trumpeted for decades. “Make Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others pay for the protection we extend as allies,” he wrote in 1987. “Let’s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.” Which brings us back to the wall. How do you get “others” to pay? The answer, when it comes to Mexico, offers a case study in what Trump’s America-First theory might look like in practice.Constructing Trump’s wall along America’s 2,000-mile southern border would likely constitute the largest infrastructure project in the United States since Dwight Eisenhower’s highway system. Trump says the wall will cost no more than $12 billion, but some experts estimate that it could require an investment of $25 billion or more, not including hefty maintenance costs. Others claim that given the expense, along with myriad engineering, environmental, and legal obstacles, the wall simply can’t be built. That Mexican officials are vehemently denying they’ll pay for the wall isn’t all that surprising—why would they shell out billions for something they don’t want? But how would Trump get Mexico to do it anyway? In his immigration-reform plan, the candidate lists several ways to force the Mexican government to pay up: [T]he United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards—of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options]. On the campaign trail, Trump and his surrogates have elaborated on these proposals. Trump has said he will essentially use America’s $58-billion trade deficit with Mexico as a treasure chest. But he’s given little detail about how he’d do this—just because Americans purchased $58 billion more in goods and services from Mexico than Mexicans bought from the U.S. doesn’t mean the Mexican government itself has those funds lying around to give back to the United States. Shannon O’Neil, a Latin America expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me that while the Mexican government’s finances are fairly healthy relative to those in other emerging markets, the government recently responded to global economic uncertainty and low oil prices by reducing its 2016 budget by $7 billion, cutting long-term investments in infrastructure projects like roads and bridges (or, say, walls). The 2017 budget may be pared down by $10 billion more.Then there are remittances—in this case money that Mexicans in the U.S. send back to their families in Mexico. “We have the ability to shut down the flow of remittances to Mexico from illegal aliens working in the United States,” Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Trump supporter, said in February. “Mexico will then have to make a choice: Either make a single payment ... to the United States to pay for the wall, or lose most of the $23 billion in remittances that Mexico receives every year from its nationals working illegally in the United States.” In a pair of posts for National Review, Jim Geraghty clarifies that this $23 billion is sent by Mexicans with and without legal documents, which makes impounding all remittances problematic. The U.S. Treasury Department could implement regulations that punish banks for processing remittances, borrowing a tactic previously deployed against terrorist financing. There might also be legal precedent for seizing wire transfers made by undocumented immigrants. But such moves, Geraghty writes, “would enrage the banks and financial institutions that make money off the transfers,” and might encourage Mexican immigrants to bypass the formal financial system and instead smuggle cash or rely on hawala- or Bitcoin-like networks. Taxing remittance payments might be a simpler way of curtailing the flow of money to Mexico, he reasons. Trump, in a memo to The Washington Post released this week, stated that blocking remittances would be his preferred method of compelling Mexico to pay for the wall. As president, he would propose refashioning counterterrorism regulations to require that money-transfer companies like Western Union ask immigrants to present their legal documents before wiring money outside the United States. Mexican officials will immediately protest, Trump predicts, but they’ll probably capitulate and “make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion” to prevent the regulation from going into effect. Remittances serve “as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico,” Trump explains. “There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico.” In short: The Mexican government will have to choose between forsaking its poorest citizens or building Trump’s wall. It will be “an easy decision for Mexico,” Trump claims.Even if all these machinations caused Mexico to cough up cash, the U.S. Congress would need to appropriate the money to build the wall. “It is likely that the vote for funding construction of a border wall would be the biggest, most consequential, and hardest-fought since the passage of Obamacare,” Geraghty writes. “[U]ntil all of these obstacles were overcome—until funding was procured from Mexico, the Congress gave its approval, and the courts signed off—construction of the wall couldn’t even begin. Structural engineers argue that, pulling out all the stops, the wall could be completed in four years. Trump’s signature promise likely couldn’t be fulfilled until mid-way through his second term at the earliest.” The Mexican government will have to choose between forsaking its poorest citizens or building the wall. It will be “an easy decision,” Trump claims. O’Neil told me that hiking visa and border-crossing fees for Mexicans seemed like “the only way you could really potentially [finance the wall] and have [the U.S.] remain compliant with treaties that we’ve signed and other agreements.” The revenue that a President Trump raised from this scheme “could go to promoting security on the border, which could be a wall.” In this scenario, Mexicans, not the Mexican government, would be helping pay for the wall, if indirectly. But imposing those fees would have consequences. Mexico is the top destination in the world for American tourists, drawing around 26 million visitors per year from the United States, or more than four times the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants currently living in the U.S. Trump could raise the costs for Mexicans visiting the U.S., O’Neil said, but in response “you should expect the Mexicans to raise the costs for Americans going there.”Trump, of course, could merely be staking out an extreme position at the outset of negotiations with Mexico—a common deal-making tactic known as “anchoring.” But, as Aaron Wallen, a lecturer at Columbia Business School, recently told Slate, Trump’s inflexible stance on how the wall will be financed, and the Mexican government’s rigid refusal to foot the bill, appear to have left nothing in the way of what negotiators call a “zone of possible agreement,” or ZOPA. In instances such as these, additional issues are usually folded into the talks. Mexico, for example, might agree to subsidize the wall in return for a new trade deal with the U.S. that is favorable to Mexican interests. Trump would be able to say he’d made good on a key campaign pledge, but he’d pay a pretty penny for the privilege. It’s difficult to imagine Trump striking such a bargain. But something along these lines actually happened in 1954, the last time the U.S. asked Mexico to pay for an unwelcome immigration measure. As Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute has recounted, U.S.-Mexican negotiations over renewing the Bracero guest-worker program had stalled that year, in part over the Mexican government’s resistance to patrolling its side of the border to halt illegal immigration. So the U.S. government issued a shock announcement: Migrants who crossed the border into the United States would be swiftly granted a job and labor contract. Mexico deployed soldiers to patrol the border after all—in an effort to prevent a mass outflow of human capital from the country—and the Bracero program was quickly restored. (Later that year, Eisenhower conducted mass deportations of undocumented Mexican immigrants—an operation Trump has praised.)“If a future President Trump negotiated a large scale guest worker visa program that allowed many temporary Mexican guest workers in annually and legalized most of the unauthorized immigrants in the United States, he could gain the diplomatic leverage to prompt Mexico to build a wall—or at least deploy some troops in a fancy show,” even if the guest-worker program renders Trump’s wall irrelevant, Nowrasteh concluded. Crucially, Trump has also floated the idea of Mexico paying for the wall not with a government check, but through a “tax,” presumably in the form of new U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico. This is what Trump appears to have in mind when he muses about “playing with” the U.S.-Mexican trade deficit, and such action would violate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which created a largely tariff-free trade zone across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. It’s hard to predict what would happen next, but Moody’s Analytics has tried. In an economic model produced for The Washington Post, Moody’s assumed that Trump honored his campaign promises, imposing a 35-percent tariff on imports from Mexico and a 45-percent tariff on imports from China. The model found that if both those countries retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports, unleashing a trade war, all three countries could fall into recession. American consumers would face higher-priced Mexican and Chinese goods. U.S. companies that sell goods and services to Mexico and China, or are otherwise integrated with the Mexican and Chinese economies, might be forced to lay off workers. The tumult could cause stock markets to plummet and economic growth in Europe to contract. Millions of American jobs could be lost, at least in the short term, while the country’s manufacturing sector scales up to meet the demand for lost imports.Any of these measures—the remittance regulations, the visa fees, the trade wars—would deal a severe blow to the U.S.-Mexican alliance. The fulfillment of Trump’s related campaign pledges—the renegotiation of NAFTA, the deportation of unauthorized immigrants en masse—would only harden the blow. Coordination between the U.S. and Mexico on intelligence and law-enforcement activities at the border would suffer. America’s commercial ties with its second-largest export market and third-largest trading partner would fray. A nationalist backlash to Trump’s policies would likely emerge in Mexico, just as anti-Americanism in the region is declining with the restoration of U.S.-Cuban relations and the election of a Washington-friendly president in Argentina. “The Mexican government and the Mexican people are totally against the idea of walling off the border,” Andrés Rozental, a former Mexican ambassador and deputy foreign minister, told me. “The first thing that the Mexican government has behind its position is that partners such as the U.S. and Mexico, in the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as two countries that are geographically contiguous, should not and do not need walls to separate them at the border. What we need is a better implementation of existing rules and regulations.” When I asked Rozental about the feasibility of Mexico paying for Trump’s wall, he challenged my hypothetical: “From my perspective, Trump’s nonsense is just that—it’s bravado, it’s rhetoric, it’s playing on fears of people in the U.S. particularly who have lost jobs or who feel that in one way or another the U.S.’s problems are the fault of everyone other than the United States, beginning with Mexico but it includes obviously China, and it includes Japan. He has hit on almost everything that the U.S. has abroad in terms of its agreements, in terms of its relationships. I just don’t think this is a realistic possibility.”Rozental may well be right. Trump’s immigration plan may be thoroughly insincere or cynical. His America-First doctrine may reflect a profound misunderstanding or ignorance of foreign policy and the U.S.-led international order, not some grand strategy informed by close study of America’s place in the world. He may be fully aware that he’s building walls in the air with play pesos. On the other hand, Trump may actually mean what he says. Critics like Hillary Clinton may interpret his wall proposal as fantasy because Trump’s underlying idea is so big—because he’s advocating for an alternate reality in which the United States puts up walls, sheds alliances, and spurns free trade, and dispenses with 70 years of accumulated, largely bipartisan wisdom about how America should conduct itself abroad.    If Trump is putting forth a big idea, it seems rooted in disillusionment with the burdens of being the world’s sole superpower. “I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they’re blown up,” he recently told The Washington Post. “We build another one, we get blown up. We rebuild it three times and yet we can’t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education because we can’t build in our own country. At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ So, I know the outer world exists and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.” Hillary Clinton may interpret Trump’s wall proposal as fantasy because his underlying idea is so big. For segments of the U.S. electorate who have seen few tangible gains from the U.S.-led international order, Trump’s message resonates. Consider free trade, for instance. Twenty years on, NAFTA’s record is mixed. The agreement appears to have had a positive, if modest, impact on GDP growth and trade volume in North America. But in the process, hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost manufacturing jobs to lower-wage workers in Mexico. As Binyamin Appelbaum notes in The New York Times, when the U.S. company Carrier shifts the manufacturing of its air conditioners to Mexico, that makes air conditioners cheaper for all Americans. But it also leaves several hundred Americans out of work. And the U.S. government hasn’t done enough to help those Americans recover, develop new skills, and find employment.These are real problems. But is Trump demolishing the house to fix a leaking pipe? Are the benefits of building a wall, and making Mexico pay for it, really worth the costs of antagonizing America’s southern neighbor and risking recession? And why incur these costs at a time when more Mexicans are leaving the United States than coming into the country, and a significant number of those who are arriving are entering the U.S. legally and then overstaying their visas—a problem Trump’s wall can’t solve? Then there are the second-order consequences of applying pay-for-the-wallism to America’s dealings with the rest of the world. Earlier this year in Politico, Thomas Wright imagined some of the other fallout from Trump’s foreign policy: After his election, other countries will immediately hedge against the risk of abandonment. There will be massive uncertainty around America’s commitments. Would Trump defend the Baltics? Would he defend the Senkaku Islands [in the East China Sea]? Or Saudi Arabia? Some nations will give in to China, Russia and Iran. Others, like Japan, will push back, perhaps by acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump may well see such uncertainty as a positive. Putting everything in play would give him great leverage. But by undoing the work of Truman and his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, it would be the end of the American era. There are plenty of legitimate criticisms of the American era, but, among other things, it has so far produced no world war or nuclear war, and it has left the United States at the helm of a relatively stable international system that is generally favorable to U.S. economic and geopolitical interests. And yet, these benefits aren’t enough for Trump, or at least they’re not worth the cost. In his interview with The New York Times, the candidate said something very revealing. Asked when America was last great, he bypassed the Reagan era, criticizing Ronald Reagan’s trade policies and particularly his support for NAFTA, and instead cited the turn of the 20th century through the 1940s—a period when the country was just becoming a world power and only beginning to remake the international system in its image. Some might say the U.S.-led order that subsequently emerged is the source of American greatness. But clearly not according to Donald Trump’s definition of greatness.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/trump-wall-mexico-foreign-policy/475581/,

According to The Guardian , this logo captures the company's success at controlling and dominating what Mexicans watch. In a country where newspaper readership is tiny and the reach of the Internet and cable is still largely limited to the middle classes, Televisa -- and its rival TV Azteca -- exert a powerful influence over national politics. Through its scores of stations and repeater towers, the former accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's free-to-air television; most of the rest belong to Azteca.Accused for decades of politically slanted news coverage, Televisa represents another rarely spoken fact: modern Mexico has never functioned without corruption, and its current system would either collapse or change beyond recognition if it tried to do so. Just before the 2012 elections, Mexican news magazine Proceso and The Guardian of a series of shady deals struck between Televisa and the nation's powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (the PRI). In return for multimillion dollar payouts, the network provided the PRI's candidate a special public awareness campaign that gave him glowing coverage on its flagship news and entertainment shows; hushed criticism on the network's talk shows; and subliminal promotion to strengthen his overall image. In its typically artful way, the PRI had managed to secure a lock on the nation's airwaves. Although the exposé provoked widespread student protests for weeks leading up to the election, it barely made a blip in the results. The PRI's candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, won by a landslide. In the aftermath, Peña Nieto immediately clinched a deal -- again, in typical PRI fashion -- called Pact for Mexico, a set of 95 vague proposals that gathered together powerful actors from every political party under one broad tent. In the early 1960s a psychologist named Douglas McGregor observed . Theory X assumes that most people are naturally indolent and seek to get away with something for which they are not entitled. Theory Y assumes the reverse -- that most people are basically honest and hardworking and, if provided with reasonable expectations of satisfactory performance, strive to achieve it.It may come as no surprise that Mexican companies are overwhelmingly theory X organizations. Why this is true is deeply rooted in the nation's past. One telling sign is the way business came to rely on government; not just in terms of policy decisions (which affect business in every nation) but personal relations with government officials. Since the nation's founding, few private fortunes were made without (fang or cunning), the owner's ability to cultivate ties to the right officials and master the art of mutually convenient relationships. In this scheme, the mindset of politicians drove (and was driven by) the mindset of business leaders: wary, secretive, suspicious, and cynical. Each group deeply distrusted the other, yet both intermingled in the same tight-knit social and business circles. An entire foundation supported this symbiosis: classism, Catholicism, a gulf between pre-Hispanic and European values, strong authoritarian and elitist traditions, and, of course, corruption. On all sides, trust was minimal. Most transactions were made between family, friends and neighbors. In time, the sense of us versus them gave rise to deep-seated paranoia, subtle and often unspoken expectations to keep outsiders outside -- the knowing wink, the sealed lips. Across the Atlantic, this same deep mutual distrust morphed into an entire way of life; what the Sicilians call -- a rigorous code of silence and non-interference in the illegal acts of others.Back in the 1920s, a famous Italian official named Cesari Mori was appointed prefect of Palermo, the capital of Sicily. Mori was a model police officer, later chosen by Mussolini to lead his national campaign against organized crime. For years, Mori lived in Trappini on the western part of the island. In his writings, he claimed to have penetrated the Sicilian mind which he found to be: Simple and kindly, apt to color everything with generosity of feeling, inclined to deceive itself, to hope and believe; ready to lay all its knowledge, affection and cooperation at the feet of a powerful figure who assumes their legitimate need for justice and redemption, according to . The key to the Mafia's success, he argued, was its ability to understand this complex dynamic and exploit it. And so in Mexico: the entrenched power of monopolists, party bosses, cardinals and mafias are reflections of something much deeper -- a perspective that arose from what Cosa Nostra calls the painful scars of... tyranny and oppression. Not just in terms of crime, as in legendary mafiosos who steal from the rich and give to the poor, but as way of life; a way of facing adversity and relying bravely on your own people. Just as in Sicily, these cultural norms required centuries to coalesce, punctuated by watershed moments when outsiders came to be viewed with deep suspicion. Imagine the Aztec natives' reaction when the Conquerors showed up off the coast of Vera Cruz.The PRI was founded in the late 1920's by a generation of leaders whose ranks were not only influenced by the Conquest and everything this implies, but also decimated by . In the midst of the Mexican Revolution, a multi-sided civil war with dangerously shifting power struggles, the PRI decided to bridge wildly divergent ideological and political gaps by putting everyone under one roof -- in effect fusing the party and the Mexican nation-state . To this end, any means became justified: Between 1929 to 1982, the PRI won every presidential election by margins of over 70 percent -- which were obtained usually by massive electoral fraud. The party also held an overwhelming majority in the Chamber of Deputies, every seat in the Senate, and every state governorship. During its long reign, the PRI learned not only how to buy votes but also how to corrupt the army, exploit the media, buy off criminals and absorb the opposition. Loyalty, discipline, discretion and silence -- already deeply rooted in society -- became essential to the political system's survival. Although the oil and glue that held the working parts together was based on what Westerners call corruption, many Mexicans (just like Sicilians) didn't always see it that way. To most of the nation's political leaders, corruption was an aberration of law, but not of society. According to Alan Riding, author of , the system that emerged in the twentieth century merely institutionalized what was already there: a ruling class with absolute authority that rewarded unquestioned loyalty with favors and patronage.Many old habits, , including conflict of interest, nepotism and influence-peddling, were not even considered wrong; and since power rather than law dominated society, honesty itself was seemingly negotiable. Call it what you will -- paternalism, savior-ism, patronage, protectionism -- many Mexicans came to depend upon the strength and reliability of monopolists. For ordinary business people who dealt with these companies -- Telmex, Cemex, Televisa, Modelo, Ocesa, Femsa, Pemex, et al. -- the imperatives of order, trust, and what the Sicilians called our thing (the knowing wink and sealed lips) made it possible. Monopolies and monopolists are a deeply-rooted part of Mexico : This truth is close to the hearts of Mexican officials (many of whom grew up in the PRI) involved in several major antitrust claims currently before the Federal Antitrust Commission. Has the PRI's historic embrace of monopoly -- and its see no evil approach to criminality -- really changed? As : The fear is that the PRI's fundamental instincts remain the same: to shun openness in favor of media manipulation, to conflate public and private interests and to shield corrupt union bosses. In truth, nobody really knows. Peña's decision to arrest the head of the teacher's union last February sent a powerful (and unexpected) message to anyone planning to block the government's proposed reforms. Maybe the PRI is serious this time about asymmetric regulation and rules that force dominant companies to divest. The PRI realizes as much as anyone that monopolies have become a heavy drag on the nation's economy; a recent OECD study makes this crystal clear. But maybe not. Many powerful interests are vehemently opposed to cutting off the head of a goose that has laid golden eggs for so long. According to one Mexican journalist: The PRI and PAN parties are largely responsible for preserving Mexican monopolies, as their owners are both associates and campaign backers. My own guess is that Peña will attempt to play each monopolist off the other. As the heat turns up, he will try to keep infighting at acceptable levels under the big tent. And when things boil over, he will use his colmillo and unfailing PRI finesse to the party's advantage. As long as Carlos Slim's interests remain counter to those of Televisa and TV Azteca, all the better. Ultimately, the PRI -- like any true monopolist -- wants to play it both ways. And if Peña succeeds, it will have gone a long way to silencing its critics.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/how-mexico-became-so-corrupt/277219/,

With drug-related violence affecting much of Mexico, large majorities describe crime (81%) and illegal drugs (73%) as very big problems, and Mexicans overwhelmingly endorse President Felipe Calderón’s tough stance against drug traffickers.Most believe life is better in the United States. Close to six-in-ten (57%) say that people who move from Mexico enjoy a better life in the U.S., up from 51% in 2007. And the vast majority of those who are in regular contact with friends and relatives living in the U.S. say those friends and relatives have largely achieved their goals.A substantial minority of Mexicans say that if they had the means and opportunity to go live in the U.S. they would do so, and more than half of those who would migrate if they had the chance say they would do so without authorization.Nonetheless, immigration data show a drop-off in recent years in the annual flow of Mexican immigrants to the U.S. This decline may be tied in part to the economic downturn in the U.S., which has resulted in fewer jobs for immigrants. Four-in-ten Mexicans say they know someone who left for the U.S. but returned because they could not find a job, although even more (47%) report knowing someone who returned because they were turned back by the border patrol.And some may see expanding job opportunities in the Mexican economy. Although 69% say the current economy is bad, most are upbeat about the future: 61% expect the national economy to improve over the next 12 months, while only 14% think it will get worse.The close ties between people in the U.S. and Mexico are reflected in the survey’s findings – 39% of Mexicans have friends or relatives in the U.S. Nearly one-in-five (18%) Mexicans say they receive money from relatives living in another country, although this represents a slight decline from 2007, when 23% said they received money from outside.These are the latest findings from the 2009 survey of Mexico by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1,000 adults in Mexico between May 26 and June 2, 2009. The sample is representative of the country’s adult population, and the margin of sampling error for the results is plus or minus three percentage points. The Mexico poll is part of a broader survey of 25 publics conducted by the Pew Global Attitudes Project (Mexico was surveyed as part of the Spring 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Survey, which included 24 nations and the Palestinian territories.

With more than 10,000 deaths from drug-related violence since President Calderón took office in December 2006, Mexicans clearly see this issue as one of the main challenges facing their country: 95% rate it a big problem.Calderón has responded to the drug traffickers with unprecedented force, deploying the army to major cities to combat the gangs. As the survey illustrates, the public overwhelmingly backs this strategy: 83% support using the Mexican army to fight drug traffickers, while just 12% oppose the idea.Moreover, most Mexicans believe the efforts are effective – 66% say the army is making progress against the traffickers, while only 15% think it is losing ground. The popularity of the tough stance against drug gangs seems to be bolstering support for Calderón. Roughly two-thirds (68%) have a favorable opinion of the president, while only 29% express an unfavorable view.There is also considerable support for U.S. assistance in fighting the drug war. Almost eight-in-ten want the U.S. to train Mexican police and military personnel, and 63% want the U.S. to send money and weapons to the Mexican police and military. However, there is little appetite for having American troops on Mexican soil – only 30% want U.S. forces deployed to Mexico to fight drug traffickers.The survey makes clear the extent to which Mexicans want law and order in their country. A majority (56%) believe that, right now, law and order should be a more important priority for the government than protecting personal freedoms. Only 18% believe individual freedoms should be the bigger priority, while about one-quarter (24%) volunteer that both are equally important.The survey also reveals serious differences in how some of the main institutions involved in the drug war are perceived. Mexicans largely approve of the job the military is doing – 77% say it is having a good impact on the country. On the other hand, the court system (37% say it is having a good impact) and the police (35%) receive generally poor reviews.The Pew Global Attitudes survey found that America’s overall image improved significantly across much of the world over the last year, and Mexico is no exception. While slightly less than half (47%) expressed a positive opinion of the U.S. in 2008, 69% do so now. Views of the American people also have become more positive since 2008.And in a pattern found throughout much of the world, President Barack Obama receives considerably more favorable reviews than his predecessor, George W. Bush. Interestingly, however, Mexico is one of the few countries included in the survey where the U.S. as a country receives higher marks than President Obama or the American people.Overall, Mexicans believe they benefit from the deep economic ties between the U.S. and their country – about three-in-four (76%) say that these ties are good for Mexico. Nonetheless, many see America’s economic crisis spilling across the border, and most say that, right now, the U.S. is having a negative economic impact on Mexico.When the survey was conducted in late May and early June, nearly all of those surveyed (93%) had heard of the swine flu (also known as the H1N1 virus). And most of those who had heard of it were worried that they or someone in their family could be exposed to the illness. Even so, despite the fact that the first outbreak of the 2009 swine flu began in Mexico, concern about the disease was lower among Mexicans than among several other publics included in the spring 2009 survey – in eight of the 25 publics, the level of concern about swine flu was higher than in Mexico.The Mexican government received high marks for its handling of the swine flu outbreak. Roughly three-in-four (76%) of those who had heard about the virus said the government was doing a good job of dealing with it. Support for the government’s handling of the crisis was widespread, both among those who identify with President Calderón’s National Action Party (PAN) (83% approve) and those who identify with the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) (77%).",http://www.pewglobal.org/2009/09/23/most-mexicans-see-better-life-in-us-one-in-three-would-migrate/,

Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Guilfoyle said Obamacare is ""one big fat VA system."" We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison.",Guilfoyle: Obamacare is 'one big fat VA',"The uproar over allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and delays that potentially cost veterans their lives has opened the Obama administration to criticism that it was slow to respond to the VA’s own internal reports.Some also see a connection between troubles at the VA and the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act.On Fox News’ , four of the show’s pundits built the case that if Obama digs deeply into the VA, it will raise more questions than he would like about how the Affordable Care Act is structured.When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a single-payer system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in.If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare, Guilfoyle said.Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year are going to die waiting for treatment because of Obamacare.Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to one big fat VA system.The VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running.Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies.But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country.In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule.Some notes about the Affordable Care Act:We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges.Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance, Buchmueller said.Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. It’s an army, Getzen said. In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation.Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office. They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently.Scott Harrington, an adjunct scholar with the conseravtive American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, described the changes under Obamacare as a step in the direction of a government-run health care system. But it’s a long way from getting there, Harrington said.The idea that the Affordable Care Act was a government takeover of health care was named as PolitiFact’s 2010 .Bolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result.President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare, Bolling said.At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients.You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits, Bolling said. If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples.While we won’t fact-check Bolling’s prediction, we do think it’s important to point out two problems with Bolling’s math for people who saw the segment. First, the projects that through 2024, 26 million people will gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So Bolling exaggerated the base number by about 50 percent.Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us.The average in the U.S. is between four and six, Getzen said. The reports that the average number of visits fell from 4.8 a year in 2001 to 3.9 in 2010.Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed.Guilfoyle said Obamacare is one big fat VA system. We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers.We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,

""Obamacare"" is not a health care system. The VA is.","No, the VA Is Not an Obamacare Preview","This article is from the archive of our partner As if it wasn't bad enough that dozens of veterans may have died because of the VA system's failures, some conservative pundits are turning the fear factor up a notch: This is what awaits us all under Obamacare, they claim. The health care system that the Veterans Affairs Department administers (or fails to administer) has almost nothing in common with the Affordable Care Act. No matter what specific series of failures led to the VA scandal, and even if Obamacare goes horribly, it would take enormous leaps of logic to connect the two. Not that needing enormous leaps of logic has ever stopped an anti-Obamacare talking point before. This is going to be the VA on steroids ¦ much, much worse, conservative icon Ben Carson — who is a doctor — said in an interview on Fox Business. Without question, people will die under Obamacare, just as veterans allegedly died because of the VA's mismanagement, Carson said.The real problem is not management, the New York Post editorial board wrote last week. The real problem is government-provided health care.¦ If the government can't even make such a system work for our vets, what makes anyone think it will work for the rest of us? If you want to argue that the VA's problems are a sign of what happens under true government control of a health care system, well, there's an argument to be made there. Some of the problems at the VA — namely, long waits to see certain doctors — are similar to the biggest complaints about other socialized or quasi-socialized health care systems, including the UK's. The VA is about as socialized as it gets: The government owns the hospitals, employs the doctors, and finances the coverage. And the VA is about as socialized as it gets: The federal government owns the hospitals, employs the doctors who work in those hospitals, and finances the coverage that veterans use to get care. Obamacare, though, is not socialized medicine. It's not a government takeover of the health care system. Sure, people call it that, and in comparison with charges like death panels, those characterizations don't sound so off-the-reservation. But they're still wrong. Most people accessing the health care system through Obamacare will do so by purchasing private insurance through the law's exchanges. The federal government regulates those insurance policies and requires them to cover certain services. The vast majority of exchange customers also receive subsidies, funded by the government in the form of tax credits, to help pay for their premiums. So it's not like the government isn't involved at all.But, unlike with the VA, no one on the exchanges is buying insurance from the government; it's all private coverage. The government doesn't decide how much that coverage costs. It doesn't employ doctors, or decide how much they'll get paid, or require them to accept any of the insurance plans sold through the exchanges. Obamacare is not a health care system. The VA is. Obamacare also expands eligibility for Medicaid, which is a government-run program. But it's still not socialized medicine like the VA: You don't use your Medicaid card to go to the Medicaid hospital for an appointment with the Medicaid doctor, the way veterans do with their VA coverage. If the GOP can't find the courage to enact fundamental reforms of the VA, it has no right to complain about Obamacare, conservative health care expert Avik Roy wrote in a blog post that suggests moving veterans into Obamacare's exchanges. The structure within the VA that allowed long backlogs to develop and, allegedly, allowed workers to create secret, off-the-books waiting lists, is a structure that has a lot to do with the specifics of that system. Private insurance doesn't create backwards incentives to trap patients in an endless appeals process, the way the VA apparently does. Plans sold through the exchanges offer different levels of benefits and different networks of doctors; the VA is the VA. The VA is a unique system with specific flaws. Its problems don't simply photocopy themselves onto the private insurance market just because they're both health care systems. You're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare, Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle said last week. Her cohost, Eric Bolling, went further and tried to extrapolate, based on the accusations about the VA, precisely how many people Obamacare would kill. If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting — apples to apples — 500 people will die on Obamacare Bolling said.

And if we can't get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans, how in the world with are you going to do it with the entire population?Radio host Rush Limbaugh built a similar case this week, saying the problems with the VA, which include reports of misconduct and crushing wait times that have been linked to dozens of deaths, provide only a glimpse of the broader havoc Obamacare will wreak.We still gotta find a way to convince people that this Obamacare can't work and that everybody's headed for a similar potential as these deaths in the VA, Limbaugh said, according to Mediaite. No matter how big anybody's heart is, no matter how much they care, here is a microcosm of what Obamacare is gonna be if it's fully implemented.And Fox News host Kimberley Guilfoyle warned on Wednesday that America can expect one big, fat VA system in the form of Obamacare if the health care law continues taking root.The link between the VA and Obamacare has not yet been made explicitly by elected Republican or other GOP officials, who may be reluctant to immediately politicize a scandal that affects America's veterans.Longtime Republican strategists Matthew Dowd and Alex Castellanos, for example, critiqued the efficiency of the VA bureaucracy on Sunday without broadening their indictment to include Obamacare. Dowd told ABC the scandal is evidence that there are some things, like health care, that the government doesn't do well and efficiently. Castellanos told CNN it's the perfect example of a top-down Washington bureaucratic system gone wrong.And when Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., was asked on CBS News' Face the Nation whether he worried that the scandal was becoming too politicized, he said he remains focused on the substance of the allegations, not the politics behind them.This is not about transient politics, he said. This really is an issue that needs to be solved. We're talking about the men and women who put their lives on the line.Still, the emerging commentary from conservative pundits linking the VA and Obamacare could be a look at where Republicans will take the narrative as the controversy continues churning.Left-leaning analysts have pushed back, disputing the charge that Obamacare will eventually create problems like those seen in the VA system.USA Today's Kirsten Powers emphasized a key difference between the VA system and Obamacare, saying the former is government-run single payer system, while the latter is merely a series of reforms of the private health insurance industry.Obamacare and the VA are not the same thing, she told Fox News Sunday. Of course, the VA is really government-run healthcare where you have the government controlling everything. That's not what Obamacare is.On that count, Powers received some backup from fact-checking website Politifact, which ruled Guilfoyle's claim that Obamacare will become one big, fat VA system false.The VA is owned and operated by the federal government, the website explained. Its staff are government employees.

We often throw the term ‘socialized medicine’ around to describe any government health care program, but the distinction is really important to understand.Socialized medicine, properly understood, is a system in which the state owns and controls everything. The government owns the hospitals; it employs the physicians; it pays for the health insurance and the health care. That, in a nutshell, is the VA. It’s also, for the most part, the system in place under the British National Health Service. . .Obamacare, he goes on to note, is not socialized medicine.  “Obamacare expands coverage in two ways: first, by creating Swiss-style exchanges where people can buy subsidized, regulated private insurance plans; and second, by expanding Medicaid. For all of the exchanges’ flaws—especially their high premiums—the quality of coverage they will offer is decent, and we should expect that uninsured people will do reasonably well on them, so long as they can afford the premiums. Medicaid is a different story; the literature shows that Medicaid does not improve health outcomes relative to being uninsured.”Yet both the VA scandal, and the foul ups with the ACA launch last fall, do have one thing in common: a dithering response by the administration to the “drip, drip, drip” of unfolding revelations of government incompetence.But there also is a huge difference between what occurred at the VA and Obamacare’s troubled enrollment launch.  The former is about denying government-run medical care to ill veterans who were promised it, and then lying about it, while the latter was about a broken government-run website making it harder for people to sign up for affordable (private) health insurance coverage regulated and subsidized by the government. We shouldn’t conflate the two.Yet supporters of Obamacare, and I am one of them, should acknowledge that  when the government screws things up, big time, and people get hurt as a result (think Hurricane Katrina, and now the VA scandal), it undermines public confidence in government.  Even before the VA scandal, only three out of ten Americans trusted the government to do the right thing most of the time.  And in that sense, the VA scandal likely will deliver another blow to Obamacare’s already shaky public standing.",http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/health-cents/What-does-the-VA-scandal-say-about-Obamacare.html,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Obamacare's hidden impact on the U.S. health care system,"As the debate heats up in Washington about how to replace the Affordable Care Act, the law’s supporters have — understandably — touted its successes in boosting the number of people with insurance and bringing health benefits up to a national standard. Yet so far, less attention has focused on just who has gained insurance under the law — and who would lose insurance if Republicans repeal it.We recently conducted a study on health coverage gains for direct care workers between 2010 and 2014, and we found that Obamacare has a hidden impact on the U.S. health care system that should become part of the debate. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the law are people in the health care industry itself — specifically, home health workers, who play an increasingly important role in delivering care to Americans but often aren’t covered by workplace insurance.About 500,000 paid caregivers obtained health coverage from 2010 to 2014 because of the ACA, according to research released this week by PHI, a national research and consulting group widely considered the leading expert on direct care workers. That reduced the uninsured rate among this workforce from 28 percent to 21 percent. These workers are central to the health care system, providing hands-on, paid care to older people and people with disabilities. It is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States and will become only more important as Americans age. It’s critical that these workers are healthy enough to perform their jobs — a frequent problem among home care workers, and one that Obamacare greatly reduced.Millions of people rely on long-term services and supports because of functional limitations, disabilities and chronic health conditions — and Medicaid serves as the primary payer for such services. While family members provide the majority of long-term services and support in home and community-based settings, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, direct care workers remain a critical part of this caregiving ecosystem for older adults and people with disabilities. From 2014 to 2024, direct care occupations will add more jobs than any other single occupation — an additional 1 million new jobs. In fact, demand for direct care workers will outpace demand for fast-food workers, retail salespeople, teachers, police and firefighters combined.Across the United States, nearly 5 million home care workers and nursing assistants support millions of older people and people with disabilities. They assist with activities of daily living such as eating, bathing and dressing, as well as tasks such as managing medication and preparing meals. Many of these workers — home health aides — perform clinical tasks such as blood-pressure readings under the supervision of a nurse or therapist. For many families, they are the extra support they need, and for many people, they are the only support they can access. And their importance is only going to grow in the years ahead as millions of baby boomers retire and need medical care.Most of these workers earn poverty-level wages and can’t afford to purchase health insurance on their own. Workers without insurance tend to avoid seeing the doctor, which means illnesses go undetected and worsen, making it impossible to fulfill the arduous, daily responsibilities of caregiving. Further, if illnesses go undiagnosed, they can fester and might get transmitted from workers to clients — a public health concern. These once-preventable illnesses inevitably get treated in hospitals, incurring significant costs for both patients and the public.Obamacare went a long way to solving some of these problems. Thanks to federal subsidies and the Medicaid expansion, half a million caregivers gained health insurance. In the 31 states that accepted federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility, the uninsured rate among these workers dropped 33 percent, as compared with 21 percent in non-expansion states. This has a direct, positive impact on direct care workers, many of whom make less than $10 per hour and aren’t offered insurance through their employer. It also benefits their clients, since workers with health insurance are likelier to stay on the job and have higher retention rates, according to various studies compiled by PHI.These effects will become only more profound in the years ahead, with the number of caregivers growing dramatically. However, if these jobs are mired by high turnover, which is spurred by low wages and a lack of affordable health coverage, we will struggle to find skilled candidates to fill these positions. Research demonstrates that paid caregivers are more likely to stay in their jobs if their employers provide health coverage — a retention-related factor more important than wages, according to some studies. Yet employers routinely relegate these workers to part-time work and irregular hours. At low wages, these workers don’t earn sufficient income to afford health coverage on their own, forcing them to go without coverage or, if they qualify, to sign up for Medicaid. This drives care workers away from the industry, even if they enjoy their jobs, as many do.Without those workers to fill home care cases or to staff nursing homes, family caregivers — who already provide roughly $470 billion a year in unpaid care — will be left with an even greater burden. Many family members already quit their jobs and incur sizable out-of-pocket costs to take care of loved ones. This is an invisible cost to the economy, reducing the overall workforce and taking healthy Americans from their jobs. As with other low-income workforces, the health of paid caregivers fuels the fiscal health of our entire economy. By helping them, Obamacare helped the entire U.S. health care industry and the economy.That’s what the current federal administration — President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress — must weigh as they reimagine health care in this country.Robert Espinoza is the vice president of policy at PHI, a leading authority on the direct care workforce, for which he oversees its national policy, research and communications activities.",https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/03/obamacare-hidden-impact-health-care-system-000345,

Whether or not Shinseki was a scapegoat, his departure will not satisfy the bloodlust of the GOP, nor cause them to defer attacks on President Obama long enough to actually help find solutions. However, their inbred negativity and hatred for Obama is causing them to misfire in ways that only further embarrass themselves.In yet another right-wing assault on the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare), the conservative opponents of health care have once again managed to mangle their message. Their intent has been to associate ObamaCare, which they viscerally despise despite its growing popularity, with the burgeoning scandal at the Veterans Administration.From across the Tea Party frontier we can hear the outraged call of the Yellow Tailed Wingnut complaining that ObamaCare will doom us all to fates of suffering, death, and worse – Socialism! Their high-pitched squeal is recognizable and notable for its uniformity.To be sure, the VA is undergoing a difficult period, exacerbated by Republicans in Congress obstructing necessary funding and the added burden of hundreds of thousands of new veterans created by Bush’s wars. And there is no excuse for falsifying records in order to mask the problems. But even with the serious issues surfacing in the past few weeks, the VA is a highly regarded institution that serves the vast majority of its patients with compassion and competence.A recent survey completed in 2013 for the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index (during the precise time period when the latest abuses allegedly occurred) reported that customer satisfaction among veteran patients was “among the best in the nation and equal to or better than ratings for private sector hospitals.” Ratings for satisfaction and loyalty were overwhelmingly positive, exceeding 80% and 90% respectively. And specific responses regarding quality of care were off-the-charts positive.The positive assessment of the VA’s overall performance, however, does not mean that problems should be ignored. There is obviously room for improvement. Unfortunately, Republicans are not interested in improvement. In fact, they are ideologically shackled to failure. Their whole political philosophy revolves around the belief that government is inept and incapable of doing anything worthwhile (except wage war). Consequently, their mission is to deliberately sabotage every government initiative they encounter.They aspire to failure because it proves their thesis that the only thing government excels at is failing. And it may even explain why the VA scandal is almost exclusively confined to red states like Arizona, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Is it just a coincidence that all of those GOP-led states, where local managers are responsible for the VA’s operations, are battling inefficiency and fraud? Or is it consistent with the Republican agenda that is also obstructing the Medicaid expansion provided by ObamaCare in many of those same states?Shameless self-promotion… Get Fox Nation vs. Reality. Available now at Amazon.Still, with broad-based, national survey results delivering such positive assessments, the rest of the country would be overjoyed to receive the sort of care that has pleased the vast majority of veterans. And if, as the wingnut brigade above asserts, the VA represents the future of health care under ObamaCare, then America is in for a real improvement in both medical outcomes and experiences. We can only hope that the Limbaughs and Coulters of the world are right this time, for a change.",https://www.newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p=15343,

(False.)","Medicaid Deaths, VA Woes, And Fox News Hypocrisy","Twisting itself in partisan knots, Fox News can't keep track of when denying health benefits to Americans is a good thing and when it's a bad thing. Here's a helpful crib sheet: Denying health care by expanding Medicaid is cheered by Fox News.  Denying health care through Veterans Affairs backlogs is not. The current VA controversy has unleashed waves of right-wing media attacks on the organization, which conservative commentators now depict as a failed government-run health care agency. (It's not.) Fueling their five-year obsession with trying to undermine and obstruct The Affordable Care Act at every turn, right-wing pundits have denounced the backlog that veterans face, the allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and claims that dozens of vets reportedly died while on a waiting list to see a VA doctor. Looking to score points politically, Fox News talkers have proclaimed the VA mess to be a preview of some sort of Obamacare debacle for the general public. Fox's Kimberly Guilfoyle recently labeled Obamacare one big fat VA system. (False.) Colleague Ben Carson tactlessly called the veterans health care failure a God send because it highlighted how awful Obamacare is going to be. And Fox's Eric Bolling claimed delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves nationwide under Obamacare, and 500 people are going to die waiting every year for treatment because of the president's health care reform law.   The larger Fox message machine has been focused: There's nothing worse, nothing more callous and unimaginable, than vets being denied the government health care they're entitled to, and some dying as a consequence. Left unmentioned from Fox and friends? In the case of the recent implementation of Obamacare and the federal government's effort to expand Medicaid benefits, Republican governors and lawmakers in 24 states have refused, for partisan reasons, to accept the federal funds to insure more of their citizens. The result? Citizens are being denied government health care they're entitled to, and thousands may die as a consequence.The Affordable Care Act was passed into law with the assumption that all states would expand Medicaid. But a Supreme Court decision ruled that states could opt out. Twenty-four did (five of which are either seeking waivers for alternate plans or currently debating adopting the expansion), immediately creating a coverage gap that engulfed millions Americans who are denied the benefits of expanded Medicaid and who don't qualify for premiums subsidies under Obamacare.Hardened ideologically, governors such as Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, Florida's Rick Scott, South Carolina's Nikki Haley, and Wisconsin's Scott Walker, took the extraordinary step of denying coverage to its citizens. Despite the fact taxpayers in those states are paying for the federal expansion of Medicaid, they're not eligible to receive it. The boycotts affect approximately five million people, including more than 250,000 U.S. veterans in those states.The list goes on.Fox News championed that deliberate political calculation to deny people insurance in red states. The same Fox team that now demands VA resignations over the fact too many vets have been denied health care and some have died while waiting for it, is the same Fox team that led the public charge to block Medicaid's expansion.Of course the VA should be held accountable and service to American veterans needs to be improved. But Fox News has shown absolutely no concern for the estimated 7,000-17,000 Americans who will die each year because of their state's failure to accept expanded Medicaid. That was the projection made in a study this year by professors at Harvard University and the City University of New York, and published in Health Affairs.We estimate the number of deaths attributable to the lack of Medicaid expansion in opt-out states at between 7,115 and 17,104.  Medicaid expansion in opt-out states would have resulted in 712,037 fewer persons screening positive for depression and 240,700 fewer individuals suffering catastrophic medical expenditures.  Medicaid expansion in these states would have resulted in 422,553 more diabetics receiving medication for their illness, 195,492 more mammograms among women age 50-64 years and 443,677 more pap smears among women age 21-64. Expansion would have resulted in an additional 658,888 women in need of mammograms gaining insurance, as well as 3.1 million women who should receive regular pap smears.All of those health care benefits, paid for by the federal government, are being denied to people in places like Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. (Prior to Obamacare, an estimated 45,000 Americans died each year due to lack of health insurance, according to a study by Harvard researchers.)And then there is the economic impact. By refusing to expand Medicaid, Texas will forgo $9.2 billion in federal funding in 2022, the authors said. Florida, another state that has said it won't expand Medicaid, stands to lose more than $5 billion, according to the Washington Post.As CBSNews.com reported in 2012, Some health care experts said it was unthinkable that state leaders would really opt out, since the vast majority of the cost is covered by the federal government -- taxes their citizens will pay, regardless of whether the state opts in or out. Unthinkable, indeed. But the policy quickly went mainstream within the Republican Party and was widely cheered by conservatives in the media.As Media Matters noted, when GOP governors began announcing they would reject the Medicaid expansion in July 2012, Fox & Friends praised Florida governor Rick Scott for doing so. That same day  Fox News contributor Sarah Palin appeared on On the Record and said she would like to see governors be tough and opt out of the expansion.How's that for Orwellian? Denying people health benefits they're entitled to, which in turn leads to thousands of deaths each year, now represents being tough.In the two years since, Fox has consistently attacked GOP governors who adopt the Medicaid expansion.Laura Ingraham slammed Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich -- a former Fox News host himself -- for embracing the Medicaid expansion. While guest-hosting him on The O'Reilly Factor, she termed Kasich Obama's BFF and suggested he wasn't governing in a fiscally responsible way. Neil Cavuto has questioned whether Republican governors who accept the Medicaid expansion but still say they oppose Obamacare are just as pregnant, just as a little bit pregnant?Ben Carson said that if he was advising the governor of Maryland on Medicaid expansion, I would say we need to start talking about something that makes sense. It doesn't make a lot of sense to invest a lot of our eggs in something that doesn't work. And Sean Hannity demanded that Republican party head Reince Priebus explain why GOP governors were going along with the expansion.As the Harvard/CUNY study made plain, Political decisions have consequences, some of them lethal. The difference between denying Medicaid benefits and the VA troubles today is that nobody from a political party or movement set out to make sure U.S. vets couldn't get access to the health care the government wanted to provide to them. But that's exactly what's happening in Republican states that have boycotted Medicaid's expansion. It's a deliberate move to deny health care.People are dying because of it and hypocrites at Fox News don't mind.",https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/05/28/medicaid-deaths-va-woes-and-fox-news-hypocrisy/199478,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,How the Democrats Are Failing Obamacare,"And last Monday, Aetna, another of the country’s largest carriers, withdrew from markets in 11 of 15 states, including Arizona. Aetna, suddenly bearish on the sustainability of the exchanges where it had recently been so bullish, made the announcement not long after the Justice Department had challenged its merger with the carrier Humana. The timing of the move is now under major scrutiny. Whatever hardball tactics Aetna may or may not have been employing don’t change the fact that it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on the exchanges (on a market cap of some $42 billion) and was seeking consolidation as a remedy. With Aetna and UnitedHealthcare out of the picture and Blue Cross paring back, the competition in much of Arizona, particularly its rural areas, will be sparse or nonexistent in 2017. And unless Blue Cross, sniffing out a monopolistic business opportunity, decides to re-enter, Pinal County will have no insurers offering plans on its exchanges.But it’s becoming clearer that the Affordable Care Act, for all its advances, is due for the sort of legislative maintenance that most major laws require after implementation. Two temporary federal programs, reinsurance and risk corridors, designed to cushion losses for insurers as they determined sustainable premium price points in new markets, expire in 2017 as the exchanges enter their fourth year of operation. Carriers serving sicker-than-expected pools or rural areas find that their options are either to sharply increase premiums or to leave the exchanges altogether. Average premium increase requests from insurers on the individual exchanges are well into the double digits across much of the country. And a Kaiser estimate in May projected the number of counties that could have a single exchange insurer in 2017 to be 664—70 percent of which are mostly rural—up from 225 in 2016. That number will increase following Aetna’s withdrawal and could reach roughly a quarter of all counties in the country. Alabama, Alaska, South Carolina, and Wyoming are set to have just one insurer offering coverage on their exchanges in 2017. Most of North Carolina, except for the Raleigh metropolitan region, will be down to one insurer as well.Many Democrats, meanwhile, are content to hide behind Republican incoherence and nefariousness instead of confronting the shortcomings of their signature legislative achievement. When I spoke with Kirkpatrick in late June and asked what specific policy changes she would propose to prop up the exchanges, she couldn’t name any off the top of her head—though she did point to the letter to demonstrate that she was asking HHS for advisement. Instead she gave me the usual anecdotes about people she’s met whose lives were saved by the coverage they received under the ACA, and how the Republicans want to reverse all of that.It’s not that she—or any of the other Democratic Senate candidates I reached out to asking about specific policy remedies they favor, to little response—isn’t aware of the problems or doesn’t care. (In a statement following Aetna’s departure, Kirkpatrick, for example, wrote that she would be “increasing pressure on the administration, state agencies and insurance companies to work together to find a solution.”) But they still largely see the public battle as a foundational one of protecting Obamacare’s existence against a Republican Party that hasn’t accepted its legitimacy. This is a reasonable position—as well as an excuse for ignoring both the law’s problems and certain politically inconvenient solutions. To reopen the book, for many of them, is to reinvite the fury of 2010 that helped end Democratic control of the House of Representatives and left Democrats with a bare majority in the Senate. And the law’s approval rating is still underwater.In the beginning of the campaign, Hillary Clinton, too, suffered from the “everything is fine!” bug, going so far as to red-bait Sen. Bernie Sanders over his Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders’ specific proposal suffered from some fuzzy math. But he understood that though the ACA was a vast improvement on an untenable status quo, its flaws really were flaws, and it made little sense to avoid confronting them just because doing so would be a pain. One staple of Sanders’ events during the campaign was to ask members of his crowds to raise their hands if they were facing sharp premium increases, and then to say how large the increase was. There was never a shortage of volunteers.It’s unclear how high a public option, and the political fight that will come with it, ranks atop Clinton’s list of priorities. But if 2017 open enrollment goes poorly and more insurers flee the exchanges, the public option—which has always polled well—would be an obvious go-to solution for restoring competition. The idea doesn’t rely on hand-holding private insurers until they feel properly incentivized to perform their societal function. It is a direct delivery of health insurance plans to health insurances exchanges. “Health care markets will inevitably differ from region to region,” Jacob Hacker, the Yale professor and so-called “father of the public option,” wrote in Vox on Thursday, “but there’s no reason every one of the existing marketplaces couldn’t offer a Medicare-like plan—a plan that’s stable; a plan with predictable costs; a plan that gives patients a broad choice of providers just as Medicare does.” It would also save money—$158 billion over 10 years, according to a 2013 Congressional Budget Office estimate.Progressives never gave up on the idea of the public option, even after efforts to include it in the original ACA fell short due to a combination of insurance industry pressure and red-state Democratic senators who were all afraid of being called communists and losing their seats if they supported it. (They were all called communists and lost their seats anyway.) That’s one version of the story, at least. The rise and fall of the public option is the subject of volumes and volumes of folklore, at least half of which seem to feature Rahm Emanuel (or Obama himself) in the role of the heavy, rapping his brass knuckles against the desk of any Democratic senator who entertained even a fleeting thought about government-sponsored health insurance. The truth, as best it’s been reconciled, is that while President Obama wanted a public option, what he wanted more was to keep industry and his own party’s senators at the table to push a law through. The public option was tradable. “They wanted to keep those stakeholders in the room,” former Sen. Tom Daschle, who played a behind-the-scenes role in the crafting and passage of the ACA, recalled in a 2010 interview, “and this was the price some thought they had to pay.”When I asked the campaign of Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Richard Burr, whether she would support a public option in light of the limited insurance options in her state, she changed the subject. “I am not for a single payer system, but I do want to improve the ACA by giving consumers more options,” she said in a statement. I am not a communist. I believe it would be bad to move from a private health insurance market to a Medicare-like system. “Moreover,” she continued, “the willingness of Aetna and other insurance companies to abandon folks who need health insurance coverage is just another reason it's a bad idea to give Medicare away to the insurance companies like Senator Burr has proposed.” But I also believe it would be bad to move Medicare to a private health insurance market. The Democratic Senate campaigns of Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania and Kirkpatrick in Arizona did not respond to inquiries about support for the public option. And the Florida Senate campaign of Rep. Patrick Murphy was unwilling to commit to a position on the public option now, even though he did support one during his first House race in 2012.But even a strong push for a public option can be useful. If fixing the Affordable Care Act reaches the congressional docket with some urgency, it can serve as a central piece of Democrats’ opening offer that eventually gives way to other compromise solutions. Republicans en masse won’t abandon their desire to eliminate the act. But with a new Democratic president beginning a term, it might be possible to peel off some Republican members of Congress who recognize that the law isn’t going anywhere, so why not improve on it in the meantime for their rural constituents? That may come in the form of increased exchange subsidies for families, doubled subsidies for community health centers, or a reauthorization of the reinsurance program.",http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/08/how_the_democrats_are_failing_obamacare.html,

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), voted against the measure because it didn’t go far enough to fully repeal the healthcare law. Two other libertarian-minded conservatives, Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Walter Jones (N.C.), also opposed it.The defectors were primarily centrists who had trepidations about voting for the bill after the addition of an amendment to let states apply for waivers from certain ObamaCare provisions that prevent insurers from charging sick people higher premiums and mandate which services insurance plans must cover.Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) was the only co-chair of the centrist Tuesday Group to vote no. Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a leadership ally, and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who negotiated the state waiver amendment, supported the bill.Dent said he thinks the proposal will increase health insurance costs for low- and moderate-income Americans, citing the original Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that estimated the bill would result in 24 million more uninsured people over the next decade.“Too much time and energy has been spent on meeting arbitrary deadlines and artificial timelines, all to improve the budget baseline for tax reform. We must and can do better,” Dent said in a statement.“It is my hope that cooler heads will prevail in the Senate,” Dent added.Hardly any Republicans opposed the bill over the rushed process that brought it to the floor. Republican leaders scheduled a vote before waiting for an analysis from the CBO estimating its effects.Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) was among the few to cite the lack of a CBO score as a reason for why he’d vote against the bill on Thursday.“I’m sympathetic to leadership’s challenge — getting 216 votes in this highly polarized environment isn’t easy. Also, as I have stated in the past, I’m certainly not going to vote on a bill of this magnitude that hasn’t been fully scored by the Congressional Budget Office and whose estimated price tag is unknown,” Coffman said in a statement hours before the vote.Jones, in a statement, called the rushed process used by GOP leaders without a revised CBO score shameful.As a result, no one has any idea how much those deals will cost the American taxpayers, or how they might affect the cost, quality and availability of health insurance coverage for American families, Jones said.Seven years ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said of the Obamacare bill: ‘You have to pass the bill so we can find out what’s in it.’ Sadly, the Washington Republican leadership is repeating the same mistakes.Other centrist Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps. Barbara Comstock (Va.), Ryan Costello (Pa.), Dan Donovan (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Jaime Herrera Beutler Jaime Lynn Herrera BeutlerAds target House Republicans over tax reform Working together on children’s healthcare The Hill's Latina Leaders to Watch MORE (Wash.), Will Hurd (Texas), John Katko (N.Y.), Leonard Lance (N.J.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Patrick Meehan (Pa.), Dave Reichert David (Dave) George ReichertMcCarthy: Virginia election ‘makes me nervous’ 12 House Republicans object to Alaska refuge oil drilling proposal Ads target House Republicans over tax reform MORE (Wash.), Chris Smith (N.J.) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.).All of the centrists except for Smith and Dent represent districts being targeted by the House Democratic campaign arm for the 2018 midterm elections.The remaining two Republican defectors, Ohio Reps. Mike Turner and David Joyce, are typically reliable leadership allies but weren’t able to support the legislation this time.“This bill will leave our most vulnerable citizens with inadequate health coverage. I cannot support a health plan to replace Obamacare that puts my constituents’ health benefits at risk,” Turner said in a statement after the vote.Many of the 20 Republicans will be barraged with ads tying them to the healthcare legislation, despite their votes against it.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Thursday it is launching digital ads in 30 districts, regardless of whether the Republicans holding them voted for the healthcare bill.Coffman, Joyce, Costello, Hurd and Comstock are among the Republicans whose districts will see the ads.- This story was updated at 4:46 p.m.",http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/331985-a-look-at-the-20-republicans-who-voted-against-obamacare-repeal,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Breitbart and Fox News commentators want Trump to ditch his Obamacare replacement,"A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Trump is further endangering the GOP healthcare push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it.From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing talk radio, as well as among friends who have Trump’s ear, the message has been blunt: The plan being advanced by congressional Republican leaders is deeply flawed - and, at worst, a political trap.Trump’s allies worry that he is jeopardising his presidency by promoting the bill spearheaded by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), arguing that it would fracture Trump’s coalition of working- and middle-class voters, many of them older and subsisting on federal aid.Vice President Pence and administration officials scrambled Tuesday to salvage the plan amid widespread dissatisfaction in both the Senate and House over the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate that 24 million fewer people would be insured in a decade under the Ryan proposal, titled the American Health Care Act.Trump - who has not yet fully used the bully pulpit of the presidency to rally support for the plan - spoke privately with Ryan on Tuesday afternoon. They discussed the various factions, the opinions of several key lawmakers and developing a closing strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the call.Trump loyalists warned that the president was at risk of violating some of his biggest campaign promises - such as providing broad health coverage for all Americans and preserving Medicaid and other entitlement programmes - in service to an ideological project championed for years by Ryan and other establishment Republicans.“Trump figures things out pretty quickly, and I think he’s figuring out this situation, how the House Republicans did him a disservice,” said Christopher Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. “President Trump is a big-picture, pragmatic Republican, and unfortunately the Ryan Republican plan doesn’t capture his worldview.”Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, published a column Tuesday urging Trump to “ditch” the current bill.Inside the White House, senior officials said they are taking note of the mounting opposition. “You can’t be so blind that you’re not seeing the outside noise,” said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorised to speak publicly.A second adviser, who also requested anonymity to speak candidly, said, “We take their views seriously and we’re listening, but we do appreciate when those concerns are shared privately and with a smaller megaphone.”Keeping Republicans on edge are several Trump advisers with tenuous ties to Ryan and the party establishment who might be more responsive than others to outside pressure, including chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.The White House strategy has been to spotlight what it sees as the urgent need to overhaul the health-care system rather than the legislative fix itself. At his Tuesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer highlighted “real-life examples” of “actual Americans” who shared with Trump stories of suffering in a listening session Monday.“These are the stories that are at the top of the president’s mind as he works towards reforming our health-care system,” Spicer said.This fresh public agitation from Trump loyalists comes as hard-line Republicans in Congress already stand opposed to the health-care bill. These lawmakers, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, see the proposal as insufficiently conservative because it is too reliant on tax credits and does not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, the law often known as Obamacare that was signed by President Barack Obama.Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the president should not be tempted by outside calls to abandon the Ryan bill and should instead “let the legislative process work.”“What’s happening now is a gut check,” he said. “It’s not unusual. People are figuring out what they’re going to stand tight on.”The cascade of opposition within Trump’s movement started flowing soon after the bill was unveiled last week and picked up speed this week. On Breitbart - the anti-establishment, conservative news site that has been a platform for Trumpism and was once run by Bannon - article after article has railed against a bill its headline writers excoriate as “RyanCare.”One heavily promoted story said that RyanCare was “a perverse economic system” and featured an interview with Rep. David Brat (R-Va.), a tea party hero who unseated then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014.Breitbart published leaked audio of Ryan on Monday that could undermine his relationship with Trump. The recording is of Ryan on a conference call with House Republicans last year, immediately following the release of the “Access Hollywood” video in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Ryan said on the call that he was “not going to defend Donald Trump - not now, not in the future.”Breitbart also has been promoting a rally Wednesday on Capitol Hill organised by FreedomWorks, a right-wing advocacy group that stoked the tea party movement. The event will feature Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.), who oppose Ryan’s health-care bill.Paul told reporters Tuesday that the plan was losing momentum: “There’s not really any kind of coalition that’s going to get the Ryan bill to pass. I think the CBO score makes it harder for him to pass his bill, and he’s losing the argument.”The rush by Ryan to quickly pass the health-care bill concerns some of Trump’s top supporters, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “I don’t think Americans care whether this bill passes by Easter or Memorial Day,” Cotton said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show.Republican strategist John Brabender said he observed a number of focus groups of Trump voters in Rust Belt states and found them willing to be patient about the timetable for overhauling health care.Brabender said the White House “should take a deep breath and not feel like anybody has to rush out and sign something they don’t feel good about... They have to be careful not to just quickly check a box and then own something around their neck for years.”Cotton dismissed promises from Trump and Republican congressional leaders of an evolving, multiphase process that would continue throughout the year.“There is no three-phase process,” Cotton said on Hewitt’s show. “There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk. It’s just politicians engaging in spin.”At the White House, Spicer was confronted at his briefing about Cotton’s criticism as an example of the administration lacking control over what its own supporters are saying. “It’s a free country,” Spicer said. “He can say what he wants.”Rush Limbaugh echoed Cotton’s concerns on his airwaves Tuesday. The conservative talk-radio commentator said the message from congressional leaders is: “We gotta pass the bill. We gotta send it up to president. No matter what’s in it, we gotta pass the bill.”“Passing the bill becomes the measure of success,” he continued, “and so that’s when the real dangerous horse-trading begins.”Limbaugh has sounded protective of Trump, explaining on his show last Friday that the president’s supporters should give him time to work out a better deal because he is “inside the sausage factory” for only the first time.“Trump is probably finding out just how deeply intertwined the tentacles of this are throughout our society, and what happens when you remove one tentacle?” he asked. “You find six more pop up that you didn’t know were there.”Fox News host Eric Bolling, who once considered joining the Trump administration and is friendly with the president, published an op-ed Tuesday on the network’s website that said Ryan and the “establishment GOP have pulled a fast one on President Trump.”“It’s time for President Trump to scrap the GOP health-care bill,” Bolling wrote.Conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham, a friend of Trump’s who was considered for a job in the White House, said Tuesday on Fox News that the Ryan bill is a “trap.”“I think Donald Trump is going to get caught on this in 2020,” she said, referring to the next presidential election. “I’d like to spend an hour talking to him about it. I think this is a trap set for Trump, and it’s going to be bad.”Former senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who was a key player in the battle over the Affordable Care Act in 2010, said of the current situation: “The Republicans are in an impossible position.”“Most of the people who are in opposition to this have never governed, don’t know how to govern and don’t want to govern,” Gregg said. “Unfortunately, Republicans now control the government and have to learn how to govern. The Laura Ingrahams of the world, who make their money agitating, aren’t functional in a situation where the president has to govern.”",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-breitbart-fox-news-commentators-pressure-president-obamacare-replacement-health-policy-a7631541.html,

Today, VA Secretary Bob McDonald appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss that budget proposal.While some may argue this is not a drastic move, every cut and rescission of funds has real-world implications for Veterans across the country. Here are three ways these proposed congressional cuts will adversely affect the quality of care and services provided to Veterans next year if they are not reversed:The Veterans Health Administration has expanded access to care, completing more than 46 million appointments between May 1, 2014, and Feb. 28, 2015. That’s an increase of 2 million more completed appointments than during the same time period in 2013-2014. VA has also begun to turn the corner on wait times – 97 percent of appointments are completed within 30 days, including 12 million same-day appointments.The 2016 House proposal reduces VA medical care by $690 million. What does this mean? As a result of the overall cut to medical services, an estimated 70,000 fewer Veterans will receive the VA care they need.Also wrapped up in the cuts to medical care is a reduction of $582 million to address VA’s high priority construction projects. This cut will reduce VA’s ability to provide additional outpatient services and will impact four major construction projects, including the long sought-after French Camp Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Livermore, California.The National Cemetery Administration is consistently rated top in customer satisfaction for its work in honoring our nation’s Veterans and maintaining 3.3 million grave sites across 131 cemeteries. Proposed cuts would eliminate funding for several key cemetery expansion projects, reducing our ability to provide burial honors for as many as 18,000 Veterans and eligible family members each year.Editor’s note:  This blog was updated to include a release from the Office of Management and Budget.",http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/19356/how-1-4-billion-in-budget-cuts-will-impact-veterans/,

Not by a long shot.  The challenges facing healthcare in this country are enormous. While I may not have answers, there is no downside to generating discussion on alternatives.  Feel free to comment on anything you feel is wrong with my suggestion.The problem legislators are facing in their attempts to “Repeal and Replace” or even modify Obamacare in a manner that will make their constituents happy is that they can’t answer one very important question-The stakeholders in Obamacare are the Insurance Companies, Health Care Providers and Consumers.Will Insurance Companies be willing to take lower profits ?Will Health Care Providers be willing to charge less for the services they are providing or take less reimbursement ?Will Consumers have to accept fewer services and lesser quality of care ?No stakeholder is willing to take less. Which is why it will be near impossible to “fix Obamacare” in a way that makes consumers, also known as voters, insurers and healthcare providers happy.Politicians can deflect and promote the benefits of a free market, but the free market shows itself every day in the profits of insurers and healthcare providers. I have yet to see a single public company in these spaces make an announcement that they are willing to or expect to take less because of changes to Obamacare. Have you ?So what should happen ?There are 2 risks that every single citizen of the United States shares:1. We all can lose the genetic lottery and find ourselves getting seriously ill or worse.2. We all can lose the “wrong place, wrong time” lottery and find ourselves facing a significant or life threatening injury.We all can take steps to reduce those risks, but it is literally impossible to eliminate them. On any given morning, every single person can wake up, feel a little off and soon come to find they are sick.At any given moment we can be in the wrong place and something catastrophic happens. A car. A bus. A baseball bat. A knife. A bullet.  etc.  All of the sudden our loved ones are praying for us.Today, we deal with those fears by doing our own versions of risk management.  Most of us try to get a job that offers health insurance. Even if its a job we don’t like, we realize that if we lose in either of these lotteries we won’t be able to afford the health care we need.Some of us do our best to afford the least expensive health care insurance with high deductibles and lie to ourselves that we will be able to save enough to cover the deductible or we can keep enough open on our credit cards to survive a disaster. Unfortunately,when disaster hits, we rarely have enough.Some of us, like I did in my 20s feel invincible and think it won’t happen to us. Until it does.Which leads to my suggestion.Not one single person in this country is immune to losing the Genetic or Randomness of Life Lottery. Not one. Doesn’t matter if you are rich, poor, white, black or whatever religion you are, if any. We all have close to the same odds of getting ill or being in the wrong place at the wrong time.It’s time we recognize these facts and deal with them accordingly.Whether its Medicaid or a new program, every single person in this country should be covered 100pct for chronic physical or mental illness and for any life threatening injury.The premiums that we are paying to insurance companies as individuals or as company coverage for these significant risks would go from the insurance companies to the IRS. Only the cost of covering the what’s left would continue being paid to the insurance companies.It would not be hard to do the math. Every insurance company does this analysis already. The government does this analysis already. We all would end up paying  more in taxes, but less in insurance and healthcare costs over time.There would be no mandates. There would be no individual penalties.  No Tax Credits. No subsidies. No Offsets or deductions for buying higher end insurance. This will be single payer (yes i know its a dirty phrase in this country) for chronic physical or mental illness and for any life threatening injury.Everything not covered by the above can be covered by insurance sold on the Free Market, managed by the states, sold across state lines, without government interference.There will be unique opportunities for insurance companies to innovate knowing they wont have to face the most expensive healthcare problems and they can have the cushion of knowing that illnesses and injuries that they covered that transition to those covered by Single Payer Advanced will be reimbursed.We all share the same risks, we all can share the costs of our greatest risks.The  peace of mind this would bring to every family would make our country stronger. I know with certainty it won’t reduce innovation in healthcare. Technology is going to continue to boom and change our future.There is something for everyone to hate in this. It doesn’t cover as wide a range of healthcare options as Obamacare, but it covers everyone. Immediately. No paperwork required. It is more humane, cost effective and fair than what the Republicans have proposed so far.Which means everyone can rip it to pieces. Which is exactly what I want everyone to try to do in the comments so we can see how to make the concept betterPS – On the issue of drug prices, I would include an MFN for pricing for this government pricing.  Whatever the best price is you give to anyone, you have to give to this program.",http://blogmaverick.com/2017/03/08/some-thoughts-on-fixing-obamacare-shoot-holes-in-this-please/,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Watch Live: President Trump Delivers Health Care Statement,"PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you very much, Vice President Pence, Secretary Price. And thank you, everyone, for being here today.   For the past 17 (sic) years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent, hard-working Americans.   Behind me today we have real American families, great families -- just spent a lot of time with them -- who are suffering because seven years ago a small group of politicians and special interests in Washington engineered a government takeover of healthcare. Every pledge that Washington Democrats made to pass that bill turned out to be a lie. It was big, fat, ugly lie.   Democrats promised Americans like Steve Finn (ph), a former police officer in West Virginia, that they would save $2,500 a year under Obamacare. Instead his premiums have more than tripled. That's pretty bad. As a result of Obamacare's skyrocketing costs, Steve (ph) and his family and many of his employees had no other option than going on Medicaid and giving up their existing coverage.   That's pretty bad. No choice, right? No choice. For them Obamacare's promise was a nightmare. Marjorie (ph) and Kevin Weir (ph) from South Carolina have a son, Monty (ph), who suffers from spina bifida. Washington Democrats promised families like the Weirs (ph) that if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor. But now there's only one insurer left in the state exchange, and Marjorie (ph) says that every year she waits anxiously to learn if the doctors and hospitals which her son needs the most will remain in their network. More Obamacare lies.  And you've seen that up front unfortunately, up front and personal.  The Democrats promised Melissa Atkinkson (ph) that her son's preexisting conditions would be covered. The Atkinson's (ph) quickly learned that Obamacare's promise of covering for preexisting conditions was meaningless, though, if the doctors you need to care for you aren't on your Obamacare plan. So you just have a meaningless promise, and everybody knows it, and most people on Obamacare know it.   After an excruciating series of events and complications, Melissa (ph) and her husband found themselves, just before Christmas, emotionally and financially devastated, crying in a doctor's office faced with yet another seemingly unpayable bill.  When insurance wouldn't cover the Atkinson's (ph) care, they emptied out Melissa's (ph) 401(k) to pay their bills. They're not going to be, and they haven't been the first. There are many, many cases such as that, the 401(k)s.  The first rule of medicine is, do no harm. What Obamacare's lies have caused this, and throughout the whole country, families like this, nothing but pain. Erin (ph) and Andy Witsick (ph) are small business owners from Illinois. They have six children.  Their youngest daughter, Poppy (ph), has a rare genetic condition. Children born with it are sometimes called butterfly children, because their skill is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. Poppy (ph) has to wear special bandages all of the time.  Unfortunately, under Obamacare Poppy's (ph) insurance has been repeatedly discontinued and replaced with what Washington deems equivalent policies. But for Poppy (ph), these plans are not equivalent, and Poppy's (ph) family has to spend precious time and tremendous resources fighting for exceptions for Poppy (ph).  The Washington politicians who made those promises to Steve (ph), Marjorie (ph), Melissa (ph), Erin (ph) and their beautiful children want to ignore all the pain, all the suffering, and all of the money, the tremendous amounts of money, that these lies have caused. They want to forget about the countless Americans they've hurt, and the many that they are continuing to hurt everyday, by refusing to help us replace Obamacare.  For the last seven years, Republicans have been united and standing up for Obamacare's victims. Remember repeal and replace, repeal and replace? They kept saying it over and over again. Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law.  We, as a party, much fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country to repeal and replace, what they've been saying, for the last seven years. But so far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.  They now have a chance however, to hopefully, hopefully fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time, and that is through replacement of a horrible disaster known as Obamacare.   The Senate is very close to the votes it needs to pass a replacement. The problem is we have zero help from the Democrats. They're obstructionists. That's all they are, that's all they're good at is obstruction, making things not work. They say all the right things and then they do exactly what they're not supposed to be doing.  The Democrats aren't giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans, not easy to do.   The Senate bill that is being considered outside of the outright repeal of Obamacare will also provide emergency relief for the law's victims, and it will deliver truly great healthcare and healthcare reforms that our citizens want, need, and really should be demanding -- some are demanding. You'll see that at the voter booth, believe me.   Here are just some of these terrific reforms that we will be doing if everything works out the way it should. The Senate bill eliminates the painful individual mandate. It eliminates the job- killing employer mandate, repeals other burdensome taxes, and will significantly lower American's premiums.  It will stabilize collapsing health insurance markets and give Americans far more choice and far more flexibility. The Senate bill protects coverage for preexisting conditions. And you don't hear this from the Democrats. They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn't even know the bill. They run out, they say, death, death, death. Well, Obamacare is death. That's the one that's death. And besides that, it's failing so you won't have it anyway.  It dramatically expands popular health savings accounts. It provides tax credits so Americans can purchase a private plan that is right for them and their families. It devotes substantial resources to fight the opioid -- and this is a tremendous problem, the opioid epidemic; $45 billion is being put in so that the people of many states like New Hampshire, Ohio, and so many others that have such a big problem, can be helped and helped greatly. Going to be fighting the drug problems very, very seriously in my administration.   And it provides, among many other things, higher quality care and more flexibility for states to administer Medicaid to better serve their poorest citizens.   Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether to allow this urgently needed bill to come to the Senate floor for debate.   The question for every Senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare's architects which have been so destructive to our country, or with its forgotten victims.  Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, which is what it is. For Democrats, this vote is a chance to make up for the terrible harm they have inflicted on Americans like those who are with us today. Obamacare has been for them a nightmare. There is still time to do the right thing.  And for Senate Republicans, this is their chance to keep their promise. Over and over again they said repeal and replace, repeal and replace. But they can now keep their promise to the American people to provide emergency relief to those in desperate need of help, and to improve healthcare for all Americans.   To every member of the Senate, I say this: the American people have waited long enough. There's been enough talk and no action. Now is the time for action.   We here to solve problems for the people. Obamacare has broken our healthcare system. It's broken. It's collapsing. It's gone. And now it is up to us to get great healthcare for the American people.   We must repeal and replace Obamacare now. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much. Thank you.",https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/07/24/watch_live_president_trump_delivers_health_care_statement.html,

With a Senate vote possible this week on some sort of health care reform, here’s a roundup of your views. Write us at letters@dailysignal.com about our news and commentary.—Ken McIntyreDear Daily Signal:  Forgive me, but isn’t all of this just more political nonsense and posturing? Regarding Rachel del Guidice’s report, “Conservatives Look for Lower Premiums in Senate’s Revised Health Care Bill,” it is a known fact, period, that free markets bring costs down. Government, no such thing.Members of Congress are having to rework this thing over and over to get the premiums down, because the crap that they do to control the market makes premiums increase. Isn’t that the way government intervention works?I am all for assisting those who are less fortunate. Pretty much all of us are. So put that in a health care bill.Subsidizing (using our tax money for) health care for worthy Americans is fine by me. Even the idea of not allowing companies to dismiss you for pre-existing conditions—not sure about all that, but it seems fair.After that, get out of the health care business, pull out the government barriers and typical regulations on business. It will still be a mess, just a smaller one.—Brian RoodRachel del Guidice reports that Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, “emphasized that the major goal is to drive down skyrocketing health insurance premiums under Obamacare.”And that summarizes the problem. To accomplish that, the Senate’s proposed health care bill adds money, adds benefits, and generally has government take a bigger role.The “major goal” should not be to lower premiums, increase coverage, or anything except getting the federal government out of the health care business. If states want to do it, go for it. But Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are not the business of the federal government. Those programs create dependencies that keep us all “peaceful on the plantation.”—Steffan CallosaIn September, my wife and I will be moving onto Medicare. Our monthly premiums will be about half of what we pay now. We are healthy people who have been paying $20,000 per year for health insurance.Let’s be real. Since Obamacare was implemented we were paying for nothing less than catastrophic coverage. With the deductible over $6,000, the plan is obviously not typical insurance. It is catastrophic care.Our plan is loaded with coverage for events we will never use, and aren’t even relevant to us at our age. What I wonder is where do I go to get back all the excess money I’ve paid since Obamacare was thrust upon us?It has negatively affected us in many ways. They knew Obamacare was a canard. It was never going to save money for me or secure better health care. This is another glaring example of why you don’t want bigger, unconstitutional government in your life.—Stephen TabelingI have the utmost confidence that whatever version, with whatever name, is ultimately pushed through, it in no way will have any resemblance to the tough talk of total repeal, which was promised but was never going to be delivered. If precedent is an indicator, the usual end result of anything the government gets its claws into is increased cost, decreased efficiency, and fewer options, rife with unchecked fraud.—Bill JamesDear Daily Signal: Regarding Jarrett Stepman’s commentary, unless you are blinded by the maniacal dogma from the left, it’s hard to deny what a total train wreck Obamacare has been for the average American (“7 Years of Promising Obamacare Repeal Leaves Republicans Just 1 Option“).Perhaps a very small percentage of people actually are better off with it, but why do they dictate how health insurance is designed at the expense of everyone else? This is absurd.And equally absurd is the Republican cowardice on getting rid of this mess, and allowing the Democrats to cover them with all the horrible lies about Medicaid cuts and other equally ruinous claims. After eight years of having to endure President Obama and his condescending attitude toward Middle America, the Republicans are still doing nothing to fight him and his ugly work.This is worse than shameful. What is the point in voting for your senator or congressman? You might as well just vote for goat turds like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.—Brad GillepsieI am far from a socialist, but in the present situation perhaps single payer health care should be looked at. It’s a shame, but the huge entitlement in Obamacare makes it almost impossible to fix.—Ray StylesObamacare is failing. People who buy insurance on their own and off the exchanges have been hit with incredible increases in premiums.The pre-Obamacare premium for a family of four was $507 per month with a $10,000 annual deductible. Today, the premium is $2,032 per month with $14,300 deductible and we are healthy. It is not sustainable in its current form and the proposed bills from Congress have not addressed these issues.All types of insurance are risk-based. A low risk equates to a low premium, higher risk equates to a high premium. Mandating coverage requirements that are inflexible (the one-size-fits-all approach) simply do not work. People need to be able to purchase the coverage that meets their needs.Possible solutions: Allow insurance to be sold across state lines; eliminate in-network and out-network requirements (your having insurance means all medical doctors and hospitals accept it); create a high deductible plan ($10,000 to $15,000 per year) for single people over age 26 with no co-pays at a low premium. This would give this age group coverage for major injuries, but the individual would be personally responsible for all other medical bills until deductible is reached.Cost likely would be $200 per month or so. Let the government create and subsidize a high-risk pool for people with cancer, heart disease, and other issues, and don’t require private insurance companies to provide coverage to this group.—Steven TrinkausYou would think that after eight years of an administration that spent most of its time playing politics, Republican members of Congress would at least do what they said they were going to do: Repeal and replace Obamacare.Fun and games are over. People are being hurt by Obamacare and its escalating costs with nontreatment because people can’t even afford to use the care they’ve paid too much for.Now that the Republicans have proved they had no intention of repealing Obamacare, it’s President Trump’s turn to reveal to America those who are unwilling to reverse this nightmare. Let’s remember all the Republicans who gave their word and then broke it once the chips were on the line.—Juan L. BassettHear this, Congress: If you voted against or said you would not vote for the repeal of Obamacare, I intend to vote against you in the primary. I will do my best to go against all the RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) in Congress. I am starting to prefer the true conservatives; they are much more principled.—Jim Clooney“Follow the money.” That is what will tell folks what is really going on with all this delay and inaction from the RINOs.My bet is that the insurance industry is heavily donating (bribing) the leadership in both houses to obstruct any real solution to the Obamacare debacle. There will be no movement toward repeal as long as the insurance lobby does not see a kickback to them in the form of subsidies or bailouts.Congress critters are bought and paid for by special interests, not we the people. Way past time to “drain the swamp” and call out the RINOs for what they are, special interest prostitutes beholding to no one except the ones who grease their palms with big bucks.—Jules P. GuidryDear Daily Signal: In response to Robert Moffit’s commentary, we do not need socialized health care in any way, shape, or form—period (“Why the Revised Senate Health Care Bill is a Major Improvement Over the Status Quo”). My nephew’s half-brother has Crohn’s disease. He started getting symptoms when he was 19, and had no health insurance.Unlike a Medicaid patient, he was seen by a top specialist in Seattle, who gave him the best care available and signed him up to receive experimental treatment—again, not available to Medicaid patients.Studies have proven that those on Medicaid have worse health care outcomes than the uninsured. Also look at the Department of Veterans Affairs and at Canada.Some 40 million people live in Canada and it takes months to see a specialist there, even if you are a millionaire. About 18 million people are on VA health care and wait months for surgeries and to see specialists.The U.S. population is 320 million; how do you think a single-payer system, which is what this will lead to, is going to go work out?—Robert Mulligan, Spokane, Wash.President Trump signed an executive order repealing the Obamacare mandates and taxes on his first day in office. Why did Congress not do the same? The GOP is a big proponent of choice, so why no choice in health care?One of the first choices for the consumer should be Obamacare or “Health Choice.” What can the Democrats say about consumers who choose to buy the doctor’s care and insurance of their choice, or to buy Obamacare? If the GOP is correct, then all will move out of Obamacare.Health care needs to be discussed in a public forum, and a new segment enacted every week. Nice and simple, fit it on a single sheet of paper where no swamp creature can hide.Does it sound reasonable? Then enact it. Does a previous one need some adjustment? Then amend it.Obamacare has a certain following and demagoguing it makes the best political advertisements in the world: Here comes Paul Ryan pushing Granny in the wheelchair off the cliff.Why not just let lovers of the Affordable Care Act make up their own minds on what is best?—Toby WitersteenLet’s get the government out of health care in general, taking care of the elderly and to others only in national needs such as natural disasters. Let the free market take care of the rest.—Ron PipichWhat has happened to you, Heritage Foundation? Are you now progressive and no more conservative? The Republican Party promised repeal, not Obamacare-lite.—Tina Gallo WilsonJust repealing the horrendous disaster that is Obamacare is a major step. It will put us on the road away from socialism, always a failed concept, and toward free market capitalism. Competition always works, whether it is business, health care, or the marketplace of employment.—Rich NewhouseOn the Question of Continuous CoverageDear Daily Signal: While this seems like a logical solution in Edmund Haislmaier’s commentary, the reason health coverage was offered by region is that premium pricing needed to reflect the cost of health care in that region (“The Senate Should Offer a Range of Options to Encourage Continuous Insurance Coverage“). Clearly, doctor and hospital costs in New York City are very different than in Wheeling, West Virginia.The best solution would be realized by repealing Obamacare and telling the insurance companies that until a new government program is developed, they are able to set up individual coverage and make it available in the way they think best. At least people in counties and areas with no option for coverage could buy something.Because the cost of setup is high, the government could guarantee that each program the insurance company sells will have a three-year term minimum. The government then could focus on special areas of need for those who have to have help.—Christopher MoodyThe solution is to phase out third-party payment of health care. Just like government-subsidized student loans caused an uncontrolled rise in four-year college tuition, third-party payments cause health care costs to rise. Both are due to the disconnect between the actual consumer and the provider, allowing layers and layers of consultants and middlemen to insert themselves into the supply chain. When the consumer directly pays, costs and bureaucratic overruns are kept in check.—Eileen MachidaFor over a decade, my wife and I had a “high” deductible health savings account. We loved it. We had “reasonable” premiums that would help to build up our available cash in the account.We would pay for all of our annual medical expenses from this account. If we exceeded $4,000 in a year, the insurance company began paying. (Basically, it was “major medical insurance.”)Our cash reserves would roll over each year. When we had about $10,000 in reserves, the surplus would go into an interest-bearing retirement account. This encouraged us to be cost conscious because it was our money.We actually saw the cost of all procedures. The insurance company still negotiated prices on our behalf. We paid the first $4,000 with a Visa debit card. The amount would be deducted from our reserves. It paid to be healthy and cost conscious.—Tommy MooreheadWe are now aware that those Obamacare mandates that force insurers to provide coverage for the previously uninsured were put into place for the express purpose of breaking the insurance companies, so that we could be forced into government-controlled and -provided health care. The requirement that insurance companies cover any applicant, regardless of condition or previous coverage, creates an unfunded mandate; it is not insurance. This is third-party health care coverage and nothing else.Medicaid, high risk pools, charities, and other types of assistance are appropriate for those who will not or cannot purchase insurance, but now we’re talking about emergency services or health care, not insurance.The system that we had in place before Obamacare was providing better health care than any other system in the world. People who wished to have insurance had the choice of medical cost-sharing (Medishare, Samaritan’s Purse, Christian Brotherhood, etc.), prepaid health plans (Kaiser), or traditional insurance.The escalation of costs was due to liability issues, government interference, and provider’s greed; those were the issues that needed to be addressed instead of attempting to create a single-payer system.Our individual and corporate freedoms have become more and more limited as government has taken over banking, investments, retirement options, auto manufacturing, fuel production, farming, housing, energy production and consumption, and now … health care. We have become subjects, rather than citizens, and have sacrificed liberty for an impossible socialist dream.—Bill TanksleyDear Daily Signal: Sounds like a fantastic idea to me (“Cruz, Lee Push Amendment to GOP Health Care Bill to Give Insurers More Options“). I neither want, and certainly cannot afford, an Obamacare-compliant plan.For example, as a 48-year-old male who doesn’t drink or take drugs, why in the world would I pay for maternity coverage or drug rehab coverage?I simply want a good catastrophic plan, and the rest I’ll budget for and use my health savings account. I certainly don’t need some arrogant D.C. Democrat specifying what I need in my insurance coverage.Give me the freedom to purchase the insurance policy that matches my needs and my budget—Thomas LuedekeI know a whole lot of people who lost health insurance because of the ridiculous Obamacare. We were all better off paying the fine, considering we couldn’t even use the ridiculous Obamacare until we met a ridiculous deductible. Obamacare was designed to fail so the Democrats can throw single payer at the American people to control what can or cannot be done for us.It has nothing to do with hating liberals but everything to do with freedom, which shouldn’t allow government to tell us what is best for us. Use some common sense.—Rebecca Webb Avigliano, Charleston, S.C.Anyone been to an emergency room lately? If you’re lucky, prepare for an eight-hour stay before you’re released. If you’re fortunate, they’ll allow you in. Ambulances are turned away because of overcrowded rooms.On July 9, my wife broke her ankle in a Home Depot lot in Chicago, and this was our experience. It was a good neighborhood on the North Side.This is what the liberal, progressive Democrats have done to us with their mountains of endless, intrusive, destructive laws requiring dumpsters full of paperwork to satisfy programs like HIPAA instead of using the time for care.Seats filled in waiting rooms, people on gurneys in hallways for hours, waiting for their trip to get an X-ray or other exams, then waiting for the one doctor to make the rounds. In the near future, these doctors, those who are the smartest in our classrooms, will be software engineers because all this b.s. is just not worth it.The American people continue to tolerate the politicians, bureaucrats, liberal news pundits, and community activists who endlessly sell us the single-payer health system, while often we hear about the VA nightmare.Government doesn’t run anything efficiently; it wastes over $200 billion a year in fraud, abuse, and overlapping redundancies. We are allowing the destruction of the greatest health care system in the world.Repeatedly we’re told of the concerns for the 22 million uninsured; that’s a lie, a fake number from liars. How did people manage before Obamacare? For the few, the health care quality of over 320 million people will be affected forever. There’s no turning back from this.—Art AntonHere’s what we don’t want to acknowledge about health care insurers: No matter what type of plan they offer, they will dictate a price that includes maximum profit and lowest risk. They own the data to be able to do that.They once again will spend hundreds of millions to not deliver their product. Insurance is the only business sector that can do such an obscenity.They once again will include small print in the plans, to their benefit. They again will offer plans with maximum limits. They again will cherry-pick by pricing out or denying undesirables (sick people) coverage.They will form a cartel with providers and pharmaceutical manufacturing to mutually negotiate maximum profits that are spread across all national health care users. They have easy access and power to beneficially negotiate with state insurance commissions.They are able to buy federal politicians who oppose legislation for a less costly government single-payer system that eliminates middleman insurers. And they threaten to cut off millions of people’s health care if they do not get their way with government regulators.—John KominitskyThank you, Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. But honestly, I believe that something like their amendment should have been in the Senate health care bill from the beginning. In fact, it should have been the “heart and soul” of the bill.What on Earth were the rest of the Republicans in Congress thinking and waiting for the last eight years? Frankly, they should be embarrassed that Cruz and Lee, at virtually the last minute, had to ride in and save them from disaster.If I understand the Cruz-Lee amendment correctly, insurers would be free to offer any insurance plan the market wants. That is just doing things the free market way, the American way.When leftists design a program and bureaucrats make the key decisions, nothing works. But, when the people are free to chose from an open and free market, everyone (except the bureaucrats and the left) prospers.—Mike BriggsAbout That CBO Score of the Senate BillDear Daily Signal: Nobody knows these government projections for the cost of health insurance premiums, which Drew Gonshorowski writes about in his commentary, will prove to be accurate. They are only projections by the Congressional Budget Office (“What the CBO Score Means for the Senate Health Care Bill“).No one in the Congress can be a hero by replacing the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare must be repealed, cleanly repealed. Congress then needs to:—Repeal legislation that handcuffs insurance companies by telling them who must be covered.—Repeal legislation that handcuffs insurance companies by telling them what must be covered.Let the insurance companies—those who understand what is marketable and where differences between markets exist—offer different packages for mature citizens, for families, for individuals, for everybody to whom they wish to sell packages.Some citizens will be uninsurable or will be unable to afford insurance because they represent too much risk or their income is insufficient. Let the state and local governments support those within their jurisdictions who need help.This would be health care support, not insurance but welfare, charity. If this number is 20 million or even more, so be it.At least we won’t be trying to fit 320 million into one program that hurts as many as it helps, won’t drive up the costs to insure the healthy, and won’t place a burden on the economy by preserving another uncontrollable entitlement program. Repeal and get out of the way.—Ron BellaIn what was termed a free market, I had insurance for $240 a month. After Obamacare, the rate tripled and the deductible went from $2,500 to $6,250. Just go back to pre-Obamacare for most and come up with a solution for pre-existing conditions.—James Bowen, Port Orange, Fla.We never had a truly free market. What we had was:Insurance monopolies on states (no competition). Inability to buy insurance across state lines (same reason).Frivolous lawsuits driving up costs (need tort reform). Plus skyrocketing malpractice costs to doctors and redundant, unnecessary added tests because of that.No transparency in hospital charges. Overburdensome government regulations on drug innovation.What I had was Blue Cross/Blue Shield at $240 a month, $1,200 deductible. After the Affordable Care Act? I paid $600 a month with a $5,000 deductible. No kickbacks.I’m now on Medicaid, thanks to certain voters. We now have doctors leaving practice in droves because of certain voters, fewer entering the field.But on the other hand, as a man I have maternity care.Government is the reason for this mess from the get-go. And government most certainly will not be the answer. Follow the money, not liberal bias.—Dean HunkelePence Hears From Those Hurt by ObamacareDear Daily Signal: Having read Fred Lucas’s report on Vice President Mike Pence’s meeting with Obamacare “victims,” here is the beauty of Russian roulette health insurance (“Americans Struggling Under Obamacare Tell Pence ‘Real Story’“). If you don’t have a policy, you can walk into any emergency room in the USA and get treatment. Federal law says hospitals cannot turn people away.So why buy any insurance if you can structure your life so no one can seize your home, car, or other personal property? It’s only the suckers or people who own stuff who need insurance.—William J. PowersToo many people want health care for nothing. Throwing able-bodied people on Medicaid was disastrous. Too many people are freeloaders.—Sheryl SodenToo many were denied some care when they most needed it. Not that that’s changed.I know three women who have had to go through a second course of chemo treatments, and all three have had to fight long and hard for the past two or three months for covered care. Not right. We need protection against that sort of evil, money-grubbing insurance companies that took advantage of people.Obamacare covered some and took from others. Instead of fixing what was wrong, they ruined it for those who were paying for it.—Josephine DeFrancoThe most insidious thing for most of us isn’t premiums or rationed care, but deductibles. Those of us paying about $6,000 per year in premiums also have to pay $6,000 out of pocket before the insurance pays for anything besides a cursory once-a-year checkup. We have it, but can’t afford to use it.—Greg HawkinsIt comes down to understanding insurance before Obamacare and after Obamacare was put into place.First of all, no one seems to know what Obamacare covers, including agencies that sell health insurance. Basically, you make a certain yearly salary to qualify for a government subsidy to help cover your insurance premium. Make less, you sign up for Medicaid. If you are a young women with no children, you do not qualify.Therefore if you fall through the cracks you have no insurance. Or, in our case, we pay almost $400 a month for our 27-year-old daughter’s insurance. You can’t go to other states for treatment, or you go through major red tape and it costs you more.I can go on and on. My advice: Stop complaining and educate yourself about health insurance. Quite honestly, we were doing just fine before Obama thought the government needed to be in the health care business.—Mary Helen Jeffcoat",http://dailysignal.com/2017/07/23/we-hear-you/,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,Unrelated,,4 Ways Big Hospitals Screwed You Through Obamacare,"The health-care sector seems to believe they have a God-given right to consume at least one-sixth of the economy (and growing).As Republicans prepare legislation to repeal Obamacare, the health care industrial complex has raised a host of concerns. Notably, two hospital associations recently released a report highlighting the supposed negative implications of the reconciliation bill Congress passed, and President Obama vetoed, late last year.While the hospitals allege that repealing Obamacare would decimate their industry, their report cleverly omits four inconvenient truths.In August 2010 at an American Enterprise Institute forum, then-Medicare actuary Rick Foster engaged in a discussion with Chip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, about the effects of Obamacare. The non-partisan actuary asked Kahn a simple question: Why did his industry agree to a series of so-called productivity adjustments, which lower hospitals’ Medicare reimbursement rates every year forever, in exchange for a one-time increase in their number of insured patients?Kahn gave a simple, yet cynical, reply: “You could say, did you make a bad deal, and fortunately, I don’t think I’ll probably be working after 2020 [Laughter.]….I’m glad my contract only goes another six years. [Laughter.]”Fast-forward those six years to earlier this fall, when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed the effects of various Obamacare provisions on hospital margins. The report concluded that even under the best-case scenario—in which hospitals achieve a level of efficiency non-partisan experts doubt they can reach—the revenue from Obamacare’s coverage expansions will barely offset the negative effects of the productivity adjustments. Under the worst-case scenario, more than half of hospitals could become unprofitable by 2025, and the entire industry could face negative profit margins.Responding to the CBO report, the Federation of American Hospitals put out a statement from none other than Chip Kahn, wailing that “Medicare cuts are taking a punishing toll on the hospitals that serve all of us.” Translation: “Save me from my own stupidity—and the bad deal I cut six years ago!”Kahn knew full well in August 2010 that Obamacare would eventually decimate his industry, through the cumulative effect of year-over-year reductions in Medicare payments. The laughter during his comments demonstrates Kahn thought it was one big joke. He and his colleagues cynically calculated first that they wouldn’t be around when those payment reductions really started to bite; and second that Congress would bail the hospitals out of their own bad deal—essentially, that hospitals are “too big to fail.”Last year’s reconciliation bill essentially undid the fiscal legerdemain that allowed Obamacare to pass in the first place. In the original 2010 legislation, Democrats used savings from Medicare both to improve the solvency of Medicare (at least on paper) and to fund the new entitlements.The reconciliation bill would have repealed the new entitlements, and—in a truly novel concept—used Obamacare’s Medicare savings to…save Medicare. Instead, the hospital industry wants to continue the budget gimmickry that allows Medicare money to be spent twice and used for other projects.Last year, researchers from MIT released a major paper using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment—in which winners of a random lottery won the right to Medicaid benefits, while others did not—to calculate the utility of Medicaid coverage. The study found that most beneficiaries valued their coverage at between 20 and 40 cents on the dollar. In other words, if given the choice between Medicaid coverage valued at $3,000 and cash in the amount of $1,500, most beneficiaries would take the cash.In theory, individuals receiving cash contributions in lieu of Medicaid coverage could improve their health in all sorts of ways—buy healthier food, obtain transportation to a higher-paying job, move to a better apartment closer to parks and recreation. But who would object to giving patients cash to improve their health instead of insurance? You guessed it: Hospitals.Hospitals view Medicaid as their entitlement, not their patients’. That’s why hospitals have worked so hard for Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. It’s also why they wouldn’t support diverting money from coverage into other programs (e.g., education, housing, nutrition, etc.) that could actually improve patients’ health more than insurance, which has been demonstrated not to improve physical health outcomes.Hospitals will claim that repealing Obamacare will cost industry jobs, just as they pushed for states to expand Medicaid as a way to create jobs. But economic experts on both sides of the aisle find this argument frivolous at best. As Zeke Emanuel, a former Obama administration official, has noted: “Health care is about keeping people healthy or fixing them up when they get sick. It is not a jobs program.”Likewise, conservative economist Katherine Baicker has questioned “The Health Care Jobs Fallacy.” All spending will create jobs, one way or another. After all, if you’re looking to keep people employed, paying them to dig ditches and fill them in again will do the trick. But Baicker notes that it’s a far different thing to argue that health care represents the best and most efficient use of resources—better than, say, building roads and bridges, lowering taxes, or even repaying the deficit.The health-care sector seems to believe they have a God-given right to consume at least one-sixth of the economy (and growing). Rebutting hospitals’ argument—that they, and only they, can create jobs—might represent the first step in lowering health costs, which would help non-health sectors of the economy grow more quickly.",http://thefederalist.com/2017/01/10/4-ways-big-hospitals-screwed-obamacare/,
Obamacare is one big fat VA system.,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/,False,Unrelated,Unrelated,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,,"The Senate GOP's New Health Care Bill Is Just Obamacare, But Less Of It","When congressional Republicans began drafting health care legislation at the beginning of the year, critics worried that the result would not be the repeal and replace of Obamacare that the GOP had long promised. Instead, they warned, the Republican party was on track to produce something more aptly understood as Obamacare lite—a watered down version of the law that is already in place.Partly this was for procedural reasons: Reconciliation, the budget maneuver which Republicans are relying on to pass a bill in the Senate with a simple majority vote, presents some procedural barriers to full repeal. But those worries also stemmed from long-simmering concerns that, despite having spent seven years campaigning on replacing the health care law, Republicans had developed no substantive health policy goals of their own.This morning, after weeks of unusual secrecy, the Senate has finally released a draft version of the bill, dubbed the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. In the hours before the bill was made public, details began to leak, and a clear picture of the legislation has emerged. Although Senate Republicans had initially indicated that they would scrap the House bill and start from scratch, the Senate plan looks more than a little like its House counterpart, which kept much of Obamacare's structure in place. But even more tellingly, the Senate plan looks even closer to the health care law that is already on the books.In other words, it is exactly what critics predicted: a bill that, at least in the near term, retains weakened versions of nearly all of Obamacare's core features while fixing few if any of the problems that Republicans say they want to fix. It is Obamacare lite—the health law that Republicans claim to oppose, but less of it. It represents a total failure of Republican policy imagination.To understand the Senate plan, it helps to recall Obamacare's underlying framework. The centerpiece of the law was a reform of the individual market, intended to give those who do not get coverage through work or a federal program access to subsidized, regulated coverage. The law created a new federal subsidy, based on income, for lower- and middle-income households to purchase health insurance. It set up federal rules requiring insurers to sell to all comers while limiting their ability to charge based on health history. It mandated that all individuals obtain health coverage or pay a tax penalty. And it erected a system of government-run health insurance exchanges on which consumers could purchase subsidized, regulated individual market coverage.Those exchanges have never been fully stable as either business or policy propositions. Premiums have marched steadily upwards; last year, the price of a typical plan rose by 22 percent, and early reports show large spikes coming this year as well. The non-profit health insurance organizations that Obamacare funded have mostly shut down. Large, for-profit health insurers, meanwhile, have lost money and either scaled back their participation or dropped out entirely.Republicans have repeatedly criticized these marketplaces for being expensive and unstable. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who spearheaded the drafting of this bill, likes to say, Obamacare is collapsing around us.Yet even more than the House plan, the Senate plan retains the essential structure of Obamacare's individual market reforms. It would likely result in fewer people being covered, and it would not stop the destabilization of the market.Like the House plan, the Senate plan retains Obamacare's major insurance regulations, including the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions, at the federal level. Unlike the House plan, it does not allow states to apply for a waiver to opt out of those rules. It also eliminates Obamacare's health insurance mandate.Every state that has attempted this combination of coverage regulations without a mandate has seen a swift meltdown in the individual market. There is every reason to expect that the same would happen under the Senate plan, especially since Obamacare's exchanges were struggling with a too-small, too-sick enrollee pool even with the mandate in place.The Senate bill attempts to manage this instability by buying off health insurance companies with payments that Republicans previously argued were illegal and should be stopped.The way it does this is by authorizing additional payments known as cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies to insurers through 2019. It also authorizes the back payment of any CSR subsidies that insurers have not recieved. On this front, it is actually an expansion of Obamacare, and it is a revealing sign of the shallowness of Republican thinking on health care policy.The Obama administration initially requested congressional authorization to make the CSR payments, which are called for in Obamacare, but not explicitly appropriated. The House did not provide it. The administration then paid them anyway, believing that the exchanges would collapse without them. In response, House Republicans sued, arguing that only Congress has the power to appropriate funds. A federal judge agreed that the Obama administration was violating the constitutional separation of powers. The Trump administration has continued making the payments while threatening to withhold them, adding to the uncertainty for insurers operating in the exchanges.Now Senate Republicans are proposing to explicitly authorize those payments for the first time. That means they are proposing to explicitly authorize and continue the very policy their House colleagues took the previous administration to court for pursuing. It amounts to an expansion of Obamacare, and while it may reduce uncertainty in some markets, it is unlikely to halt premium increases or fully stabilize the exchanges, which were degrading even before Trump threatened to withhold the payments. Moreover, it is an admission that Republicans do not believe they can meaningfully improve on the Obama administration's implementation of the law.That same inability to move beyond the core structure of Obamacare is also apparent in the design of the Senate plan's insurance subsidies.The House version of the AHCA provided subsidies based on age. But the Senate version relies on income-based subsidies, just like Obamacare—but a little less generous. Currently, Obamacare provides subsidies for individual up to 400 percent of the poverty line, or about $98,000 a year for a family of four. Starting in 2020, the Senate bill would ratchet that back to 350 percent of the poverty line, or about $86,000 for the same family. In addition, reports indicate that the subsidies are pegged to lower-cost plans, which means the subsidies will be smaller, and will likely lead to more plans with high deductibles.Taken on its own terms, this scheme undercuts the GOP's complaints that Obamacare hurts the middle class. In addition to the higher deductibles, it creates a subsidy cliff for middle-class families purchasing health insurance on the individual market. Those who earn slightly too much to qualify for a subsidy would have to pay full price for health coverage that is increasingly expensive.More generally, it represents a failure to think beyond the confines of the law that is already in place. At a fundamental level, the Senate plan accepts Obamacare's premises about the nature of health insurance and the individual market. It works from the assumption that the only way to make expensive health insurance cheaper is to subsidize it through the federal government. It is a plan that subsidizes, and therefore disguises, unaffordability, rather than attempting to bring down costs directly.Perhaps the Senate bill's biggest departure from Obamacare is the way it would handle Medicaid. Like the House bill, the Senate plan would slowly roll back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion over a period of years, converting Medicaid into a per-capita system in which federal matching funds are allocated on a per-person basis. It would delay the start of the phase out until 2021, scaling back funding for expansion enrollees a little more each year. In addition, starting in 2025, it would place a stricter cap on the growth of Medicaid spending than the House bill, limiting it to general inflation rather than medical inflation. In the long term, then, the Senate bill's Medicaid cuts would be much deeper.But even this suggests a resistance to act outside of the parameters already set by Obamacare. Not only is the phase-out slow, but the delays mean that it is susceptible to political reversals. As conservative health policy analyst Chris Jacobs wrote recently, any Medicaid rollback that is delayed until after 2020 essentially requires a Republican president to go into effect. The growth cap, meanwhile, is unlikely to happen unless a Republican wins the White House in 2024. The Medicaid provisions, like much of the bill, appear designed to frustrate nearly everyone. Backers of the expansion oppose the cuts, while critics will worry that they won't happen at all.The Medicaid provisions—and in particular the altered growth cap—may be best understood as budget gimmicks. On paper, the rollback reduces federal spending, generating estimates of budget savings inside the 10 year window that the Congressional Budget Office uses to score legislation. Those budget savings are necessary for Republicans to use the reconciliation process, but they assume that in the future, Congress will not reverse course. Given that many Republicans from Medicaid expansion states are wary of the rollback, and Democrats universally oppose it, this is far from certain.Indeed, one of the most striking features of the Senate plan is how many of its major provisions are delayed for years. The CSR subsidies that are now being paid on a month-to-month basis by the Trump administration would continue through 2019. The adjustments to the individual market subsidies would not start until 2020. The Medicaid expansion rollback also would not begin until 2021, and the growth cap would not kick in until 2025.These delays mean that the current high levels of political uncertainty surrounding Obamacare and the individual market would last for years, through the next two elections and beyond. It is not too hard to imagine some or all of these provisions being delayed further, or even becoming kicked down the road on a semi-permanent basis, as the tweak to physician Medicare reimbursement known as the doc fix was for more than a decade. That, in turn, could result in a health care system that is wracked by permanent instability and uncertainty—one that is always about to change, according to the law, but never or rarely does.That sort of environment would satisfy almost no one. It would cause headaches for both providers and patients, while making product policy reforms even more difficult, as lawmakers constantly debate changes scheduled to go into effect rather than improvements they would like to see. It would prolong and exacerbate the political squabbling over health care rather than settle it.For Republicans, this might be the notable failure to think beyond the terms set by Obamacare. It means that Senate bill not only won't be Obamacare repeal, it might not even be Obamacare lite. Instead, it might be Obamacare lite—later. And later could easily turn out to be never.",http://reason.com/blog/2017/06/22/the-senate-gops-new-health-care-bill-is,

He’s proposed the largest tax increase in mankind’s history, not just our own country’s history.The next day Bush repeated the basic claim in a : Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.Seems like something worth fact-checking.A spokesman for Bush told us that the former Florida governor was referring to Trump’s to on the rich.Trump, who at the time was considering a run for president under the Reform Party, proposed a one-time tax on individuals and trusts with a worth of $10 million or more. Trump said the one-time tax of 14.25 percent would raise $5.7 trillion and wipe out the debt. Trump said if the rich were having trouble liquidating their assets they could pay off their tax over 10 years.The New York Daily News featured a photograph of Trump with the words, SOAK THE RICH.Experts at the time bashed Trump’s plan as economically and politically unviable.I don't think the plan makes much economic sense, said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute told the New York Times in 1999. The fact is that most people's wealth that has been built up over 10, 20 or 50 years is wealth that has already been taxed.Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in 1999 said of Trump’s plan at the time, The lunacy of this idea is almost indescribable. He raised concerns about the economic consequences including that households would shift assets overseas to try to avoid confiscation.Trump calculated that 1 percent of Americans would pay the Trump tax. He proposed that half the savings would go toward middle-class tax cuts and the other half for Social Security.A spokeswoman for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Hope Hicks, wouldn’t tell us if Trump still supports that plan and said that he will release his current tax plan later in September.But in 2011, talk show host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he still supported that tax, and Trump said it was no longer viable.Well, at a time, it would have paid off the deficit. I mean, you wouldn't have a deficit, at that time, Trump said (though he confused debt and deficit). Unfortunately, the world has changed, today you can't do it. Today, and I'm very strongly against tax increases. And the reason I'm-So, you're no longer for that tax? Stephanopoulos asked.No, no. I'm no longer for that tax, no, Trump said.Many tax experts told us that indeed Trump’s plan would have been record-breaking in terms of revenue, but they said it was never going to happen and lacked major details.It certainly would have been the biggest ever simply because of its sheer size -- it was trillions of dollars, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. However, it’s a totally crazy idea. ...  I don't think anybody was taking it seriously -- it was Donald Trump being Donald Trump.The United States’ gross domestic product in 1999 was $9.7 trillion, so if Trump’s tax had raised $5.7 trillion, that would have been 59 percent of GDP, said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.Federal tax hikes typically are no more than 1 percent of GDP, Edwards said.The Bush 1990 hike and Clinton 1993 hike were less than 1 percent of GDP over 5 years —  whereas Trump’s tax would have been 59 percent one time in one year, Edwards said.PolitiFact previously has looked into the largest tax increases as a percentage of GDP. Topping the list from 1940-2006 was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was about 5 percent of GDP.Richard Phillips, an expert at the Citizens for Tax Justice research group, which aims to require the wealthy to pay their fair share, said that Trump’s one-time tax proposal can’t be compared to conventional tax reform, which typically refers to taxes collected annually.His estimate was based on a back of the envelope calculation of total wealth of individuals with over $10 million in assets multiplied by the 14.25 percent rate, he said. There are very real questions as to whether you could plausibly tax all forms of wealth and whether wealthy individuals would be able to take action to shield large swaths of their wealth from taxation.Additionally, Trump proposed repealing the estate tax and enacting other tax cuts using the revenue that the federal government would save by no longer paying interest on the national debt. It’s not clear how much those tax cuts would have cost and how much of the tax they would offset over time, Phillips said.Bush said, Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.Yes, in 1999, Trump proposed a historically large one-time tax increase.

This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country.But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.)The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years.So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year.That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever.The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale.Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger.At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill.And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP:By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP.The group added in a blog post that if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.No formulation of the current proposal is close to that.Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it’s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history, said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts.Trump said the GOP tax plan he is supporting is the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.Even the most expansive estimate for the current proposal’s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Barring a reversal by Congress, the courts or administration policy, the move probably will drive up costs substantially for many in the health exchanges, send insurers fleeing from the already troubled marketplace, or both. Trump makes no secret of his wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But he had been casting a lifeline to those exchanges by making the payments month to month. Now he’s yanked that back.Trump also directed his administration to rewrite federal rules to ease the way for “association health plans” that could offer cheaper coverage with fewer protections than are guaranteed in the law’s health plans. That, too, potentially undermines the 2010 law. Furthermore, his administration said before this week that it is sharply cutting programs that promote health insurance enrollment under the law for next year.Trump: “I’m giving the largest tax cuts in the history of this country.” — comments Tuesday after meeting Henry Kissinger.The Facts: His tax plan is, at most, fifth largest in its estimated cost, says Marc Goldwein of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It could end up being even lower on the ladder historically.The estimated cost of the tax plan has dropped by half or more since the spring, when only the contours were known. In an analysis in April, Goldwein’s group found that the $5.5 trillion plan that was then expected would have been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product, behind President Ronald Reagan’s package in 1981 and tax cuts enacted in 1945 to phase out revenue generated for World War II. But, citing estimated costs of $1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion for Trump’s plan now, Goldwein said several other historically significant tax cuts also would surpass Trump’s: from 2013 and 1964.Trump: “Since the election on November 8th, I’ve increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe.” — comparing rising values with the national debt, in a speech Wednesday to truckers in Pennsylvania.The Facts: Trump’s suggestion that his election is the solitary explanation for higher stock and home prices does not reflect how the economy works. Trump’s election and the promise of a tax overhaul certainly helped the stock market at first. But recent gains also reflect better global growth and other factors that are beyond the president’s control.Most Americans’ primary asset is their home, and there is little evidence that home values are rising because of Trump’s presidency. Much of the increase in home values reflects a dwindling supply of properties on the market relative to demand from would-be buyers. People’s net worth has improved because mortgage debt is being repaid, increasing the equity they have in their homes.Meantime, the International Monetary Fund expects world economic growth will reach a six-year high this year. Three-quarters of the globe is experiencing growth, the first synchronized worldwide upswing in a decade. That’s a big boost for U.S. companies that earn much of their money overseas, and a lift for the U.S. stock market.Also, people’s rising stock and home values do not mean a paying down of the federal government’ debt.Trump: “When it comes to the business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations. Our rate is the least competitive rate. We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world. How foolish is this?” — Pennsylvania speech.The Facts: This is a misleading picture and one he paints continually. The U.S. does have the highest statutory corporate tax rate, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Other countries with lower corporate taxes also charge a separate tax on consumption, known as a Value Added Tax, that lets them keep corporate rates lower. The overall tax burden in the United States is among the lowest in the developed world.Trump: “We are nearly doubling the amount of income that is based at the zero bracket.” Democrats are “not telling you the truth, because they pretend there isn’t a zero rate. And there is, and it’s expanding very substantially under my plan.” — Pennsylvania speech.The Facts: Some people who accept that statement at face value are bound to get sticker shock at tax time, if his plan is adopted.With the “zero” tax rate, Trump is talking about his proposed doubling of the standard deduction. While the higher standard deduction would exclude the first $24,000 in family earnings from taxes, the plan would also get rid of the personal exemption. The loss of the exemption would expose some families—particularly larger ones—to higher taxes than the doubling of the standard deduction.Trump: “The Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water.” — remarks Friday criticizing Iran’s behavior while stopping short of pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement.The Facts: Iran is meeting all its obligations under the deal that suspended its nuclear program in return for eased international sanctions, according to International Atomic Energy Agency investigators. They did note some minor violations that were quickly corrected.Trump is right that Iran exceeded the limit on heavy water in its possession on two occasions. Both times international inspectors were able to see that Iran made arrangements to ship the excess out of the country so that Tehran could come back into compliance.Supporters of the deal argue that this shows the agreement works. Opponents say that because Iran sells the surplus on the open market, it is therefore being rewarded for violating the deal.Trump and other critics of the agreement point in particular to Iran’s continuing missile tests, which may or may not defy the U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrined the deal. But those tests do not violate the deal itself.Trump: “I will tell you, I left Texas and I left Florida, and I left Louisiana, and I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands. These are people that are incredible people.” — speech to religious conservatives Friday.The Facts: He met the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kenneth Mapp, not a president. It’s not a country so it doesn’t have a president. He correctly referred to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as territories. At a congressional hearing a day earlier, Energy Secretary Rick Perry called Puerto Rico “a country that already had its challenges before the storm,” and apologized when told of the flub.Trump: “I don’t believe in undercutting people.” — comments to the press Tuesday, when asked about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.The Facts: If a boss’s public disparagement of those who work for him counts as undercutting, Trump undercuts.He used Twitter to undercut Tillerson’s diplomatic outreach to North Korea (“save your energy, Rex”), then suggested he’s got a higher IQ than his chief diplomat. This, after NBC News reported that Tillerson had described Trump as a “moron.”Trump also used Twitter and other forums in the summer to humiliate his “very weak” and “beleaguered” attorney general, Jeff Sessions.If publicly disparaging political associates counts as undercutting, too, the list is very long.He barked at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to “get back to work” after the collapse of an effort to repeal the health law; said Republican senators “look like fools”; and branded Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., “Liddle’ Bob Corker” after the senator slammed him on multiple fronts.Consciously or not, Trump’s energy-saving advice to Tillerson and his comment on Corker’s height recalled the taunts he directed against his 2016 Republican primary rivals, “low energy” Jeb Bush and “Little Marco” Rubio, the Florida senator.Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders argued it’s impossible for a president to undercut his Cabinet because “the president is the leader of the Cabinet. He sets the tone, he sets the agenda.”Trump: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that’s what I am dealing with!” — tweet Tuesday.The Facts: The Times wasn’t sneaky in recording the interview. Corker asked that he be recorded, mentioning that his aides were also on the line: “I know they’re recording it, and I hope you are, too,” he told his interviewer. He also said: “I understand we’re on the record.” Corker said in the interview that Trump risked putting the U.S. on a path to world war and treated his office like a reality TV show.Trump: “So GDP last quarter was 3.1%. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.” — interview with Forbes magazine.The Facts: Yes, Obama did, repeatedly. Growth topped 3% in eight quarters during Obama’s presidency.When Forbes pointed out that Obama had reached that benchmark, Trump amended his claim: “He never hit it on a yearly basis.”That’s true. The economy never grew by more than 3% for a full calendar year under Obama. That hasn’t happened since 2005. It is unlikely to happen this year, either.Trump: “I’ve had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that’s ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I’m not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I’m talking about bills.” — Forbes interview.The Facts: He’s signed little of consequence into law, a thin record all the more striking because of the Republican majority in the House and Senate. His record pales not just next to Franklin Roosevelt’s but with Obama’s and others. Trump, like his predecessors, has signed a lot of routine legislation, naming federal buildings after people and the like. He’s also signed emergency hurricane aid into law.But the only far-reaching bill he’s signed is one he didn’t like but went along with, tightening sanctions on Russia and Iran. His promised repeal and replacement of Obama’s health care law has yet to materialize after twice failing in Congress. His proposed tax overhaul is in play, not in place, and the big-ticket infrastructure initiative he promised hasn’t come to Congress.Trump: “Now, we’re going to have to do something with Obamacare because it’s failing. Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116% increase in his premiums, but that’s what’s happening.” — after meeting Kissinger on Tuesday.The Facts: Kissinger is going to be OK. The 94-year-old former secretary of state and national security adviser, chairman of his own international consulting firm and prolific author, is surely not bothered by rising premiums. People on Medicare can’t sign up for the insurance exchanges anyway.But what to make of Trump’s suggestion that people in the exchanges are seeing premiums rise 116%? That comes from one state, Arizona, where unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark plan under Obama’s law increased 116% this year, according to an earlier government estimate. That cost, however, could be reduced significantly with subsidies available to low- and moderate-income people.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: “Sen. Corker worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal.” — briefing Tuesday.Trump tweet Oct. 8: “He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!”The Facts: Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had no role in crafting the 2015 international agreement forged by the U.S. and other world powers to constrain Iran’s ability to build a nuclear arsenal. Corker actually was a vocal opponent of the accord and argued Obama should have made the international pact a treaty subject to approval by the Senate.When Obama didn’t do that, Corker helped fellow senators write legislation that subjected the accord to periodic congressional review. The legislation would have stopped the deal from moving forward if that effort got enough votes. It didn’t. In any event, the ultimate decision to bring the deal into effect was made by Obama, not Congress.",http://fortune.com/2017/10/16/fact-check-donald-trump-tax-cuts/,
Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,True,True,True,True,True,"In classic Trump fashion, the plan was big and bold. If enacted, Trump's plan would have been biggest tax hike, in total raw dollars, in history. In a word, it would have been huge. ",Trump Once Proposed the Biggest Tax Hike Ever,"Donald Trump takes a lot of flak for failing to offer specific policy proposals, but there was a time when he offered a very specific tax plan -- one that raised taxes on the wealthy so much it might have made Bernie Sanders blush. In classic Trump fashion, the plan was big and bold. If enacted, Trump's plan would have been biggest tax hike, in total raw dollars, in history. In a word, it would have been huge. The year was 1999 and Trump was toying with the idea of running for President as a third party candidate. The idea, which Trump says he no longer supports, was to impose a one-time tax of 14.25 percent on every American worth more than $10 million and raise exactly enough money to pay off the debt. Trump himself would have had to pay more than $700 million. But he didn't care. He calculated his plan would erase the entire national debt and save the government millions in interest payments, allowing tax cuts for everybody else. Here's how Trump described the plan on ""Good Morning America"" on Nov. 10, 1999: ""Well, basically, this would be a one-time tax, 14.25 percent against people with a net worth of over 10 million,"" Trump said. ""It would pay off in its entirety the national debt of $5.7 trillion, and you'd save $200 billion a year. So taxes for the middle class would go way down, the estate and inheritance tax totally wiped out, and the Social Security system would be saved."" In a screaming front page headline that same day, the New York Daily News featured a photograph of Mr. Trump with the words, “SOAK THE RICH: Trump's way-out plan to end nat'l debt...Proposes one-shot $5.7 trillion tax on the super-wealthy.” PHOTO: Donald Trump appears on the cover of the New York Daily News on Nov. 10, 1999.New York Daily News Donald Trump appears on the cover of the New York Daily News on Nov. 10, 1999. Trump also wrote about the plan in his 2000 book ""The America We Deserve"" as ""bold, radical, realistic, and doable."" “Some will say that my plan is unfair to the extremely wealthy,"" Trump wrote. ""I say it is only reasonable to shift the burden to those most able to pay.” He portrayed tax hikes on the rich as a patriotic. “Most of the truly wealthy people I know – and I know many – have doubled their net worth in the last few years,"" Trump wrote. ""Yes, I believe we have an obligation to pay. Taxes represent the cost of freedom and its defense. It is a small price.” In a precursor to the Occupy Wall Street movement, Trump argued that that soaking the Top 1 percent is only fair. “The rich will scream,"" Trump wrote. ""Only the top 1 percent of people – those with a net worth of $10 million or more – would be affected by my plan. The other 99 percent would get deep reductions in their federal income taxes.” PHOTO: Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump speaks after arriving at the airport for a visit to the U.S. Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, July 23, 2015. LM Otero/AP Photo Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump speaks after arriving at the airport for a visit to the U.S. Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, July 23, 2015. more + In the 1999 interview, Trump was asked about those who would not have the cash to pay the tax because their wealth is tied up in investments such as real estate or stocks. ""It's a very fair question and very good question that's been thought of in great detail. Some people would be able to sell things off, easily pay the tax,"" Trump said. ""They sell off assets, you'd sell off assets."" Impractical? The former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who is less than 5 feet tall, told ""Good Morning America"" immediately after Trump's 1999 interview that the plan would have as much as chance of passing Congress as he would getting recruited to play basketball for the New York Knicks. Trump acknowledged it would be tough to pass -- for anybody except for him. ""If I were president, it would be passed. I think if somebody else is president, it probably can't be,"" he said in the ""Good Morning America"" interview. ""This is a tax paid by 1 percent, but the 1 percent will be very big beneficiaries with what's going to happen and the positive forces that would take place in the economy."" During the course of several interviews on the plan, Trump added more details. The tax would be paid over time: the wealthy could pay the tax in installments over the course of 10 years, giving them time to sell off assets to pay the tax. With the money saved by eliminating interest payments on the debt, he would eliminate the estate tax and cut income taxes on everybody across-the-board. In an interview on ""Hardball"" with Chris Matthews one week later, on Nov. 18, 1999, Trump predicted the plan would be a boon to everybody, especially those who paid the big tax. ""The economy would boom. We'd have no debt,"" Trump said. ""Hey, I know about debt probably as much as anybody. I've had too much, and I've had too little. And you know what? Too little is much better, believe me."" A decade later, Trump backed away from his plan. In another ""GMA"" interview in 2011, he explained that the economy had changed, making the plan no longer viable. ""Well, at that time, it would have paid off the deficit. I mean, you wouldn't have a deficit at that time,"" he told George Stephanopoulos. ""Unfortunately, the world has changed. Today, you can't do it. Today, and I'm very strongly against tax increases."" Most recently, Trump has said his plan was about paying ""as little as possible"" in taxes. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, Trump said he ""hates the way our government spends our taxes. I hate the way they waste our money. Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste and abuse."" Trump remains against tax increases, and his campaign promises more specifics on his tax plan soon.",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-proposed-biggest-tax-hike/story?id=32926722,
Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,False,False,False,True,Unrelated,,Obama's tax cut was bigger than what Trump is proposing,"What? Barack Obama cut taxes when he was president?If you’re an Obama critic, you might think President Donald Trump’s predecessor in the White House only raised taxes during his eight years in office. But right after getting re-elected in 2012, Obama signed a law called the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which extended a bunch of tax cuts that were due to expire. That law cost the U.S. Treasury about $321 billion per year, or about 1.8% of GDP. The other way of looking at it, of course, is that taxpayers kept $321 billion more of their own money than they would have otherwise.Trump has promised “the biggest tax cut in U.S. history,” which is more Trumpian overstatement than usual.  The cuts Trump has outlined would amount to $190 billion at the most, or a bit more than 1% of GDP, and they’ll probably come in way below that once Congressional negotiations are complete. As outlined, the Trump cuts would only be the eighth largest, as a percentage of GDP, in the last 100 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.If you don’t remember the Obama tax cuts, there’s a reason. Obama didn’t propose massive tax cuts, and sign his own plan into law. What he did was sign a law that made permanent tax cuts his predecessor, George W. Bush, had put into place. So in a way, Obama merely ratified tax cuts enacted by another president, largely because he had no choice — most consumers would have endured major tax increases had Obama refused to extend the cuts. But the law Obama signed offers an important lesson that’s relevant today, with Congress poised once again to cut taxes and push the national debt higher.The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 essentially backed Obama into a corner, because they were temporary, with many due to expire at the end of 2012. Temporary tax cuts are a gimmick that lowers the nominal amount of revenue lost, since in theory, they expire at some point in the future and lost revenue is restored. But by letting such tax cuts expire, a future president would be foisting a giant tax increase on voters who have adjusted their budgets to comport with current reality, not a theoretical future. Everybody in Washington knows there’s really no such thing as a temporary tax cut, because no future president will let them lapse, at least not on the middle class. The only thing that’s temporary is the fake budget math that understates how much tax cuts add to the national debt.Republicans are under pressure to once again make some of their upcoming tax cuts temporary, to lower the overall price tag and comply with arcane Senate rules that put a cap on the amount a piece of legislation can add to the debt, if it’s to pass with a bare majority of 51 votes. They should consider the ultimate result of the cuts that were due to expire in 2012. The battle over what to do about those cuts generated the “fiscal cliff” drama that unnerved financial markets and eventually added trillions more to the national debt. Markets settled down once Washington steered away from the fiscal cliff, but the national debt went up and up. Here’s what that ghastly trend line looks like:Trump, in fact, should stop talking about a tax cut of unprecedented size, because we don’t need one. The economy might not be soaring, but it’s growing steadily, job growth is strong and the stock market is on a prolonged tear. The biggest tax cut of the last century was Ronald Reagan’s in 1981, which came at a more appropriate time. Back then, the economy was in the midst of back-to-back recessions, consumers were shell-shocked by double-digit interest rates, and super-high income-tax rates were out of whack, anyway. No such conditions apply today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamas-tax-cut-bigger-trump-proposing-175123554.html,
Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,---,True,Can not judge,True,Can not judge,,"The GOP Plan Is the Biggest Tax Increase in American History, By Far","moving its way through Congress is routinely referred to as a $1.5 trillion tax cut. And, in some ways, that’s true: on net, it would reduce the amount of taxes collected by the federal treasury by about $1.5 trillion over 10 years.But that figure masks the eye-popping scale and audacity of the GOP’s rushed restructuring of the economy. Most immediately, the plan will take a large chunk out of state and local revenue that isn’t factored into that total. But more broadly, the bill cuts taxes by a full $6 trillion over a decade.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Friday afternoon Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the plan, which gets referred to as only a $1.5 trillion cut because it raises $4.5 trillion in taxes elsewhere. But the key question is who gets a tax hike and who gets a tax cut. Put simply, the bulk of the tax cut is going toward the rich, while the tax increases go to everybody else.And so the bill, properly described, is two things: the largest tax cut — and also the biggest tax increase — in American history.Republicans have spent years describing the Affordable Care Act as the largest tax increase in U.S. history, ignoring the fact that the tax increases were balanced out by subsidies to pay for health coverage. In that respect, the ACA was a significant transfer of wealth from the top to the middle and bottom, which earned it the ire of the GOP. But all told, it raised less than $1 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for all that. The relative stinginess, in fact, is what fueled its unpopularity, as premiums and deductibles remained too high. But what Republicans lambasted as a historic tax hike represents just one-fifth of the tax increase of the new GOP bill.The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 80 percent of the benefit of the tax plan will go to the top 1 percent, who will enjoy the following elements of the tax cut:A full $1.5 trillion alone is going to slash the corporate tax rate. CEOs have said repeatedly they plan to pocket that money rather than invest it or give workers higher wages.The alternative minimum tax, paid almost exclusively by the rich, is also eliminated. That’s a $700 billion giveaway.Another $150 billion goes to repealing the estate tax, which currently exempts the first $11 million of the deceased’s estate, so nobody even remotely middle class pays it. The repeal benefits so few people you can practically list them out.More than $200 billion in cuts goes to a provision that allows a greater deduction for dividends on foreign earnings. That’s not for you.Roughly $600 billion goes to reducing taxes on “pass-throughs” and other businesses not set up as corporations, which law firms, lobby shops, and doctors’ offices often benefit from. Poor and middle-class people do not tend to set themselves up as pass-throughs.Under current law, many tax credits phase out at low-income thresholds. The GOP plan changes that by raising the threshold so richer people can also claim the credit. That provision alone is, by definition, a $200 billion tax cut for the wealthy.Individual and family tax rates are cut by about $1 trillion, and some regular people will indeed see some of that money as a tax cut — but not much. As the New York Times noted, by 2027, people making between $40,000 and $50,000 would see a combined increase of $5.3 billion in taxes. Where would that money go? Folks earning more than $1 million would see their taxes collectively cut by $5.8 billion a year.The list above brings the total well close to $5 trillion in tax cuts almost exclusively for the wealthy. The last major element of the bill, the doubling of the standard deduction, would benefit a broader range of people, but it comes at the expense of states, cities, and towns.While Obamacare was a transfer of wealth from the top to the bottom, this bill sends money back the other way.Even some of the ways the plan “raises” taxes on the rich wind up being a tax cut. Some $300 billion is raised by allowing companies who stashed profits offshore to repatriate it at a much lower rate. That repatriated cash will go straight to dividends for shareholders and stock buybacks — but it gets counted as a tax increase, which then allows the GOP to give an equal $300 billion cut on the other side of the ledger. It’s neat how that works.The bill raises $1.6 trillion by repealing the personal exemption everybody gets on their tax returns. Getting rid of it across the board is extraordinarily regressive, since it gives the same benefit to the likes of Jared Kushner as it gives to people who have much less money than he does, so they’re hit much harder.It raises another $1.3 trillion by going after deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, interest on student loans, medical expenses, teachers’ out-of-pocket expenses for paper and pencils for students, and a bunch of other nickel-and-diming of the middle class. No change drawer in the car, couch cushion, or plastic piggy bank is going untouched in the hunt for money to pay for the tax cut.The plan gradually raises $128 billion in taxes by changing the way inflation is tabulated, so that your taxes slowly creep up over the years as the brackets come down.And then, of course, the plan adds about $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. That gets you most of the way to $6 trillion, with a handful of smaller tax hikes thrown in, some of which won’t obviously hurt the middle class. The domestic production deduction, a $96 billion boondoggle, is repealed, for instance, and $54 billion is saved by ending the credit for testing cures for rare diseases.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., went on NPR on Friday morning to try to defend the largest tax hike in American history.“What does it say that — in practice according to independent analyses, I mean you do have winners and losers, not everybody gains, businesses gain, people with large estates to leave to their heirs gain, high-income people gain — but a lot of middle-income people do not gain in terms of money,” NPR’s Steve Inskeep said.“I disagree with that. The average tax cut for a middle-class family is going to be $1,182,” Ryan responded.Inskeep pushed back. “Lily Batchelder of New York University took some numbers from the Joint Committee of Taxation, bipartisan part of Congress as you know very well, and concluded that something like 100 million households in this country under the House bill, and even more under the Senate bill, would either get no tax cut or would get a tax increase,” Inskeep said. “Does that sound right to you?”It didn’t sound right to Ryan.“No, it doesn’t sound right unless it’s a person that’s not paying taxes already,” he said. “I think some people are cherry picking statistics.”Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s email newsletter.",https://theintercept.com/2017/12/01/the-gop-plan-is-the-biggest-tax-increase-in-american-history-by-far/,
Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,False,False,False,True,Unrelated,,Largest Tax Cut in History?,"Will the Republican tax plan be the “largest tax cut in history,” as the Trump administration has repeatedly said? That’s still unknown. But past tax cuts have been larger than cost estimates of the GOP plan.President Donald Trump and others in the administration have been making the “largest tax cut” claim for months. We wrote about a Trump-for-president campaign committee TV ad that made the claim in May. The president made the boast again on Sept. 27, the day the White House and GOP leaders released the framework of their tax plan, and, among many other examples, he repeated it on Twitter on Oct. 18, saying: “Hopefully, all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the talking point 10 days later.But so far, the White House hasn’t supported that claim and did not respond to our request for information.The tax plan is only a framework, with many details yet to be filled in. It would reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; abolish the alternative minimum tax; collapse the seven income tax brackets, which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, to three (12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent); increase the standard deduction but eliminate exemptions; eliminate most itemized deductions except for mortgage interest and charitable giving; increase the child tax credit; and abolish the estate tax.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said it “very roughly” estimated a $2.2 trillion cost over 10 years. (That’s similar to the Tax Policy Center’s estimate of a $2.4 trillion cost over 10 years.)“That would make this tax cut the 8th largest as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since 1918 and the 4th largest in inflation-adjusted dollars,” CRFB wrote in an Oct. 25 blog post.CRFB used a Treasury Department analysis that we also have referred to in the past. The 2013 report, by tax analyst Jerry Tempalski, detailed the revenue effects of major tax legislation. (Tempalski prepared such a report in 2006, and updated the tax tables in 2011, too.)The latest report shows that the “largest tax cut in history” designation would go to either President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut or President Barack Obama’s 2012 extension of most of the George W. Bush-era income tax cuts, depending on how the size of the tax cut is measured.As we’ve written before, the best measurement is the revenue effect as a percentage of gross domestic product. Tempalski wrote in 2006 that this measure “eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth, and the size of total federal receipts.” Over a four-year average, the revenue effect of Reagan’s 1981 tax cut was 2.89 percent of GDP. (Reagan’s cut also had the largest impact as a percentage of federal receipts over a four-year average.) That’s the most of any tax cut in the Treasury report, going back to 1940.Using CRFB’s cost estimate for the current Republican tax plan, the average revenue effect would be 0.9 percent of GDP over the 10-year period. That’s also lower than tax cuts implemented in 2010 and 2013, as well as those in 1948, 1945 and 1964, with the last three measured over just one year. (The Treasury report includes the four-year averages for tax measures since 1978, but uses shorter periods for prior years.)The CRFB analysis relies on a 2012 paper by University of California, Berkeley economists to look at pre-1940 tax cuts. That puts one more tax measure, in 1921, above the latest GOP proposal in terms of percentage of GDP.The GOP plan would have to be doubled or tripled in order to surpass the 1981 tax cut, CRFB said. “If President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.”We could also look at tax cuts in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars. By that measure, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (implemented in 2013) tops the list, costing $320.6 billion in 2012 dollars over a four-year average. The GOP tax plan would come in at $190 billion on an annual average in 2012 dollars, CRFB found. That would be the fourth largest tax cut — also behind tax reductions in 2010 ($210 billion) and 1981 ($208 billion).Using inflation-adjusted dollars “tends to have a bias towards recent tax cuts since the tax base usually grows faster than inflation,” CRFB says, noting that percentage of GDP is the “better way to compare costs over long time periods.”As we said, the GOP tax framework is still missing some details. The final tax bill hasn’t yet been written, although it may be released as early as Nov. 2. But the Trump administration’s claim of the “largest” tax cut in history remains unsupported, and disputed by budget experts.The plan may be limited to a cost of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, if lawmakers adhere to a Senate budget resolution that allowed for such an increase to the deficit to pay for the tax cuts. That would move the tax plan further down the list of the largest tax cuts in history.",http://www.factcheck.org/2017/11/largest-tax-cut-history/,
Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,Unrelated,False,True,Unrelated,Unrelated,,Biggest Tax Increase in History?,"Q: Is the new health care law “the biggest tax increase in history”?A: In raw dollars, perhaps. But several tax increases just since 1968 were larger as percentages of the economy, or in inflation-adjusted dollars.Will “Obamacare” be the largest tax hike in US history?Several readers have asked us about this since Rush Limbaugh made a hugely exaggerated claim that the new health care law is “the biggest tax increase in the history of the world.”We’re not sure Limbaugh meant his statement to be taken seriously; He offered no figures or citations to back up what he said. But other critics of the law have made similar claims.The increase is certainly large. So let’s take a look at how the taxes and fees that finance “Obamacare” stack up against earlier increases.There’s no question that the package of taxes and other revenue-raisers that the law contains constitute a large increase. The most recent estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation puts the total for more than a dozen different tax increases and other “revenue-related provisions” at $675 billion between now and 2022.And that’s not counting the effect of penalty payments by individuals who refuse to take out health insurance (estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to be $54 billion over the same period. The JCT tax estimate also doesn’t count penalties paid by large employers (those with 50 employees or more). CBO estimates they will pay $113 billion during the period, rather than provide insurance coverage for their workers.But is this increase the largest in American history? Perhaps — as measured by the rather useless yardstick of raw dollars, with no adjustment for inflation. We rely here on recently updated tables from U.S. Treasury Department tax analyst Jerry Tempalski, whose 2006 paper on “Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills” is the standard reference for making such comparisons.Tempalski (a career employee who has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations) uses unpublished Treasury Department estimates, which are by no means low-ball figures. Treasury’s figures for the health care law are actually higher than those of either JCT or CBO for the key year 2014, when major provisions of the law take effect.We’ve used Tempalski’s figure for that year — the highest one he cites — and compared it to the highest 1-year figure given for each of the tax increases since 1968. (No earlier tax increase comes close in terms of unadjusted dollars.)By this measure, the Affordable Care Act’s $76.8 billion in revenue increases tops the $65.9 billion for the highest single year for Bill Clinton’s 1993 deficit reduction bill, which Republicans have for years attacked as the biggest in history. But as we’ve said before, that attack is misleading, and the raw-dollar measure is a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase.For one thing, that measure doesn’t take account of inflation. Using “constant” dollars — all adjusted to equal the value of a dollar in 2009 — the ACA drops to fourth place, and the tax increase signed in 1982 by President Reagan becomes the largest since 1968.But even this measure takes no account of a population that is steadily rising. Today’s population is 82 million higher than it was at the time of Reagan’s 1982 increase, and 56 million higher than it was when Clinton signed the 1993 increase. So the average tax increases in those years was accordingly higher on a per-person basis than the ACA.Incomes are also up since those times — even adjusting for inflation, and despite declines since the economic crisis of 2008. So the effect on the average person’s paycheck would be reduced even further, compared to earlier increases.So what is the best yardstick for measuring changes in taxation?  “The single best measure for most purposes is probably the revenue effect as a percentage of GDP, because it eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth, and the size of total federal receipts,” Tempalski wrote in 2006. We concur, as do most tax experts we know of.And by that measure, the revenue increases in the ACA are smaller than most of the increases enacted since 1968 — and less than one-quarter the size of the largest.None of these comparisons are entirely satisfactory. For example, the 1968 law that we show as the largest, measured by its biggest one-year effect, was a temporary blip. It was Lyndon Johnson’s “Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968,” and was primarily a one-year, 10 percent surcharge on both individual and corporate income taxes that expired in 1969.And Reagan’s 1982 tax increase followed an even more massive tax cut the previous year, which had overshot the mark. Taken together, Reagan’s 1981 tax cut and 1982 tax increase still netted out to a very substantial reduction in taxes.Furthermore, Tempalski’s comparative tables look no further than the fourth year after enactment for any of the tax changes it studies. Since some of the ACA’s tax changes  are still being phased in during fiscal 2014, the increase may be larger in later years.Finally, all these figures (including those for the ACA) are based on the Treasury Department’s estimates as generated during the first year after enactment. But sometimes estimates are wide of the mark. For example, revenues from Jimmy Carter’s “Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of 1980” were estimated to be $21 billion in 1984, and our charts here are based on that estimated figure. But Tempalski writes that as things turned out, “actual revenues were probably less than $4 billion.”In short, there are too many moving parts in both the ACA and in earlier tax laws to make simple comparisons that are valid for all purposes. Comparisons of the one-year effect of the ACA’s fifth or sixth year might show it as moving higher relative to earlier laws, but we don’t have fifth-year or sixth-year estimates for those laws to make the comparison, so we can’t say. We have done the best we can using available figures and a consistent methodology.Despite all these uncertainties, one thing is abundantly clear. There’s no way the ACA’s tax and other revenue increases come close to being the largest in U.S. history.That distinction — based on Tempalski’s figures — goes to the “Revenue Act of 1942” which raised taxes by an estimated 5.04 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in order to finance America’s war effort. The ACA would need to be perhaps a dozen times larger to rival that.Footnote: Some critics of the law use the term “tax” in a very loose way, characterizing the premiums paid to insurance companies by those who choose to comply with the new mandate as a “tax.” We have no quarrel with those who call the penalties themselves a “tax,” as we’ve said previously. But we can’t agree to call insurance premiums a “tax,” any more than we would call them a tax when state governments require auto liability insurance for car owners.“[I]f both the premium and the penalty are considered a tax, the mandate becomes the largest tax increase in U.S. history,” writes Merrill Matthews, a conservative commenter on the Forbes.com website. Perhaps so, but that’s not the usual definition of a tax, which is a compulsory contribution to state revenue.

If enacted, Trump's plan would have been biggest tax hike, in total raw dollars, in history.",Donald Trump once proposed the largest tax hike in American history | FreedomWorks,"In his FY 2016 budget, President Barack Obama proposed $1.44 trillion in new taxes over the next ten years. Though his tax proposal is not likely to be passed by Congress, it comes on top of hikes he already managed to enact, such as the fiscal cliff deal that increased taxes by $620 billion and the $1 trillion of taxes in ObamaCare. Conservative activists, rightly, slammed the tax hikes, which have contributed to a slow economic recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession.As much of a serial tax hiker as President Obama may be, he is probably envious of a little-known tax proposal put forward by Donald Trump in 1999, when he was flirting with a bid for the White House with the Reform Party. Trump shuttered his campaign not long after launching it, but not before he gave an interview to ABC News in November 1999 in which he outlined his tax plan.Well, basically, this would be a one-time tax, 14.25 percent against people with a net worth of over $10 million. It would pay off in its entirety the national debt of $5.7 trillion, and you'd save $200 billion a year, Trump said. So taxes for the middle class would go way down, the estate and inheritance tax totally wiped out, and the Social Security system would be saved.At the time, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the public's share of the national debt held by the public was $3.6 trillion, or just under 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). (For perspective, the CBO, in June 2015, pegged the public's share at approximately $13.1 trillion, or 73 percent of GDP.) Congress, controlled by Republicans, had produced balanced budgets in 1998 and 1999. The long-term outlook was positive, before the era of fiscal profligacy ushered in by President George W. Bush and President Obama.The proposal, which would have raised $5.7 trillion, would have been the largest tax increase in American history. The journalist discussing the issue with Trump noted that people who have a net-worth of $10 million or more are not necessarily liquid, meaning that they did not have enough cash lying around to pay the tax.Some people would be able to sell [assets] off easily [and] pay the tax, Trump replied, noting that the tax would be enforced over ten years. He also claimed that those who were subjected to the tax would get their money back because of the booming economy. The idea may have been attractive, but, at the time, deficits and debt, while important issues, were managed. Long-term problems, such as Medicare and Social Security, still remained.Still, the effects of Trump's tax proposal -- again, what would have been the largest tax hike in American history -- would have had severe consequences, far from the boom he claimed it would create. While everyone loves an easy fix, this proposal was poor tax policy, wrote Brandon Lecoq of the Tax Foundation. Assets are mostly illiquid, meaning people own property, businesses, cars, gold, and other valuables that aren’t in money form. This one-time tax would require many millionaires to sell off physical assets in a very short period of time. Even if this were possible, liquidating $5.7 trillion worth of assets would be catastrophic for the economy.Lecoq noted that the tax is retroactive, which is terrible policy. Citizens deserve sound tax policy, which includes stability and no retroactivity, he explained. One-time revenue raisers are proposed frequently, but they are unfair and cause people to change their behavior in response to an unpredictable policy environment.Since launching his campaign in June, Trump has not offered detailed tax plan, though he has said that he wants to simplify the tax code and raise taxes on wealthy Americans. He has also shown a willingness to raise or impose new tariffs on goods imported into the United States. Tariffs, of course, are passed along to consumers and can wreak havoc on the economy.After nearly a decade of slow economic growth, Americans have learned that tax hikes and economic intervention do not work as those who peddle these ideas so often claim. It is understandable that people, frustrated by politicians who do not listen to them, are looking for something different, but they should be careful that the same stale ideas are not simply just being repackaged under a different brand.",http://www.freedomworks.org/content/donald-trump-once-proposed-largest-tax-hike-american-history,

Here’s how big it would have to be.,"President Trump has promised to reveal the broad strokes of a plan to cut Americans' taxes this week -- a plan he says will be historic in scope.It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had, Trump told the Associated Press on Friday.If Trump hopes to make good on that pledge, he'll have tough competition. The ambitious plan Trump put forward during the campaign is smaller, relative to the size of the economy overall, than the cut President Ronald Reagan enacted soon after taking office in 1981.Proponents of a big tax cut say it is a straightforward way for Trump to win a political victory in Congress, giving Americans more money to spend and stimulating the economy with what is likely to be a popular policy.Yet critics, including many conservative economists, warn that an aggressive reduction in taxes could force the federal government to borrow more to make up for the foregone money. The result would be more national debt and steeper interest rates, as the government competes with ordinary businesses and households for loans.Here is a look at the largest tax cuts in modern American politics.Just months after the Allied victory, President Harry S. Truman signed a bill that was projected to bring down taxes by the equivalent of 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, a measure of overall economic activity. Since then, only Reagan passed a larger tax cut relative to GDP, according to a report the Treasury Department published in 2006.As it is difficult to compare tax cuts from one decade to another, because what a cut means for ordinary people can depend on how well they are doing financially. Likewise, taxes are typically assessed on some percentage of one aspect of the economy -- whether wages, sales, property or investments -- so an equivalent reduction in taxes will have a very different effect depending on the pace of economic activity overall.For these reasons, comparing the size of a change in taxes to GDP gives a good approximate sense of the measure's significance at the time it was enacted.Later in his presidency, Truman soured on the idea of cutting taxes. Although the war was over, he argued, the government needed money to help rebuild Europe, provide benefits to veterans and invest in domestic infrastructure. At the same time, Truman felt that policymakers should work to pay down the debts the government had accumulated during the war.Despite Truman's objections, Congress enacted a second mammoth tax cut in 1948, decisively overriding Truman's veto. That bill was projected to reduce revenue by 1.9 percent of GDP, according to the Treasury report.Although President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the next major reduction in taxes in 1964, those cuts are often associated with President John F. Kennedy, who had advocated them forcefully before his assassination. Overall, the change was expected to reduce revenue by 1.6 percent of GDP, the report shows.Johnson and Kennedy were Democrats, but the plan that Johnson enacted featured what would soon become a typical feature of Republican tax policy: a drastic reduction in taxes for the richest taxpayers. Johnson's signature reduced the marginal rate on their income from 91 percent to 70 percent.That was the direction Reagan pursued, arguing that bringing down marginal rates would make federal taxes more efficient. Allowing taxpayers to keep more of their income would encourage them to work and invest, increasing economic activity and resulting in more federal revenue to make up for some of the reduction in rates.Reagan's tax cut was projected to reduce collections by 2.9 percent of GDP. Yet Reagan quickly retreated from that enormous cut, in part because the federal government was running short on money. By 1984, he had signed two significant bills increasing taxes, undoing roughly half of his initial cut.Taking those measures into account, Reagan's reductions in taxes were similar in size to those enacted by Johnson.Reagan's successors continued to raise taxes. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton both increased revenue, and those increases combined with a robust economy to create a budgetary surplus by the time Clinton left office.President George W. Bush took advantage of the surplus to bring down taxes. He signed bills in 2001, 2002 and 2003 that were projected to reduce federal revenue by 0.7 percent, 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, according to the Treasury report.By the time Bush left office in 2009, the economy was in a severe recession, and President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress enacted a substantial tax cut as part of their stimulus. The bill was projected to bring down taxes by 0.6 percent of GDP, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal data.Obama's legacy is not usually thought of as reducing taxes, but he did help to extend Bush's tax cuts. The legislation he signed at the beginning of 2013 not only made many of those cuts permanent, but also extended many provisions from the stimulus.Doing so prevented a major increase in taxes, although whether that should be considered a tax cut is debatable. In total, that legislation was projected to reduce revenues by 1.8 percent of GDP relative to what would have occurred had Obama done nothing, The Post's analysis showed.The analysis compared forecasts issued by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation at the time of the legislation, along with contemporaneous forecasts for GDP from the Congressional Budget Office.The plan Trump put forward as a candidate would reduce revenues by 2.6 percent of GDP, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That would be less than the cuts that Truman saw through in 1945 as well as those that Reagan enacted in 1981, at least initially.The president has said he will give more information about his plans with respect to taxes on Wednesday, although he seems to be maintaining at least one important feature of the earlier proposal. Trump has decided to reduce the rate on corporate income from 35 percent to 15 percent, The Post reported, a change that would reduce collections by about $2.4 trillion over a decade.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/25/trump-just-promised-the-biggest-tax-cut-in-history-heres-how-big-it-would-have-to-be/,

Most Americans pay taxes somewhere between the two.The president would eliminate the estate tax and alternative minimum tax, a parallel system that primarily hits wealthier people by effectively limiting the deductions and other benefits available to them — both moves that would richly benefit Mr. Trump. Little is known of Mr. Trump’s tax burden, but one of the small nuggets revealed in the partial release of a 2005 tax return this year was that he paid $31 million under the alternative minimum tax that year.Corporations would not have to pay taxes on their foreign profits, an unusual proposal for a president who has championed an “America first” approach and railed against companies that move jobs and resources overseas. They would also enjoy a special, one-time opportunity to bring home cash that they are parking overseas, though administration officials would not say how low that rate would be or how they would ensure that the money would be invested productively.Mr. Trump wants to double the standard deduction for individuals, essentially eliminating taxes on around $24,000 of a couple’s earnings. That proposal was met with alarm by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would disincentivize the purchase of homes. The proposal would scrap most itemized deductions, such as those for state and local tax payments, a valuable break for taxpayers in Democratic states like California and New York.But the president would leave in place popular breaks for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings.In a brief session with reporters, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin said they had been toiling for weeks on the proposal, much of which closely resembles the plan Mr. Trump championed as a presidential candidate. They argued that it would spur robust economic growth that would — along with the elimination of deductions — cover the potentially multitrillion-dollar proposal entirely, a prospect that even many Republicans privately concede is virtually impossible.“This will pay for itself with growth and with reduction of different deductions and closing loopholes,” Mr. Mnuchin said, repeating his optimistic estimate that the plan would spur the economy to grow at a rate of 3 percent annually. “The economic plan under Trump will grow the economy and will create massive amounts of revenues, trillions of dollars in additional revenues.”Democrats rejected what they described as magical thinking behind the plan and condemned it as a giveaway to the rich masquerading as a tax overhaul.“This is an unprincipled tax plan that will result in cuts for the 1 percent, conflicts for the president, crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. “Instead of providing a real tax reform plan as promised, this administration is offering cakes to the fortunate few.”Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm, was unsparing.“The effort to introduce more fiscal stimulus into the economy is genuinely underway,” he wrote to clients. “But the bare bones plan we saw unveiled today is already conceptually flawed and unlikely to go far in Congress. The final product will bear no resemblance to the principal points highlighted in today’s meager release. Certainly, the first step in this process was unimpressive.”Mr. Cohn said the plan was “the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986” — the last time a comprehensive tax overhaul was enacted — as well as “one of the biggest tax cuts in American history,” in line with Mr. Trump’s grandiose portrayal.As expected, the White House did not include in its plan the border adjustment tax on imports that was a centerpiece of a plan developed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said the White House could not support that proposal “in its current form,” setting up an intraparty struggle over the elements of a tax plan and how to offset the deep reductions envisioned.But Republican leaders who are eager for large tax cuts did not allow their internal divisions over elements of the package to obscure their overall support for Mr. Trump’s effort.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady issued a joint statement with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, saying the principles outlined Wednesday would “serve as critical guideposts” as Congress and the administration worked together on a tax overhaul.Mr. Trump also signaled support for revisions to the tax code that would help families with child-care costs, although his document provided no details. He called for ending the 3.8 percent tax on investment income that was imposed by the Affordable Care Act, restoring the capital gains rate to 20 percent.Democrats are ready to battle Mr. Trump over the tax cuts, which they are determined to tie to his refusal to release his tax returns.“Trump’s latest proposal is another gift to corporations and billionaires like himself,” said Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic Party chairman. “Trump must release his tax returns, as millions of Americans are demanding, before Congress can consider any Trump tax plan. We must know how much Trump would personally financially benefit from his own proposal.”Questioned about that repeatedly on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump, the first president in four decades not to disclose at least a portion of his tax returns, had “no intention” of releasing them now.“I can’t comment on the president’s tax situation since I don’t have access to that, O.K.?” Mr. Mnuchin said when asked how large of a tax cut the president would receive under his own plan.The plan contrasts starkly with the one championed by House Republicans, who proposed paying for their tax cuts in part with the new tax on imports, an effort to ensure that the measure would not swell the deficit.The White House plan does call for “a territorial system to level the playing field for American companies,” akin to a component of House Republicans’ plan that would allow United States corporations to pay taxes only on their domestic profits.“I worry that the Trump proposal would shift a tremendous amount of income abroad,” said Alan B. Krueger, who was a chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “It’s hard to square that with incentivizing investment in the U.S.”Republicans have long called for permanent, comprehensive changes to the tax code, but lately they have shown increasing openness to tax cuts with an expiration date. If they embark on a plan to pass legislation that adds to the deficit and cannot be filibustered by Democrats, Senate budget rules dictate that the tax cuts would expire after a decade.“If we have them for 10 years, that’s better than nothing,” Mr. Mnuchin said.Democrats were particularly critical of Mr. Trump’s idea of allowing firms known as pass-through entities — including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump’s and large partnerships — that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent, to be eligible for the 15 percent corporate rate.Critics worry that lawyers, doctors, consultants and other individuals in partnerships could structure much of their personal income as business income, effectively reducing their tax rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.Mr. Mnuchin said the administration would not allow that to happen.“We will make sure that there are rules in place so that wealthy people can’t create pass-throughs and use that as a mechanism to avoid paying the tax rate that they should be on the personal side,” he said.The explanation did not seem to mollify Democrats.“We don’t need a tax plan that allows the very rich to use pass-throughs to reduce their rates to 15 percent while average Americans are paying much more,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. “That’s not tax reform. That’s just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan.html,

Any automatically-triggered tax increase is bad policy and bad for the economy. Conservatives cannot support this tax increase. Even President Obama supported automatic spending cuts rather than triggering future tax increases. Future deficits should be resolved with spending cuts before tax increases are ever contemplated.The revenue trigger imposes tax increases that would go into effect if the bill's tax cuts result in raising the deficit. The ACUF has been consistent in our message that the key to strong tax reform lies in ensuring that American taxpayers are not burdened with higher tax rates and in legislation that helps stimulate and revitalize the economy. The provision would add a layer of complexity to the tax code that would effectively hinder job growth and undercut efforts to safeguard taxpayers across the country. We urge Congress to remain steadfast in their commitment to the best interests of American taxpayers, American businesses, and the American Dream.National Taxpayers Union: “This is a seriously misguided approach that will ultimately undermine pro-growth tax reform legislation.”“By injecting uncertainty into the tax code, a trigger mechanism would certainly stymie economic growth, thereby resulting in a likely tax increase. This is a seriously misguided approach that will ultimately undermine pro-growth tax reform legislation. We have worked alongside policymakers for decades to preserve the nation’s fiscal health, and applaud efforts to decrease deficits by controlling spending. But expanding economic opportunities is also key to addressing the programs driving those deficits, making a trigger a self-defeating strategy even for those concerned about budget shortfalls. The nation’s fiscal future will be uncertain as long as the economic barriers created by the current tax code remain; a trigger only makes those barriers more difficult to tear down, especially for Americans seeking to get ahead. We urge the Senate to reject a tax hike trigger as it works to refine the tax reform bill and enact it into law.” – NTU President Pete SeppFreedomWorks: “It's frustrating that some Republican senators, who pride themselves as so-called 'deficit hawks,' demanded tax increases if growth targets weren't met, rather than spending cuts.”“Congress has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. It's frustrating that some Republican senators, who pride themselves as so-called 'deficit hawks,' demanded tax increases if growth targets weren't met, rather than spending cuts. These same senators regularly vote for more spending, making them part of the problem.“If we can tie tax reform to spending cuts if we don’t meet revenue projections – fantastic.

And the purpose of tax cuts is to create a more vibrant economy, not to take more dollars from American citizens.” -- FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs Jason PyeWall Street Journal editorial board: “A trigger is a bad idea on the policy merits.”Club for Growth: “The idea of a ‘tax hike trigger’ should be rejected on its merits.”“The idea of a ‘tax hike trigger’ should be rejected on its merits,” stated Club for Growth President David McIntosh.“Any senator who understands basic business principles and truly cares about the deficit should understand that this trigger is an automatic tax increase and will actually harm economic growth. It will have harmful impacts on American businesses and undermine any economic growth potential in this tax reform bill because businesses will not invest due to the possibility of a higher tax rate.“What Senators Lankford and Corker are saying here is that if the deficit gets too large, then they want to tax people more. Here’s an idea. How about cutting spending? Just yesterday Senator Lankford issued 100 wasteful examples of federal spending. But instead of cutting the programs, ironically, Senator Lankford would allow wasteful measures like them to continue to receive funding – through his automatic tax increases no less!“If they’re truly worried about the deficit and they want to establish a trigger, then they should limit the size of government. A spending cut trigger would be a far better idea.” – Club for Growth President David McIntoshU.S. Chamber of Commerce: “Impractical, unreasonable, and unnecessary.”“While one can appreciate the intentions, the fact remains a fiscal trigger is a terrible idea.The flaws of the fiscal trigger, whereby taxes would rise if revenues disappointed are many, but let us focus on the biggest. The most obvious is, against what metric would a shortfall be counted? Are the trigger’s proponents willing to embrace a particular estimate for the additional growth and associated revenue gains? Without such a dynamic revenue estimate, the trigger is an illusion.” – J.D. Foster, Senior Vice President, Economic Policy Division, and Chief Economist“Yes, it’s an impractical idea. It’s an awful idea.  A ‘trigger’ takes the growth out of pro-growth tax reform. Entrepreneurs want predictability along with reforms that promote investment and sustainable economic growth. The threat of a trigger will harm investment in small businesses and startups and reboot the uncertain economic and policy environment that we are working furiously to get out of.  A trigger undermines many of the reasons for doing tax reform in the first place, which is to make our tax system more competitive and spur strong investment and economic growth. Can we just move on with positive, pro-growth tax reform and ditch the trigger idea?” -- Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) president & CEO Karen KerriganCampaign for Liberty: “The main problem with the trigger is a moral one. The idea that Congress can give and take away tax cuts is rooted in the idea that all property belongs to the state and so any money not taxed is a gift from government that government can take away at will.”“Finally, one proposal on the table is to attach a ‘trigger’ to the tax that would automatically raise taxes if the bill’s tax cuts raised the deficit. Tax cuts that could be taken away at any time obviously hinders the incentive to invest in new businesses and thus limits the tax cuts pro-growth effects, making an increase in the deficit a self-fulfilling prophecy.The prospect of automatic tax increases also removes any incentive for Congress to stop spending. However, the main problem with the trigger is a moral one. The idea that Congress can give and take away tax cuts is rooted in the idea that all property belongs to the state and so any money not taxed is a gift from government that government can take away at will. This is the exact opposite of the truth as stated in the Declaration of Independence.” – Norm Singleton, President of Ron Paul’s Campaign for Liberty“The proposed federal tax increase triggers get the idea completely backwards. Tax triggers have been effectively used to bring additional tax relief for taxpayers after healthy revenue growth. The highly successful North Carolina tax reform provides great evidence showing how tax triggers should be used. It's disappointing to see so called fiscal conservatives advocate for tax triggers that would automatically raise tax rates if economic growth is not realized. Our tax code doesn't need any additional uncertainty. A much better approach would force government to re-prioritize spending decisions.” – Jonathan Williams, ALEC Chief Economist and Vice President, Center for State Fiscal ReformHeritage Foundation economist Romina Boccia: “Including a potential tax increase through a trigger or by any other means creates uncertainty, which will lower the overall economic growth we can expect to see from the tax plan.”Heritage Foundation budget analyst Adam Michel: Holding pro-growth tax reform hostage over the near-tern deficit impact is counterproductive and unwittingly undermines the very growth that tax reform promises.Freedom Partners: “The very threat of looming tax hikes could be a drag on growth all by itself.”“It’s hard to imagine a more counterproductive policy than imposing automatic tax hikes on an economy that isn’t growing as fast as expected. Furthermore, the very threat of looming tax hikes could be a drag on growth all by itself. If revenue is a concern, there is plenty of corporate welfare and wasteful spending left to cut. History has shown that tax cuts consistently lead to increases in federal revenue as a result of robust economic growth. We’re hopeful Congress won’t undermine the many positive reforms in the Senate bill with this self-destructive policy.” -- Freedom Partners Executive Vice President Nathan Nascimento“So-called ‘triggers’ for future tax HIKES are destructive & a threat to economic growth. #TaxBill should reject. We need competetive rates & predictability.” – Steve Moore, Heritage Foundation Economist, FreedomWorks Senior Economic ContributorRep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas): “I can’t think of a worse way to tank the economy than to raise taxes.”Sen. Rand Paul: I'm not very excited about having any automatic raises in taxes.”Rep.

Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/,True,False,False,False,False,Unrelated,,Is President Trump's Tax Cut the Largest in History Yet?,"President Trump has often stated that his proposed tax cut will be the largest in history. We previously found his $5.5 trillion framework in April would have been among the largest but not the largest. Now that the plan costs less than half as much, it would definitely not be the largest in history.Most recently, Trump called it the biggest tax cut in U.S. history in a tweet Wednesday morning . We very roughly estimated that the Big Six framework for President Trump's proposed tax cut could cost $2.2 trillion over ten years, though many details are still missing. That would make this tax cut the 8th largest as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since 1918 and the 4th largest in inflation-adjusted dollars. If the bill was instead limited to the $1.5 trillion cost allowed by the Senate budget resolution, it would be the 12th largest as a percent of GDP and 4th largest in real dollars.To evaluate this claim, we use a 2013 Treasury Department analysis that compares the projected revenue effect of major tax bills since 1940. The analysis uses one-year estimates for laws enacted between 1940 and 1967, two-year estimates for laws enacted between 1968 and 1977, and four-year estimates for laws enacted since 1978. For estimates of tax bills before 1940, we use a paper by Christina Romer and David Romer that uses one-year estimates.As a percent of GDP, the largest tax cut since 1918 was the 1981 tax cut enacted at the beginning of the Reagan Administration. This tax cut cost 2.9 percent of GDP over four years, and the cost of the bill would have grown significantly over time, reaching 4.2 percent in the fourth year (though Congress partially reversed those cuts in later years). The second-largest cut was in 1945 when lawmakers rolled back some of the revenue increases that had been enacted to fund World War II; this tax cut cost 2.7 percent of GDP in the year after its enactment.If President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years. By another measure, the 1981 tax cut reduced federal revenue by 13 percent. If President Trump wanted to reduce revenue by as much, it would cost roughly $5.7 trillion. By either measure, the unified framework that costs $2.2 trillion by our estimate would fall well short of the largest tax cut in history.Meanwhile, President Trump's tax cut would be the 4th largest in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1940. Notably, four out of the five largest tax cuts in history in inflation-adjusted dollars have taken place in the past 16 years. This measure tends to have a bias towards recent tax cuts since the tax base usually grows faster than inflation. Therefore, a 5 percent cut in individual income taxes would cost more now in inflation-adjusted dollars than it would in previous years. Because of this trend, cost as a percent of GDP is a better way to compare costs over long time periods.President Trump's proposed tax cut would not be the largest tax cut in history, nor should it be. In light of rising debt and deficits, lawmakers should pursue at least revenue-neutral tax reform to grow the economy, not expensive tax cuts that do not pay for themselves.",http://www.crfb.org/blogs/president-trumps-tax-cut-largest-history-yet,

But it's worth considering just what Reagan did -- and didn't do -- as lawmakers grapple with many of the same issues that their 1980s counterparts faced: a deep recession, high deficits and a rip-roaring political divide over taxes.  Soon after taking office in 1981, Reagan signed into law one of the largest tax cuts in the postwar period. That legislation -- phased in over three years -- pushed through a 23% across-the-board cut of individual income tax rates. It also called for tax brackets, the standard deduction and personal exemptions to be adjusted for inflation starting in 1984. That would reduce ""bracket creep"" since the high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s meant incomes rose very fast, pushing taxpayers into ever higher brackets even though the real value of their income hadn't changed. The 1981 bill also made certain business deductions more generous. In 1986, Reagan lowered individual income tax rates again, this time in landmark tax reform legislation. As a result of the 1981 and 1986 bills, the top income tax rate was slashed from 70% to 28%. Despite the aggressive tax cutting, Reagan couldn't ignore the budget deficit, which was burgeoning. After Reagan's first year in office, the annual deficit was 2.6% of gross domestic product. But it hit a high of 6% in 1983, stayed in the 5% range for the next three years, and fell to 3.1% by 1988. (By comparison, this year it's projected to be 9% but is expected to drop considerably thereafter.) So, despite his public opposition to higher taxes, Reagan ended up signing off on several measures intended to raise more revenue. ""Reagan was certainly a tax cutter legislatively, emotionally and ideologically. But for a variety of political reasons, it was hard for him to ignore the cost of his tax cuts,"" said tax historian Joseph Thorndike. Two bills passed in 1982 and 1984 together ""constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime,"" Thorndike said. The bills didn't raise more revenue by hiking individual income tax rates though. Instead they did it largely through making it tougher to evade taxes, and through ""base broadening"" -- that is, reducing various federal tax breaks and closing tax loopholes. For instance, more asset sales became taxable and tax-advantaged contributions and benefits under pension plans were further limited. ""What people forget about Ronald Reagan was that he very much converted to base broadening as a means of reducing deficits and as a means of tax reform,"" said Eugene Steuerle, an Institute Fellow at the Urban Institute who had helped lay the groundwork for tax reform in 1986 and served as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary during Reagan's second term. There were other notable tax increases under Reagan. In 1983, for example, he signed off on Social Security reform legislation that, among other things, accelerated an increase in the payroll tax rate, required that higher-income beneficiaries pay income tax on part of their benefits, and required the self-employed to pay the full payroll tax rate, rather than just the portion normally paid by employees. The tax reform of 1986, meanwhile, wasn't designed to increase federal tax revenue. But that didn't mean that no one's taxes went up. Because the reform bill eliminated or reduced many tax breaks and shelters, high-income tax filers who previously paid little ended up with bigger tax bills.  ""Some of these taxpayers were substantial contributors to the Republican Party and to the president's re-election campaign, and had direct access to the White House. Reagan rebuffed their pleas,"" wrote J. Roger Mentz, the Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy in 1986, in a Tax Notes commentary last year. All told, the tax increases Reagan approved ended up canceling out much of the reduction in tax revenue that resulted from his 1981 legislation. Annual federal tax receipts during his presidency averaged 18.2% of GDP, a smidge below the average under President Carter -- and a smidge above the 40-year average today. How might Reagan fare today? Reagan's behavior might not pass muster with those voters today who insist their Congressmen treat every proposed tax increase as poisonous to the republic. ""By today's standards, the Gipper would easily qualify for status as a back-stabbing, treacherous RINO [Republican in Name Only],"" wrote Tax Analysts contributing editor Martin Sullivan, in an article for Tax Notes in May. Thanks in part to the increases in defense spending during his administration, Reagan also didn't really reduce the size of government. Annual spending averaged 22.4% of GDP on his watch, which is above today's 40-year average of 20.7%, and above the 20.8% average under Carter. Indeed, in one very symbolic respect he enlarged it. While in the early years of his presidency Reagan tried to shrink the IRS, by the end, the number of IRS employees hit an all-time high, according to Steuerle in his book Contemporary U.S. Tax Policy. The reason was two-fold, Steuerle said. The first was a desire to crack down on the proliferation of tax shelters. But the point of cracking down was to boost tax revenue. That, in turn, could reduce the need to impose other tax increases to combat budget deficits.",http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/08/news/economy/reagan_years_taxes/index.htm,

Taxes, unfortunately, remain stubbornly complicated — even in a system overhauled for simplicity.For most people, the answer would be yes. But it depends on who you are. Some of the simplification measures mean valuable tax breaks — like the head-of-household filing status — would vanish, leaving millions of families, including more than half of single parents, with a higher federal tax burden than in previous years, according to a report by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the Trump administration's proposed tax plan, comparing it with the current tax code to show who stands to gain the most — and who would wind up a loser — if Trump's plan became the law of the land.Below, we break down some various tax scenarios and how they affect different people. It's important to keep in mind that no law has been passed, so nothing is yet a given.While their plans have similarities, Trump and House Republicans don't agree on everything. It seems likely the main contours of Trump's plan will come to legislative fruition, but the chaotic political climate has banished certainty to the quarters of the foolish.Read on to see how your wallet would be affected under Trump's tax plan.",http://www.businessinsider.com/who-will-save-money-lose-trump-tax-plan-2017-2,

In addition to cutting the corporate tax rate and ending various deductions and loopholes, the plan significantly changes the individual income tax rate structure.The plan would reduce the number of income brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 35%, but keeps open an option for an additional tax rate bracket for the richest Americans. This is coupled with nearly doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for joint filers. The GOP did not release the endpoints for where the three income brackets would fall.Currently, the highest income earners pay a 39.6 percent marginal tax rate. Under the GOP plan, they would pay 35 percent. In addition, the plan would repeal the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, another cut that would aid the wealthy.According to the released plan, “an additional top rate may apply to the highest-income earners to ensure that the reformed tax code … does not shift the tax burden from high-income to lower- and middle-income taxpayers.”However, as the plan stands now, the highest-income earners would see their top tax rate return to the levels that followed President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. Since Bill Clinton’s administration, the highest income tax bracket has hovered around 35 percent to 40 percent.Before Ronald Reagan’s presidency, those who fell into the highest tax bracket paid over half of their income in income tax. Just after World War II and into the 1950s, the rate was over 90 percent.When tax cuts are given to the wealthy, lawmakers often justify the cut by claiming it will spur economic growth. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, conservative-leaning think tank, argued in its analysis of Trump’s 2016 campaign proposal that lowering the top income tax rate would lead to increased job opportunities.This core tenet of supply-side economics guided Reagan and Bush during consideration of their proposed tax cuts. Still, it's unclear whether cutting the income tax on the wealthy boosts economic growth.Take, for example, the Reagan administration’s full embrace of the theory, which coincided with economic growth in the mid-1980s. Many supply-siders use this example to advocate for cutting tax rates further.On the other hand, Bush’s administration proposed and Congress enacted a set of supply-side-focused tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that some blamed for the Great Recession.The Congressional Research Service published a paper in 2012 that found no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth. Congressional Republicans protested the findings, and the service briefly withdrew the paper.Republicans argued that the CRS paper had methodological errors, namely that it didn't account for the long-term benefits of tax rate cuts. The paper looked only at effects on growth within the first year of the cuts.POLITICO looked at each time the country changed the top income tax rate and the following five years of GDP per capita growth rate. The results are similar to the CRS findings: changing the top income tax rate does not have a predictable effect on economic growth.",https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/gop-tax-rate-cut-wealthy/,

That sounds like a lot, but it's equivalent to about one percent of gross domestic product, the leading measure of our nation’s economic output. By that measure, Trump's cut would be the eighth largest since 1918. Obama's 2013 cut, at 1.8 percent of GDP, was the fourth largest over that period. It saved American taxpayers $321 billion per year.The three largest tax cuts as a percentage of GDP were signed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman.Of course, Trump’s proposed cuts are only an outline, with details to be filled in by Congress, where Republicans will release their tax reform plan on Thursday.
